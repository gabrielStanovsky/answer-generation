I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire. Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry. I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs. Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper. I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it. When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs. As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning.

"I like to ride on trains because you can see lots of countryside without having to worry about driving . One time , when I lived in Alaska , I rode on a train from Fairbanks to Denali park . Just like with all train rides , I had to buy a ticket first and then I had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station . Then I climbed onto the train and picked a seat . The different places you can sit in a train are called cars . You do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit . So , I picked one in a car in the back and sat right beside the window . After the train started moving , a train attendant walked through to check our tickets and then I stood up to walk around . You can walk from car to car on a train and can even go out of the back of the very last car and stand outside , so I did that . It was very fun to be standing outside while the train was moving and I hung onto the railing to be sure I was safe . Then I went back inside and went to the dining car where I bought a sandwich and water . After I got back to my seat , I ate and watched the scenery through the window .

I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes, and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail my letter in.  After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers, and chose a heart design that I liked. I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to. When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly’s name and address in the middle, and wrote my sister’s address in the top left corner of the envelope. I stuck the stamp with the heart design on it in the upper right corner. Now it was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive it in about one week. I drove to the post office and put my letter in the outgoing mail slot. Shelly will be so surprised! Why are they mailing the letter?","I miss my best friend Shelly and so I decided to send her a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister’s house in Alaska, and to also tell her that I hoped she was well.

"The previous night and this morning before work I noticed I was missing a lot of necessary ingredients for my future meals . I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work . After I finished working I drove over to the store . It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot . Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . First , I picked up my deli . They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home .

"We spent a week getting our gear together for our big camping trip. After making sure everything was packed and the tent had no holes from the last trip, we put everything into the car and set out on our way. After a four hour drive we arrived at the campgrounds. We found our spot and unpacked the car. First up was pitching the tent, then we set about making a fire to cook dinner. It took awhile to collect all the wood we needed and get it roaring, but once we got the food on the fire we could finally relax. After soaking in nature and enjoying our campfire meal, night had fallen and it was time for bed. We curled up in our sleeping bags and told scary stories until we drifted off. The next morning we awoke early to stoke the fire and get breakfast started. A day of hiking and fishing went by far too fast and after another night under the stars we packed up our gear and headed home.

"It was a very hot sunny Saturday morning and me and my family decide to go to the beach. Before going to the beach we had to pack the car. We packed some snacks. We packed a cooler with all our drinks and water. We put on our bathing suits and brought towels, beach chairs, a beach umbrella, beach toys, and a beach ball. Mom brought sun tan lotion to protect us from the sun. Once we got to the beach mom and dad setup all off the chairs, umbrella and towels. Mom laid down on a towel while dad went running to the ocean. We swam but not too far because the water was very deep. There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards. There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles. Dad helped us build our sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in it would fill in our pool. At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water. There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguard had to blow his whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach. I have heard that sometimes you can see shark in the ocean but lucky for us we did not see any sharks. Visiting the beach was very fun for the whole family as mom can relax and get a tan and dad could play and swim with us. How did they keep lunch cold?","It was a very hot sunny Saturday morning and me and my family decide to go to the beach. Before going to the beach we had to pack the car. We packed some snacks.

"It was a very hot sunny Saturday morning and me and my family decide to go to the beach. Before going to the beach we had to pack the car. We packed some snacks. We packed a cooler with all our drinks and water. We put on our bathing suits and brought towels, beach chairs, a beach umbrella, beach toys, and a beach ball. Mom brought sun tan lotion to protect us from the sun. Once we got to the beach mom and dad setup all off the chairs, umbrella and towels. Mom laid down on a towel while dad went running to the ocean. We swam but not too far because the water was very deep. There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards. There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles. Dad helped us build our sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in it would fill in our pool. At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water. There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguard had to blow his whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach.

"Yesterday I hosted a barbecue for about twenty people. It was a really fun event and I enjoyed having my friends over to my beach house.

"Yesterday your father and I decided to go play a few rounds of tennis.  Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with two people, sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs.  There is a low net between both people playing the game.  We use tennis rackets and tennis balls to hit the ball back and forth to each other.  Sometimes one person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball so that person scores.  The person with the highest score without any fouls or out of bounds wins the set.  We played for a few hours before both of us became extremely tired, then we came home.

Once I have it home, I check it, finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish.  I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, vinegar and olive oil.  I might put a few onions in with it.  I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad.  Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer.

First, we got an oven pan and lined it with Aluminum foil. We opened a can of croissants and unrolled them. He cut each pastry triangle in half, so that each would be small and we could have more. He placed a slice of ham on the croissant piece and sprinkled it with shredded cheddar cheese. We began rolling up each piece from the long side, all the way until there was a croissant piece, ham and cheese rolled up. We placed them on the baking sheet and put them in the oven. In 15 minutes, they were golden brown and baked with love from my baby!",How did the food taste?,Good, Great!, very good, Delicious, Great, Wonderful
"The other day, my friend wanted to go outside.  I suggested that we go and play tennis.  He said that he had some racquets that we could play with, so I told him to bring them.

We started on opposite sides of the court and practiced hitting the balls over the net.  We did a really good job and decided to start playing.

"I decided that for Mother's Day I wanted to make a camping trip, so I called the camping grounds to reserve a space. Once I confirmed that our space was reserved for our trip, I began to pack our belongings in art suitcases. I packed pillows, bed sheets, pillows, food, medicine, toiletries, shoes, and anything else that I felt we needed to have with us while we were away. Additionally, I ensure that we had bug  repellent spray, hats and jackets to protect ourselves while out in the wild.

We went to the grocery store to pick up all of the necessary ingredients for a cookout next to the bonfire. We bought burgers, hot dogs, and buns for each. We made sure we had every vegetable available to go onto a burger including condiments and cheeses. We picked up several bags of chips and ingredients for s'mores. We arrived at the beach just before sunset and built the bonfire with the very long logs. Once we felt like they were all in place, we lit the fire and began to cook so everything would be ready for our guests once they arrived.

"We were excited about the awesome new mall and planned all week to visit it this past weekend! I called my sisters and friends and we all decided to meet in the front at noon on Saturday. There was plenty of parking and nice security cameras to keep us safe. We walked in the first large store and everyone decided to split up and meet at the food court two hours later. Alone, I looked at the ladies shoes. I bought a pair of dress up shoes and walked over to the nearby makeup. They were having a promotion so I bought my favorite kind to get a free bag and then checked out a new kind before I bought some and lipstick. Both were priced great. Next, I went to the housewares section and bought a coffee maker in black. Hand mixers were on sale across the isle so I bought one for the camp. The color I chose is red to match the blender. Next, I left the large store and went to nearby children's store to pick out toys for my kids. Four games and two balls looked great and exactly what they would like. Then I spotted some outdoor clothing and searched for something to give me to a little relief from daily laundry. After I went to a wonderful new ladies purse store and bought a new Gucci for the job interview ahead, I realized it was time to meet at the food court. Realizing it was all the way across the mall, I hurriedly walked that way and saw my friends and sisters standing in front waiting. We shared some strawberry ice cream and coffee before we walked back to our cars and said goodbye. As I drove home and thought about my purchases and good time with friends and family, I smiled.

"My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married .

It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go . People on the flight were pretty happy to finally leave and a lot of people were having drinks . Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas .

"We normally set a menu on Sunday for each day of the upcoming week to avoid chaos during dinner time. Before I leave for the day in the morning, I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal. At around five-thirty, I begin preparing the meal. One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and seasoned green beans. I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs, ketchup, and a bit of egg to bind it. I also lightly season it for flavor. I push it into the loaf pan, and put it in the oven to cook. I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans. I like to use fresh green beans. They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking them, but they taste so much fresher. I season them with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice. When the oven dings, dinner is ready for my family and I to enjoy.

"My hair is dirty and feels oily when I touch it today, so it is time to wash it. I like washing my hair in the shower because it is much easier than in a bath tub. I turn the shower on and make sure the water is nice and warm, but not too hot. I step in the shower and get my hair nice and wet. It is good to use shampoo and conditioner. First, I take some shampoo that I like and rub it onto my head. This cleans the part of the hair that is close to your head and also cleans the skin there that gets oily. After the shampoo is rubbed into my head, I let the water from the shower rinse out all the soap. Once the soap is out, I take some conditioner and rub it into the longer parts of my hair and the ends. This keeps it nice and soft and healthy. I let the conditioner sit in my hair for a while, and then rinse it all out in the warm water. I dry off, and feel better knowing that my hair is nice and clean again.

"When I was a boy scout, we went fishing to a lake.  When we were on the lake (it was frozen), we decided to fish for some fish.  We drilled a hole into the lake and caught a lot.

While casually browsing through my friends pictures online I discovered a new revelation . They are called Lush bath bombs and the are colorful scented fizz balls . I quickly ordered a few online from their website and when they came I was overcome with excitement . I brought a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one .

"I am so excited to learn how to drive today with Scott. We are in a large vacant parking lot and no one else is around so it will be perfectly safe for us, the car and anyone else. As we both get in the car, we put on our seatbelts. Check. Now he instructs me to put the key in the ignition and give it a gentle turn forward toward the front of the car. I hear the engine crank and can feel it hum. He tells me to grab the crankshaft and put it into the ""D"" position. I feel the car surge forward and immediately hit the brake pedal on the left and car stops. He tells me it's fine and to give it a little gas.

I love shopping online. Last weekend I wanted to order some vitamins. I looked on two web sites to find exactly the kind of vitamins I wanted. And I also looked at prices. I even tried to find some near me so that they would be shipped to me quick. The quickest way to get them and not have to pay too much money would cause them to get to me in four days. So I decided to order and wait. On Monday morning there was a package by my front door. I opened it. It was the vitamins. It took less than 24 hours for them to get to me. I was happy the vitamins were here. I tried to figure out how they go to me so quick. Then I figured out that they came from an Amazon facility near me. I might order from Amazon again since they got here quick. What website did they shop on?,I love shopping online. Last weekend I wanted to order some vitamins.

"Cooking fish is a fun and cool activity that many people can do because there are so many steps. First the step is to find a good sized fish. Now I know what your thinking, and you cannot just grab any ole fish out of a tank or something you found in a stream. You need a good fish with lots of meat and food on it.

"I sometimes put a gift in a box, if it doesn't already have one, to make it easier to wrap. It's nice to put tissue paper inside the box, too. That makes opening the gift more interesting. After I have the gift boxed, I assemble my wrapping supplies. I use rolled wrapping paper, clear tape, scissors, and ribbon. Next, I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper. I  study it, trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll. I don't want to waste paper, but I also want to neatly cover the gift. Once I decide how much paper to cut off, I mark the place with pencil, then fold there, and cut the paper along the fold line. Now I turn the gift upside down, and position it in the center of my paper. I pull up one end of the paper, and tape it to the center bottom of the box. I pull the other end of the paper smooth, pull it around  the box and tape it in place too. Then I do the ends of the package, folding the paper down, cutting it shorter if I must, and smoothing it neatly around the gift box. I tape it in place, and decorate the box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made. did they put a bow on their gift?","I sometimes put a gift in a box, if it doesn't already have one, to make it easier to wrap.

"Yesterday afternoon, my sister and I went to the outdoor neighborhood swimming pool. The pool requires that visitors either live in the neighborhood or be guests of a neighborhood resident in order to enter, and because we met those criteria, we had no problems getting in. The day was sunny and above eighty degrees. I wore my teal one-piece swimsuit and my sister wore her pink bikini. After we had walked to the pool from our house, we both lathered up with sunscreen and laid our towels and pool bags on vacant lounge chairs. There were only a dozen people at the pool. One of them was my sister's friend, so she left immediately to go splash around with her and hang out on a raft. I ordered a raspberry smoothie and laid out with my copy of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" while the sun heated my skin. When I started to sweat, I rinsed off in the provided shower and then put on my goggles and got into the pool to swim laps. Thankfully, the lap swim lane was clear, and I got a good work-out in. The day started to cloud over, and my sister's friend left, so after that the two of us sat in the shallow end of the pool with the warm water rising to our shoulders and chatted until we had both had our fill of pool time. We wrapped ourselves in our towels, put our flip-flops on, and walked home from the pool.

"This weekend , I decided I wanted to try baking my first cake . I found a recipe online for an easy to make cake , printed out a list of the ingredients , and went to the grocery store to get them . I knew about some of the common things , like eggs , flour , and sugar , but the list helped me get a lot of things I did n't own and would n't know to get . When I got home , I followed the recipe as closely as I could , adding each of the ingredients at the exact amount of the recipe asked for . I mixed them all up as described , and put them into a pan that I had borrowed from my mother . I put the pan in the oven and let the cake cook . I checked on it occasionally to see if it was looking OK , and because I was really excited to see how it was turning out . When it was done in the oven I removed it , and applied an extra thick coat of frosting . I was supposed to wait for the cake to cook , but I was too excited to try it out and ate it much sooner than recommended . It was delicious !

"Keeping a clean bathroom to me is an important part of good hygiene. This is something that I had to do just recently. I noticed that the toilet and counters were stained, and that the mirrors were filthy. I then set aside all of the necessary cleaners to use in the bathroom, and got to work. I first worked on the counter tops. I used a special marble cleaner to clean them, and it really made them shine. After the counters, I did the mirrors. I used a very strong glass cleaner to get the job done, and by the time I finished, the mirrors were spotless. Lastly, I took care of the toilet. I cleaned the outside of it with the same marble cleaner I used on the counters, and used a special toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of the bowl.

"Yesterday evening, my friend Jasmine called me on my cell phone. We talked about so many things and we were on the phone for about 2 hours. She asked me how life was ever since I moved from Denver to Atlanta. I told her that life had been amazing and the only thing that sucks, is the horrible traffic.

"My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish. Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market.  When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up.  When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones. Some of the fish he buys still has the head, fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too. The head of the fish is really good to make fish soup. I like it better when he leaves the scales (skin) of the fish as it tastes really good. There are many different ways that he cooks the fish. Sometimes he will  fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it.  He also bakes the fish in the oven which makes it soft and tender. My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi.  In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it.

"We had just come home from the beach one Saturday afternoon . We had a great time , but were very sweaty , sandy and sticky with old sunscreen , sweat and salt from the ocean . After unpacking the car , I had to take a bath . I love our deep soaking tub . I put in the drain plug and started running the water , making sure the temperature of the water was just right , and put in my favorite bath scents and soap . When the tub was full , I immersed myself deep into the tub and just let my body soak for a while . It was good to sit in the nice , warm water and let everything just relax and melt away from me . I washed my hair with my favorite shampoo , as I had a lot of sand in it from playing at the beach that day . I scrubbed my body well with a washcloth , to get off all the sand and ocean salt that had dried on my skin , along with the sunscreen that I had been using . It was very relaxing and I felt really good . I then pulled the drain on the tub and let all the dirty water go down . I had a big , fluffy bath towel that I dried off in , and I put on clean clothes . I was ready to finish up our fun day with some dinner and good times with my family .

"This past month, I was very busy with planning a party for my younger brother. I had to find out a number of things, but the most important one was figuring out who I could invite to the party. After I had a good enough idea, I went to the store and bought several themed party invitations. After buying the invitations, I spent a long time writing names and addresses for people that I wanted to invite to the party. After finishing the writing and putting all of the invitations in envelopes, I put stamps on them so they could all be mailed out as soon as possible. I made sure that all of the invitations had stamps and the correct addresses of the people who would be getting them, and put them in my mailbox for the postman to take them to the post office to be sent off.

"My friends and I love to go to the movie theater.  Every Tuesday, the movie theaters have cheap days, where you can go see a movie for $5, and then buy a drink and small snack for $5 too. So, we check online to see when the movies are playing, and we decide what we will see.  Then, once we do that, we all go in the car and drive to the theater right before the movie begins.  We park, and get out and stand in line for the tickets.  We usually all buy our own tickets, and then go in and order a drink and snack.  After that, we all go into the theater, and take our seats.  The movie always has previews before the real movie begins, so we have time to talk a little before the movie starts.

We park, and get out and stand in line for the tickets.  We usually all buy our own tickets, and then go in and order a drink and snack.  After that, we all go into the theater, and take our seats.  The movie always has previews before the real movie begins, so we have time to talk a little before the movie starts.  It also gives you time, if you were running late, to get there so you don't miss the movie.  We have a great time. How did they get tickets?","My friends and I love to go to the movie theater.

"It was a sad day.  June's great Aunt Martha had died a few days ago, and today was the day they would have her funeral.  Everyone in her family was dressed nicely, and made there way across town to the funeral home where the service would be held.  As the entered the room, there was a strong smell of flowers that made June's nose ache a little.  Her mom signed a book with her and her brothers names, and they made there way into a parlor where other people had gathered.  At the front of the room was a casket that was half way opened with Aunt Martha's body lying in it. The family made there way up to the front of the room to look at Aunt Martha. She looked as if she was taking a nap in her finest clothes.  Her make up and hair didn't really look like she used to wear them, but she didn't look scary like June had imagined.  They met some family members that were sad and crying, but others were laughing and remembering funny stories about Aunt Martha.  They made there way to a seat at the back of the parlor and a few songs were played while the curtains were drawn in the front  of the room.  When the curtains opened back up, the casket was closed with a large spray of flowers on top.  A pastor stood up and said some really nice things about Aunt Martha, and prayed.  The curtains closed again and the pastor told the crowd that the funeral would resume at Shady Oak Cemetery.  Afterwards, the group of people that had gathered made there ways to their car for the funeral procession to the cemetery.  June's family followed a long line of cars following a hearse with Aunt Martha's casket in the back.  A police man escorted the group of cars, and stopped traffic so the funeral procession didn't have to stop at red lights on the way to the cemetery.  As they pulled up to the gravesite, June saw a green tent with lots of folding chairs underneath, and a metal frame around a hole in the ground.  The family gathered around the tent as the pallbearers carried Aunt Martha's casket to the gravesite and placed it on the frame over the hole.

"It was a sad day.  June's great Aunt Martha had died a few days ago, and today was the day they would have her funeral.

"One day I was super hungry and craving a delicious cheese, spinach, and tomato pizza! I decide to alleviate my hunger and my craving by ordering a pizza from Domino's. I called Domino's to leave my order, and told them exactly what I wanted in a size medium. I did not order anything else when they asked me if I would like anything in addition! They then asked me if I would like delivery or pick up. I wanted to spend the evening relaxing after a long day and just watch movies with my pizza, so I opted for delivery. Twenty minutes later the delivery man arrived at my door with my pizza. I pull out my debit card and swiped it, because that was my preferred method of payment. I then had to sign for using my debt card, and also made sure I filled in the empty line that said tip bedside it. I made sure to leave the delivery man a generous one since he was here in a timely manner and was quite polite in dealing with me. After he proceeded back to his car,  I sat down on the couch and ate my pizza while watching one of my favorite movies. It was a successful evening and the pizza was scrumptious!

We looked at the wallpaper color samples and picked up a few brochures with examples of how the samples would look on our walls.

Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person, but if it was a large family it could be very messy.  All the left over plates, cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed.  The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills, so it is fresh and clean for the next diners.   And if there are placemats they too will need replacing.

It may involve fancy folded napkins, or how the glasses or utensils get lined up.

We arrived at the park and sat down on a bench so I can teach her how to use her camera. She opened the box and got her camera out. Penny pressed the big red button and the camera cut on. I showed her how to hold the camera correctly and how to take her first photo. Since then, Penny has learned how to take beautiful photographs. She is planning to teach other children how to take photos. Where was the photo taken?","My name is Katie and I am a professional photographer.

"It has been raining a lot and the lawn has been growing. So I mowed the lawn this morning. I had to go to the gas station to get some more gas to put into the lawn mower.

"I went to the Dallas Museum of Art yesterday. It was so much fun. I took my friend Becky. She loves art. When we got there we bought our tickets. I liked the big entrance with all types of art all around. First we went to the painting area. There were many paintings. We could have spent the whole day looking at all the paintings and talking about them. One painting had a lady in front of a house. It looked simple, but my friend Becky explained the painting to me. The painting had meanings or symbolism in it. She said it was like a story looking at the lady's facial expression and how her house looked. Next we went to look at the sculptures. There were very old ones and some modern ones as well. I think I liked the paintings better. I liked the colors of the painting.

"I went out to eat at a restaurant last weekend with my husband. We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but soon enough we were seated. The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel, and our waiter appeared right after we were seated. She was warm and friendly too. She greeted us and asked for our drink orders. My husband just wanted water, but I got an unsweet tea with lemon. We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on. We ordered our entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. Our waitress took the order, then promised to have our food out soon. We sampled the bread while she was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving, which we are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong. The smell was off and it had a bad taste. I thought it must be bad. I waited until our waitress was coming back by, then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different, because I felt like the salmon was going bad. She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. He said his was delicious. The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely. She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic. She kept checking on us throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert. He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. It was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed our meal, overall. Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal. We tipped generously and left satisfied.

We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on. We ordered our entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. Our waitress took the order, then promised to have our food out soon. We sampled the bread while she was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving, which we are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong. The smell was off and it had a bad taste. I thought it must be bad. I waited until our waitress was coming back by, then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different, because I felt like the salmon was going bad. She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. He said his was delicious. The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely. She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic. She kept checking on us throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert. He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. It was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed our meal, overall. Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal. We tipped generously and left satisfied.",Why were they disappointed?,Because the salmon had gone bad., They were not pleased., they did not like it, they enjoyed their meal, they enjoyed the meal, they were hungry
"Going to the dentist was hard for Mike. He was a little bit afraid of going, but his mom always went with him.  When he got to the dentist office, they were all nice to him.

"I always want to cook and finally I did it last night. I chose to have an egg-drop soup since it should be easy to do and great to taste.

"Billy decided he wanted to hang his new painting of a locomotive in his bedroom, he had the perfect spot picked, right above the cat tree in the corner of his bedroom.

"An unfortunate truth of life is that some day we all die. Sadly, I lost my grandmother a couple weeks ago. She was in poor health for the past eight years due to a stroke, and a second major stroke several weeks prior to her death left her completely incapacitated. It was a long distance to get to Wisconsin, so I flew out from New York the day before the wake. All my family was there, including my aunts, uncles, cousins, and parents. The wake was sad, but my family put together photos and a video from my grandmother's life, and we talked about the good times we remembered. The following morning, we attended the funeral, where my uncle gave a eulogy, the pastor gave a sermon, and we sang some of grandma's favorite hymns. We then drove in a procession, or long line of cars, to the graveyard, where we said our final goodbyes and cried.

"On a hot summer day nothing is better then going to a swimming pool.  There is one at the community center by us so we can walk there.  Before we go, we get into our bathing suits and put on our flip flops.  We make sure to pack snacks, and towels and drinks into a bag, and grab a float and a ball to play with.  We walk to the pool, the hot day making us even more excited to going swimming.  Once there, we hurry to find empty lounge chairs to put our towels on and waste no time getting into the pool.  The water feels so cold at first, but its so refreshing.  We swim around and realize we have friends there.  We play a game with the ball for a while before getting out for snacks.

"Last weekend I woke up in a bad mood.  I went to make some coffee to wake me up.  I ground up the coffee.  The coffee grinder was loud and woke up my wife.  She asked me to make her some coffee too!  I had to grind up some more beans.  I put some filtered water in a microwave safe container.  I put the container into our microwave, which was three years old!  I had to heat up the water for six minutes because our microwave is not that fast.  I placed a filter on top of a coffee cup for my wife.  I filled the filter up with the coffee I had ground.  I tamped down the coffee grounds with my hand.  Then I carefully poured the hot water from the microwave over the coffee grounds.  I allowed the water to soak into the coffee grounds, and I allowed the grounds to come to rest in the filter.

"Just recently, the light in my hallway went out, and since my younger brother is afraid of sleeping in the dark, this became an unnecessary problem. In order to calm him down, my dad went to the nearest hardware store to buy a brand new light bulb. He needed to make sure that the light bulb was the right size, so he took the old, burned out light bulb with him to compare. After finding the right size bulb, he paid for it and brought it back home. He then grabbed a nearby chair so that he could stand on to reach the empty socket where the bulb would go. He had me turn off the light switch, which would make sure that he would not get electrocuted while putting the bulb on or burned when it turns on. After less than 5 minutes, he is finished screwing in the bulb. We flip the switch to see if it works, and it does. My brother was now relieved.
