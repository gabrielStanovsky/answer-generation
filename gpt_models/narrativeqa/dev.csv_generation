He eventually lets those fears drive him to adopt a resolve to kill the critic ( who he assumes will also trash his play ) , and he procures a handgun with which to perform the deed . Instead of attending the play s opening night Rogan spends the time in a bar , accompanied by a lady cab driver and her grandson ; earlier in the evening the lady misidentified Rogan as a local small-time hoodlum , and Rogan does not correct her misidentification . They watch the most crucial Game 6 of the World Series playoff between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets . The Sox had won 3 games and could clinch the title by winning Game 6 , but Rogan , a lifelong Sox fan , knows how easily they can lose when they should win . He spends the evening waiting for the inevitable , even though the Sox are ahead most of the time . When the inevitable does occur ( due to an unexpected pair of errors at the end of the final inning ) , he snaps , and heads out to take out his rage on the newspaper critic . He not only finds the critic , but finds him in the early stages of deflowering the playwright s daughter . He begins firing wildly , but is finally calmed when he learns that the critic is equally devastated by the Sox s loss . They end up together , watching an interminable rerun of the final error on a small television set in the critic s apartment .

"Ex-fighter pilot and taxi driver Ted Striker ( Robert Hays ) became traumatized during an unnamed war , leading to a pathological fear of flying . As a result , he is unable to hold a responsible job . His wartime girlfriend , Elaine Dickinson ( Julie Hagerty ) , now a flight attendant , leaves him . Striker nervously boards a Boeing 707 ( Trans American Flight 209 ) from Los Angeles to Chicago on which she is serving , hoping to win her back , but she rebuffs him . After dinner is served , many of the passengers fall ill , and fellow passenger Dr. Rumack ( Leslie Nielsen ) deduces that the passengers have contracted food poisoning from the fish . The cockpit crew , including pilot Clarence Oveur ( Peter Graves ) and co-pilot Roger Murdock ( Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ) , have also been affected , leaving no one to fly the plane . Elaine contacts the Chicago control tower for help , and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey ( Lloyd Bridges ) to activate the plane s autopilot , a large inflatable pilot doll ( listed as Otto in the end credits ) , which will get them to Chicago , but will not be able to land the plane . Rumack convinces Striker to fly the plane , though Striker feels unable to handle the pressure and the unfamiliar aircraft . McCroskey knows that he must get someone else to help take the plane down and calls Rex Kramer ( Robert Stack ) , Striker s commanding officer in the war . Despite their hostile relationship , he is the best choice to instruct Striker . As the plane nears Chicago , Striker is overcome by stress and manages to land the plane only after a pep talk from Dr. Rumack .

The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes tend to point out social injustices , such as a king s betrayal of an opera singer , a stepfather s deception of his ward as a fictitious lover , an aristocratic crook s exploitation of a failing pawnbroker , a beggar s extensive estate in Kent . It suggests that , in contrast , Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of official incompetence and aristocratic privilege . The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes contains many of Doyle s favourite Sherlock Holmes stories . In 1927 , he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories to The Strand Magazine . Among those he listed were The Adventure of the Speckled Band ( as his favourite ) , The Red-Headed League ( second ) , A Scandal in Bohemia ( fifth ) and The Five Orange Pips ( seventh ) .

"Several residents of a Paris boarding-house write letters to their friends and family back home ; their primary subject is their reaction to each other . The main character is Miranda Hope , an angular but likeable Yankee Miss from Bangor , Maine who , quite bravely for a young woman of that era , is traveling in Europe alone . In her letters , she chatters to her mother about seeing the sights in Europe but does n't like the Old World s treatment of its women , and that is a point , you know , on which I feel very strongly . Her expressions of petulance with William Platt , who we realize must have been a suitor of hers back in Maine , are so offhand as to be amusing . Although she is in general the least affected and most sympathetic character in the story , her unawareness of the disdain in which most of the characters hold each other ( including herself ) makes her seem somewhat naive . Meanwhile , society girl Violet Ray of New York writes to a friend that Miranda , who she sees as provincial , is really too horrible . Another boarder , wannabe aesthete Louis Leverett ( quite possibly a self-satire by James ) gushes in his letter that the great thing is to live , you know , amid much precious verbiage about the good , the true and the bee-a-u-tiful . An English boarder , Evelyn Vane , pens a scoffing note that Louis is always talking about the color of the sky , but she doubts if he s ever seen it except through a window-pane ; and the German sees Leverett s decadence as further evidence that the English-speaking world is weak and ripe for takeover . The Frenchman Leon Verdier almost drools in his letter about the charms of ces demoiselles among the boarders , and focuses primarily on their appearance . The rather threatening German professor is the only character both cynical and intelligent enough to realize how disdainful all the English speakers are of each other .

In her letters , she chatters to her mother about seeing the sights in Europe but does n't like the Old World s treatment of its women , and that is a point , you know , on which I feel very strongly . Her expressions of petulance with William Platt , who we realize must have been a suitor of hers back in Maine , are so offhand as to be amusing . Although she is in general the least affected and most sympathetic character in the story , her unawareness of the disdain in which most of the characters hold each other ( including herself ) makes her seem somewhat naive . Meanwhile , society girl Violet Ray of New York writes to a friend that Miranda , who she sees as provincial , is really too horrible . Another boarder , wannabe aesthete Louis Leverett ( quite possibly a self-satire by James ) gushes in his letter that the great thing is to live , you know , amid much precious verbiage about the good , the true and the bee-a-u-tiful .

"Holmes and Dr. Watson find themselves in Cornwall one spring for the formerâs health , but the holiday ends with a bizarre event . Mr. Mortimer Tregennis , a local gentleman , and Mr. Roundhay , the local vicar , come to Holmes to report that Tregennisâs two brothers have gone insane , and his sister has died . Tregennis had gone to visit them in their village ( Tredannick Wollas ) , played whist with them , and then left .

Middle-class professionals are distrusted , and the statement do n't buy from Jews causes much anxiety among Jewish people . It is reasonable to assume that the Jews will not be left in peace . Neither a change in the feelings of non-Jews nor a movement to merge into the surrounds of Europe offers much hope to the Jewish people : The Jewish question persists wherever Jews live in appreciable numbers . Wherever it does not exist , it is brought in together with Jewish immigrants . We are naturally drawn into those places where we are not persecuted , and our appearance there gives rise to persecution . This is the case , and will inevitably be so , everywhere , even in highly civilised countries—see , for instance , France—so long as the Jewish question is not solved on the political level . The book concludes : Therefore I believe that a wondrous generation of Jews will spring into existence . The Maccabeans will rise again . Let me repeat once more my opening words : The Jews who wish for a State will have it . We shall live at last as free men on our own soil , and die peacefully in our own homes . The world will be freed by our liberty , enriched by our wealth , magnified by our greatness . And whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare , will react powerfully and beneficially for the good of humanity . Herzl opposed the efforts already made by Zionist groups to settle Jews in Ottoman-controlled Palestine by arguing that important experiments in colonization have been made , though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews .

"The action of Orlando Furioso takes place against the background of the war between the Christian emperor Charlemagne and the Saracen King of Africa , Agramante , who has invaded Europe to avenge the death of his father Traiano . Agramante and his allies â who include Marsilio , the King of Spain , and the boastful warrior Rodomonte â besiege Charlemagne in Paris . Meanwhile , Orlando , Charlemagne s most famous paladin , has been tempted to forget his duty to protect the emperor through his love for the pagan princess Angelica . At the beginning of the poem , Angelica escapes from the castle of the Bavarian Duke Namo , and Orlando sets off in pursuit . The two meet with various adventures until Angelica saves a wounded Saracen knight , Medoro , falls in love , and elopes with him to Cathay . When Orlando learns the truth , he goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa destroying everything in his path . The English knight Astolfo journeys to Ethiopia on the hippogriff to find a cure for Orlando s madness . He flies up in Elijah s flaming chariot to the moon , where everything lost on earth is to be found , including Orlando s wits . He brings them back in a bottle and makes Orlando sniff them , thus restoring him to sanity . ( At the same time Orlando falls out of love with Angelica , as the author explains that love is itself a form of insanity . ) Orlando joins with Brandimart and Oliver to fight Agramante , Sobrino and Gradasso on the island of Lampedusa . There Orlando kills King Agramante . Another important plotline involves the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero . They too have to endure many vicissitudes . Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress Alcina and has to be freed from her magic island . He also has to avoid the enchantments of his foster father , the wizard Atlante , who does not want him to fight . Finally , Ruggiero converts to Christianity and marries Bradamante . Rodomonte appears at the wedding feast and accuses him of being a traitor to the Saracen cause , and the poem ends with Ruggiero slaying Rodomonte in single combat . Ruggiero and Bradamante are the ancestors of the House of Este , Ariosto s patrons , whose genealogy he gives at length in canto 3 of the poem . The epic contains many other characters , including Orlando s cousin , the paladin Rinaldo , who is also in love with Angelica ; the thief Brunello ; the Saracen FerraĂš ; Sacripante , King of Circassia and a leading Saracen knight ; and the tragic heroine Isabella .

"Dr. Horace Bianchon discovers near the town of Vend么me an abandoned manor : La Grande Bret猫che . Intrigued by the ruins , the doctor tries unsuccessfully to enter the house night after night . Upon returning to the inn where he is staying , he questions the locals about the house . Finally several locals , including a lawyer and the innkeeper , explain the story of the manor . Madame de Merret , the late owner of the manor , forbid anyone from entering the house upon her death , be it workmen , visitors , or government officials , for 50 years . The lawyer was given the task , as well as funds , to ensure that her dying wish be accomplished . Dr. Bianchon learned that Madame de Merret had a Spanish lover for a short period of her life . One day , Madame de Merret s husband returned early from a business trip when her lover was at the house . The lover hid himself in the closet , but the husband , hearing a sound , confronted his wife about the noise . Pressured by her suspicious husband , Madame de Merret swore upon a crucifix that there was no one in the closet , but threatened in turn to leave her husband if he were ever to open the closet out of suspicion . In response , Monsieur de Merret sent for a mason to wall up the closet , trapping the lover inside . Terrified , Madame de Merret passed along a message to the mason asking him to break a hole in the door when her husband was not looking before completely walling the closet off . The mason does that , and Madame de Merret catches a final glimpse of the maddened eyes of her lover through the hole . Once the closet was walled up completely , Madame and Monsieur de Merret stay in the bedroom for several days , listening to the muffled noise coming from the closet .

"While seeking water for his cattle Travis Fox enters a little known canyon in the Arizona desert and gets captured by three men , one of whom he recognizes as Dr. Gordon Ashe , an archaeologist . After discovering that Fox studied archaeology and had done some digging in the very canyon they now occupy , the men have him cleared through security and offer to make him part of their team . Then Ashe tells him that he will be joining an expedition 10,000 years into the past to look for a spaceship . Disguised as Folsom hunters , Fox , Ashe , and Ross Murdock travel into the past to scout out the area around the wreckage of an alien starship , a sphere perhaps 120 feet in diameter . They find the wreck near a lake and then , across a ridge , they find a smaller spaceship intact , its crew of Baldies dead . After receiving the scouts’ report via transtemporal telegraph , Major Kelgarries , the project’s director , and several technicians come into the past and examine the small ship , determining that they can shift it directly into the present . Fox , Ashe , and Murdock serve as roving sentries in the area around the smaller globeship as technicians build a time transfer cage around it . The ash from a volcanic explosion and a stampede of mammoths drive the three men into the ship with Case Renfry , an electronics technician , on the day the transfer is to be made . An earthquake triggers the transfer , bringing the ship into the present , and then the ship’s preset autopilot , jolted into action , takes the ship into space . After carrying the men through hyperspace , the ship lands on a planet where faltering robots refuel the ship . Another leap through hyperspace brings the ship to the second planet of an alien solar system . The ship lands in a desert , sits for a couple of days , and then blasts off on a course that takes it to the system’s Earth-like third planet . Upon landing the ship indicates that the voyage has ended by ejecting a small discus from its autopilot . Renfry attempts to understand the autopilot and to rewind the course tape while the three time agents explore the jungle-draped ruins of a once-great city , in which they’ve landed . After several weeks Renfry believes that he has succeeded and he attempts to launch the ship .

"The play contains a prologue in which the character Machiavel , a Senecan ghost based on NiccolĂ˛ Machiavelli , introduces the tragedy of a Jew . Machiavel expresses the cynical view that power is amoral , saying I count religion but a childish toy , /And hold there is no sin but ignorance . The Jewish merchant in question , Barabas , is introduced as a man owning more wealth than all of Malta . When Turkish ships arrive to demand tribute , however , Barabas s wealth is seized and he is left penniless . Incensed , he begins a campaign to engineer the downfall of the Maltese governor who robbed him . With the aid of his daughter , Abigail , he recovers some of his former assets and buys a Turkish slave , Ithamore , who appears to hate Christians as much as Barabas does . Barabas then , in revenge for the robbery , uses his daughter s beauty to embitter the governor s son ( Lodowick ) and his friend ( Mathias ) against each other , leading to a duel in which they both die . When Abigail learns of Barabas s role in the plot , she consigns herself to a nunnery , only to be poisoned ( along with all of the nuns ) by Barabas and Ithamore for becoming a Christian . The two go on to kill a couple of friars who threaten to divulge their previous crimes . Ithamore himself , however , is lured by a beautiful prostitute and her criminal friend into disclosing his secrets and blackmailing Barabas . Barabas poisons all of them in revenge , but not before the governor is apprised of his deeds .

After fleeing the scene of the crime , White drives Orange to the rendezvous in one of Joe s warehouses . Orange , having been shot during the escape , is severely bleeding out . Pink arrives in an angry mood ; he believes the job was a setup and that the police were waiting for them . White informs him that Brown is dead and that both Blue and Blonde are missing .

After fleeing the scene of the crime , White drives Orange to the rendezvous in one of Joe s warehouses . Orange , having been shot during the escape , is severely bleeding out . Pink arrives in an angry mood ; he believes the job was a setup and that the police were waiting for them . White informs him that Brown is dead and that both Blue and Blonde are missing . He also mentions that Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist . As he and Joe are old friends , White is furious that he would employ such a psychopath . Pink reveals that he has hidden the diamonds nearby , but argues with White over whether or not they should get medical attention for Orange .

"Eight men eat breakfast at a Los Angeles diner before executing their planned diamond heist . Six of them use aliases : Mr. Blonde , Mr. Blue , Mr. Brown , Mr. Orange , Mr . Pink , and Mr. White . The others are mob boss Joe Cabot and his son and underboss , Nice Guy Eddie Cabot , who are responsible for planning the job . After fleeing the scene of the crime , White drives Orange to the rendezvous in one of Joe s warehouses . Orange , having been shot during the escape , is severely bleeding out . Pink arrives in an angry mood ; he believes the job was a setup and that the police were waiting for them . White informs him that Brown is dead and that both Blue and Blonde are missing . He also mentions that Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist . As he and Joe are old friends , White is furious that he would employ such a psychopath . Pink reveals that he has hidden the diamonds nearby , but argues with White over whether or not they should get medical attention for Orange . Blonde arrives and tells the others that Eddie is en route to meet them . He then brings out a kidnapped policeman , Marvin Nash , and has White and Pink beat him for information about who set them up . Eddie arrives and orders them to retrieve the diamonds and ditch the getaway vehicles , leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange . Nash denies knowing anything , but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture , cutting off his right ear with a straight razor . He then tries to set Nash on fire , but is subsequently shot dead by Orange . Orange explains that he is really an undercover police officer and that the police have been tracking him . When Eddie , Pink , and White return , Orange tries to convince them that Blonde planned to kill them and steal the diamonds for himself . After finishing off Nash , Eddie accuses him of lying , since Blonde was loyal to his father . Joe then arrives with news that the police have found and killed Blue . Having found proof of Orange s true loyalties , he moves to execute him , but White intervenes and holds him at gunpoint . Eddie in turn points his own weapon at White , creating a Mexican standoff .

"During a train ride , Pozdnyshev overhears a conversation concerning marriage , divorce and love . When a woman argues that marriage should not be arranged but based on true love , he asks what is love ? and points out that , if understood as an exclusive preference for one person , it often passes quickly . Convention dictates that two married people stay together , and initial love can quickly turn into hatred . He then relates how he used to visit prostitutes when he was young , and complains that women s dresses are designed to arouse men s desires . He further states that women will never enjoy equal rights to men as long as men view them as objects of desire , yet describes their situation as a form of power over men , mentioning how much of society is geared towards their pleasure and well-being and how much sway they have over men s actions .
