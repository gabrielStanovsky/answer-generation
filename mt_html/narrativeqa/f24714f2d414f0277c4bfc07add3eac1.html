	<h5>
		In this task, you are given a passage, a question, a correct answer, and a predicted answer.
		The task is to <font color="#FF0000"><em>score how closely a predicted answer captures the same information (i.e. have the same meaning) as a correct answer</em></font> using the <em><strong><u>passage</u></strong></em>, <em><strong><u>question</u></strong></em>, and human <em><strong><u>commonsense knowledge</u></strong></em>. 
		<br /> <br /> 
		Scoring is on a scale <font color="#FF0000"><em> from 1 to 5 </em></font>. 
		<br />
		A <font color="#FF0000"><em>1</em></font> score means the predicted answer captures none of the information of the correct answer, and thus is a completely wrong answer.
		<br /> 
		A <font color="#FF0000"><em>5</em></font> score means the predicted answer captures the same information as the correct answer, and thus is a completely right answer.<br />

		<!-- Each HIT will contain multiple questions and predictions for the same context so it needs to only be read once per HIT. -->
		<br /> 

		<br /><br />
		<u>Note:</u> A predicted answer may answer the question correctly, but to be given a score of 5, <font color="#FF0000;"><b>it must be equivalent to the correct answer</b></font>. An example is provided below of this case. <br/><br/>
		<u>Note:</u> The score you give should not depend on the capitalization of the correct and predicted answer.<br/><br/>
		<u>Note:</u> A helpful tip for searching for the correct answer in the passage is using Control+F to search for it.<br/><br/>

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Completely Right)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">5</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		Some ways a predicted answer can get a score of 5.

		<ul>
			<li> It is clear that that the predicted and correct answers refer to the same person, place, or object.</li>
			<li> The predicted and correct answers are synonyms. </li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;He goes to prison to serve out a five years' sentence, but after three years have passed is pardoned out through the efforts of Maria Wyndham, Mr. Fletcher's granddaughter, whom he has loved for years&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What is the relationship of Maria Wyndham to Mr. Fletcher? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> grandaughter<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Maria is Mr. Fletcher's granddaughter. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer captures the same information as the correct answer when taking into account the passage and question. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;The next day, two men, John and Jim (who are drug dealers), arrive at the apartment to pick up the package&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who comes to pick up the package the next day ? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Drug Dealers  <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Jim and John <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> In this case, John and Jim are the drug dealers so this is completely correct. More generally, if the correct answer and the predicted answer both refer to the same <strong>entity</strong>, then the predicted answer is correct, even if it is written differently.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;Later, Tom and three other boys combine their money to buy a boat named Dolphin and sneak away to an island&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Tom and three other friends put their money together to buy what?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A boat<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> A boat named Dolphin <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> Similar to above, since "a boat named Dolphin" and "a boat" both refer to the same entity.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;Thrilling things happen at Monte Carlo&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What kind of things happen in Monte Carlo?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> In Monte Carlo thrilling things happen.<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Fun and exciting.<br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> Fun and exciting is synonymous with "thrilling", and so we give this a <strong>5</strong>. More generally, it is important to look out for synonyms when scoring answers.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Mr Hillard hears from his window on a night of fog and mist a young woman's voice singing divinely. Later on, Mr. Hillard again meets the young, adventurous singer under most mystifying circumstances. They dine together in New York&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who does Mr. Hillard dine with in New York?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> The Singer. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The lady from the window of the hotel in New York. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> Similar to above, "the singer" and "the lady from the window" refer to the same person.<br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Mostly Right)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">4</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		A score of 4 means that there is a minor detail wrong with the predicted answer, but otherwise, is a perfect answer. Some ways a predicted answer can get a score of 4.
		<ul>
			<li> The predicted answer is a little ungrammatical.</li>
			<li> The predicted answer is a <strong>little</strong> unspecific (e.g. the correct answer is the city but the predicted answer is the country of the city).</li>
			<li> The predicted answer gets the gender wrong (e.g. he vs she, him vs her).</li>
			<li> The predicted answer gets the plurality wrong (e.g. he vs they, policeman vs policemen).</li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;The next day, two men, John and Jim (who are drug dealers), arrive at the apartment to pick up the package&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who comes to pick up the package the next day ?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Drug Dealers<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> the drug drug dealers <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> This answer is mostly correct, but a little ungrammatical with the extra "drug". Cases where the predicted answer is understandable and correct but a little ungrammatical should receive a <strong>4</strong>. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;The enamoured Sibyl calls him "Prince Charming", and swoons with the happiness of being loved, but her protective brother, James warns that if "Prince Charming" harms her, he will murder Dorian Gray&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> How is James related to Sibyl?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong>  He is her brother<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> He is his brother<br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer is mostly correct. However, "her" is changed to "his" (meaning Sibyl is male), making the answer slighly incorrect. In general, if a pronoun is the wrong gender, then you can deduct a point. For example, a sister is referenced as a "he".<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> In Tom's boyhood, his father wants his to be educated in the North and sent him back to Rivermouth to live with his grandfather.<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Where does Tom's dad send him to study? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Rivermouth  <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The North <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> In the passage, Rivermouth is a city in the North, but the North is a fairly large area and Rivermouth is more specific, so we will say this is mostly correct. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Mr. Hillard hears from his window a woman's voice singing divinely. He runs down but by the time her reaches the street she has vanished and only a policeman remains&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who is the only person on the street when Hillard finally makes it down? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A policeman is the only one there. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The police <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> Policeman is singular while "the police" generally evokes the imagery of multiple policemen. Therefore we say this prediction is mostly correct but not completely correct. <br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Half Right)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">3</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		Some ways a predicted answer can get a score of 3.
		<ul>
			<li> The prediction gets half of the details right (see example 1). </li>
			<li> The prediction gets the details right, but is quite unspecific (see example 2) </li>
			<li> The correct answer is a list but the prediction only gets some of the elements of the list.</li>
			<li> The correct answer is a single item (person, object, etc) but the prediction adds some extra items.</li>
			<li> The predicted answer gets the first name right but the last name wrong (or vice versa).</li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;Then the scene shifts to Italy, with the shifting fortunes of an American comic opera company, stranded at Venice. The beautiful singer becomes the prima donna of this company. The soubrette is one Kitty Killigrew&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong>  Who is Kitty Killigrew?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong>  The soubrette of the American Opera Company.<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The singer of the Italian comic opera company, the soubrette. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer gets the fact that Kitty is a singer (a soubrette) of an opera company correct. However, it says that the company is Italian, which is wrong. We therefore consider this answer half correct. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Charity has been feeling unwell, so she and Bethany go to Dr. Merkle, who confirms her suspicion that she is pregnant&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Which suspicion does Dr. Merkel confirm?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> That Charity is pregnant.<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> That she is pregnant <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> In the predicted answer "she" is undefined. It could be Charity, Dr. Merkle, or Bethany. Because we do not know who "she" is, we cannot say this answer is completely correct. The predicted answer does mention the pregnancy, so we will say this is half correct. More generally, if a predicted answer has some ambuiguity, it cannot be completely correct.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage: </strong> &hellip;They watch the most crucial Game 6 of the World Series playoff between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets.&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong>Who was playing in the World Series? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Red Sox and the Mets<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Red Sox <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> In cases where the correct answer is a list of <strong>nouns</strong> and the prediction only has a part of the list, we generally give it a <strong>3</strong>. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip; During the winter, several boys build a snow fort on Slatter's Hill, inciting rival boys into a battle of snowballs &hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What do the boys do in winter? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> They build a fort on Slatter's Hill. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> They create a sun castle on Slatter's Hill.<br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer gets the location correct (Slater's Hill). However <em>what</em> is build is equally important and the predicted answer says "sun castle", which is nonsensical. <br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Mostly Wrong)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">2</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		A score of 2 means that the predicted answer is incorrect, but there is some slight redeemable quality to it.
		<ul>
			<li> The predicted answer is clearly wrong, but there is some word overlap between the correct and predicted answer that makes it seem slighly correct and the predicted answer is grammatical. (See example 1) </li>
			<li> The prediction gets one thing correct, but more than one thing wrong. (See example 2)</li>
			<li> The predicted gets a detail wrong that significantly affects the meaning, but still gets some minor details correct.</li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> "Tom Bailey" is born in the fictitious town of Rivermouth, New Hampshire, but moves to New Orleans with his family when he is 18 months old.&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> How old was Tom Bailey when he moves from New Hampshire to New Orleans? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 18 months old<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 18 <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer makes it seem like Tom is 18 <em>years old </em> which is completely wrong. However, because the predicted and correct answer both have "18", which is meaningful, we will give it a <strong>2</strong> instead of a <strong>1</strong>. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> In Tom's boyhood, his father wants his to be educated in the North and sent him back to Rivermouth to live with his grandfather, Captain Nutter.<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who does Tom live with up north?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> His grandfather, Captain Nutter. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> His grandmother, Captain William Nutter. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> This prediction gets two things wrong. It first makes Captain Nutter a female. It then adds a first name (William) which we do not know to be true. It does get the last name correct, so we will say this answer is not completely wrong and give it a <strong>2</strong>.<br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Completely Wrong)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">1</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		There are a number of ways a predicted answer can get a score of 1.
		<ul>
			<li> <strong>TRICKY!!!</strong> A predicted answer can technically be a correct answer to the question, but if it does not have the same meaning as the correct answer, it is a score of 1 for this task. (see example 1) </li>
			<li> The predicted doesn't make any sense or is very ungrammatical.</li>
			<li> The answer gets all details wrong (e..g the name(s) are completely wrong, places are completely wrong, etc). </li>
			<li> The predicted answer is opposite of the correct answer (e.g. yes vs no, hot vs cold, etc.)
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Mr. Hillard hears from his window a woman's voice singing divinely. He falls in love with it and falls down the stairs running to her. But by the time her reaches the street she has vanished.<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What happens when Hillard hurries to find the singer? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> He falls down the stairs. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> She vanished. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> While "she vanished" is technically a correct answer to the question, for a predicted answer to be "right" in this task, it must also be EQUIVALENT (have the same meaning) to the correct answer. "Mr Hillard falling" is a completely different from "the singer vanishing". We therefore score the predicted answer <strong>1</strong>.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;He goes to prison to serve out a five years' sentence, but after three years have passed is pardoned out through the efforts of Maria Wyndham, Mr. Fletcher's granddaughter, whom he has loved for years&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What is the relationship of Maria Wyndham to Mr. Fletcher? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> grandaughter <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> maria is maria 's granddaughter  <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> While the "granddaughter" is present in the predicted answer, the rest is completely nonsensical as someone cannot be their own grandmother. For nonsensical answers, we assign a score of <strong>1</strong>, even if there is word overlap between the predicted answer and the correct answer. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;The next day, two men, John and Jim (who are drug dealers), arrive at the apartment to pick up the package. Peter and Michael mistakenly give Mary to them instead, and shortly after they leave, Peter discovers the actual package&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who comes to pick up the package the next day ? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Drug Dealers  <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Peter and Michael <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The drug dealers are John and Jim. The predicted answer gets the names of the drug dealers completely wrong.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> A young New Yorker, Mr. Hillard, hears from his window on a night of fog and mist a woman's voice singing divinely&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What does Hillard hear through his window? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> He hears a woman's beautiful singing. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> he hears a beautiful single girl's Lady <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> This predicted answer doesn't make sense, and so we assign it a <strong>1</strong>. <br />
		</div><br />

			<h4><strong>Part 1. Read the following passage: </strong></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">The plot concerns the children of the Duke of Omnium, Plantagenet Palliser, and his late wife, Lady Glencora. When Lady Glencora dies unexpectedly, the Duke is left to deal with his grownup children, with whom he has a somewhat distant relationship. As the government in which he is Prime Minister has also fallen, the Duke is left bereft of both his beloved wife and his political position. Before her death, Lady Glencora had imprudently given her secret blessing to her daughter Mary's courtship by a poor gentleman, Frank Tregear, a friend of Lord Silverbridge, the Duke's older son and heir. Mrs. Finn, Lady Glencora's dearest confidante, somewhat uneasily remains after the funeral as a companion and unofficial chaperone for Mary at the Duke's request. Once she becomes aware of the seriousness of the relationship between Mary and Frank, Mrs. Finn insists that the Duke be informed. The Duke's two sons also prove burdensome. Lord Silverbridge follows the wishes of his father by entering Parliament. He had proposed to Lady Mabel Grex, whom he has known all his life. She turned him down, although with an indication of a more welcoming answer another time. However, Lord Silverbridge becomes enamoured with American heiress Isabel Boncassen. She agrees to marry him, but only if the Duke is willing to welcome her into the family. At first, the Duke disapproves; and he disapproves even more of his daughter's suitor. To add to his troubles, Gerald, the younger son, gets himself expelled from Cambridge after attending the Derby without permission. However, by the end of the book, the Duke grows closer to all three of his children; he allows the engagements of both son and daughter, and he is invited once more to take a part in the government.</p>
