<div class="content">
<h5>In this task, you are given a passage, a question, a correct answer, and a predicted answer.
    The task is to <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>score how closely a predicted answer captures the same information as a correct answer</em></span> using the <em><strong><u>passage</u></strong></em>, <em><strong><u>question</u></strong></em>, and human <em><strong><u>commonsense knowledge</u></strong></em>. 
    <br /> <br /> 
    Scoring is on a scale <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em> from 1 to 5 </em></span>. 
    <br />
    A score of <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>1</em></span> means the predicted answer captures none of the information of the correct answer, and thus is a completely wrong answer.
    <br /> 
    A score of <span style="color:#FF0000;"><em>5</em></span> means the predicted answer captures the same information as the correct answer, and thus is a completely right answer.<br /> <br /> 

    Each HIT will contain multiple questions and predictions for the same context so it needs to only be read once per HIT.<br /> 


    <br /><br />
    <u>Note:</u> A predicted answer may be a correct answer, but to be given a score of 5, it must be equivalent to the correct answer. An example is provided below of this case. <br/><br/>
    <u>Note:</u> The score you give should not depend on the capitalization of the correct and predicted answer.<br/><br/>
    <u>Note:</u> A helpful tip for searching for the correct answer in the passage is using Control+F to search for it.<br/><br/>

    <strong><u>Passage:</u></strong> &hellip;He goes to prison to serve out a five years' sentence, but after three years have passed is pardoned out through the efforts of Maria Wyndham, Mr. Fletcher's granddaughter, whom he has loved for years.&hellip; <br />
    <strong><u>Question:</u></strong> What is the relationship of Maria Wyndham to Mr. Fletcher? <br />
    <strong><u>Correct Answer:</u></strong> grandaughter <br /><br />
        
        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <strong><u>Predicted Answer:</u></strong> Maria is Mr. Fletcher's granddaughter. <br />
            <strong><u>Score:</u></strong>  5 <br />
            <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> The predicted answer captures the same information as the correct answer when taking into account the passage and question. <br />
        </div><br />

        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <strong><u>Predicted Answer:</u></strong> maria is maria 's granddaughter <br />
            <strong><u>Score:</u></strong>  1 <br />
            <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> While the prediction has the word granddaughter, it has additional information that makes it nonsensical (one cannnot be their own granddaughter).<br />
        </div><br />

    <strong><u>Passage:</u></strong> &hellip;On the way she sees the minister, Mr. Miles, and her friend Liff Hyatt. They are on their way to the mountain because Charity’s mother is dying. When they arrive, Charity’s mother is already dead, and the three of them bury her.&hellip; <br />
    <strong><u>Question:</u></strong> What happened to Charity's mother? <br />
    <strong><u>Correct Answer:</u></strong> Charity's mother dies. <br /><br />
        
        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <strong><u>Predicted Answer:</u></strong> She dies. <br />
            <strong><u>Score:</u></strong>  5 <br />
            <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> The predicted answer captures the same information as the correct answer when taking into account the passage and question. <br />
        </div><br />

        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <strong><u>Predicted Answer:</u></strong> she is dying <br />
            <strong><u>Score:</u></strong>  3 <br />
            <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> While this is technically a correct answer, it is not exactly the same as the correct answer. However, it is not completely different from the correct answer. <br />
        </div><br />

    <strong><u>Passage:</u></strong> &hellip;The next day, two men, John and Jim (who are drug dealers), arrive at the apartment to pick up the package. Peter and Michael mistakenly give Mary to them instead, and shortly after they leave, Peter discovers the actual package.&hellip; <br />
    <strong><u>Question:</u></strong> Who comes to pick up the package the next day ? <br />
    <strong><u>Correct Answer:</u></strong> Drug Dealers <br /><br />

        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <strong><u>Predicted Answer:</u></strong> two men <br />
            <strong><u>Score:</u></strong>  4 <br />
            <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> In the passage, the two men are the same people as the drug dealers. However, two men could be any two people (for example, Peter and Michael), so we will say that it isn't completely equivalent. <br />
        </div><br />

        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <strong><u>Predicted Answer:</u></strong> the drug drug dealers <br />
            <strong><u>Score:</u></strong>  4 <br />
            <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> The predicted answer is correct, though slightly ungrammatical, so we give it a 4. <br />
        </div><br />

        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <strong><u>Predicted Answer:</u></strong> John, Jim, and Peter <br />
            <strong><u>Score:</u></strong>  3 <br />
            <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> "John, Jim" would be a 5, however the prediction includes Peter, who is not a drug dealer. We therefore consider this answer half correct. <br />
        </div><br />

        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <strong><u>Predicted Answer:</u></strong> Peter and Michael <br />
            <strong><u>Score:</u></strong>  1 <br />
            <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> Completely wrong names of the drug dealers. <br />

Upon the death of his father, when he is only ten years old, he suddenly finds home and fortune snatched from him, and with a blind mother and two sisters to support he begins a life of toil. He foregoes education and drudges unceasingly that his mother may be kept in ignorance of her change of fortune and that his twin sister may not have to work. After fifteen years of this existence his nature becomes hardened and his heart is filled with hatred for Mr. Fletcher, the past manager of the estate, who is now its possessor. Fletcher, who is a vulgar and ugly tempered man, has gained his possessions by cheating and dishonesty, and Christopher's one though from childhood has been a desire for revenge. He finds his opportunity in leading to ruin Fletcher's grandson, Will, a weak young fellow, who is idolized by his grandfather. Christopher leads him into dissipation and teaches him to despise his grandfather till finally in a moment of drunken frenzy he kills him. Then Christopher realizes the enormity of his sin, aids Will to escape, and takes the punishment. He goes to prison to serve out a five years' sentence, but after three years have passed is pardoned out through the efforts of Maria Wyndham, Fletcher's granddaughter, whom he has loved for years. Maria, who has returned his affection and is now the heir to the estate, is only too glad to restore it to its rightful owner, and the lovers, and their many years of unhappiness, are at least united.</p>
