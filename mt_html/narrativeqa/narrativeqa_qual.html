	<h5>
		In this task, you are given a passage, a question, a correct answer, and a predicted answer.
		The task is to <font color="#FF0000"><em>score how closely a predicted answer captures the same information (i.e. have the same meaning) as a correct answer</em></font> using the <em><strong><u>passage</u></strong></em>, <em><strong><u>question</u></strong></em>, and human <em><strong><u>commonsense knowledge</u></strong></em>. 
		<br /> <br /> 
		Scoring is on a scale <font color="#FF0000"><em> from 1 to 5 </em></font>. 
		<br />
		A <font color="#FF0000"><em>1</em></font> score means the predicted answer captures none of the information of the correct answer, and thus is a completely wrong answer.
		<br /> 
		A <font color="#FF0000"><em>5</em></font> score means the predicted answer captures the same information as the correct answer, and thus is a completely right answer.<br />

		<!-- Each HIT will contain multiple questions and predictions for the same context so it needs to only be read once per HIT. -->
		<br /> 

		<br /><br />
		<u>Note:</u> A predicted answer may answer the question correctly, but to be given a score of 5, <font color="#FF0000;"><b>it must be equivalent to the correct answer</b></font>. An example is provided below of this case. <br/><br/>
		<u>Note:</u> The score you give should not depend on the capitalization of the correct and predicted answer.<br/><br/>
		<u>Note:</u> A helpful tip for searching for the correct answer in the passage is using Control+F to search for it.<br/><br/>

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Completely Right)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">5</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		Some ways a predicted answer can get a score of 5.

		<ul>
			<li> It is clear that that the predicted and correct answers refer to the same person, place, or object.</li>
			<li> The predicted and correct answers are synonyms. </li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;He goes to prison to serve out a five years' sentence, but after three years have passed is pardoned out through the efforts of Maria Wyndham, Mr. Fletcher's granddaughter, whom he has loved for years&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What is the relationship of Maria Wyndham to Mr. Fletcher? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> grandaughter<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Maria is Mr. Fletcher's granddaughter. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer captures the same information as the correct answer when taking into account the passage and question. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;The next day, two men, John and Jim (who are drug dealers), arrive at the apartment to pick up the package&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who comes to pick up the package the next day ? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Drug Dealers  <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Jim and John <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> In this case, John and Jim are the drug dealers so this is completely correct. More generally, if the correct answer and the predicted answer both refer to the same <strong>entity</strong>, then the predicted answer is correct, even if it is written differently.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;Later, Tom and three other boys combine their money to buy a boat named Dolphin and sneak away to an island&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Tom and three other friends put their money together to buy what?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A boat<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> A boat named Dolphin <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> Similar to above, since "a boat named Dolphin" and "a boat" both refer to the same entity.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;Thrilling things happen at Monte Carlo&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What kind of things happen in Monte Carlo?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> In Monte Carlo thrilling things happen.<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Fun and exciting.<br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> Fun and exciting is synonymous with "thrilling", and so we give this a <strong>5</strong>. More generally, it is important to look out for synonyms when scoring answers.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Mr Hillard hears from his window on a night of fog and mist a young woman's voice singing divinely. Later on, Mr. Hillard again meets the young, adventurous singer under most mystifying circumstances. They dine together in New York&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who does Mr. Hillard dine with in New York?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> The Singer. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The lady from the window of the hotel in New York. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> Similar to above, "the singer" and "the lady from the window" refer to the same person.<br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Mostly Right)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">4</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		A score of 4 means that there is a minor detail wrong with the predicted answer, but otherwise, is a perfect answer. Some ways a predicted answer can get a score of 4.
		<ul>
			<li> The predicted answer is a little ungrammatical.</li>
			<li> The predicted answer is a <strong>little</strong> unspecific (e.g. the correct answer is the city but the predicted answer is the country of the city).</li>
			<li> The predicted answer gets the gender wrong (e.g. he vs she, him vs her).</li>
			<li> The predicted answer gets the plurality wrong (e.g. he vs they, policeman vs policemen).</li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;The next day, two men, John and Jim (who are drug dealers), arrive at the apartment to pick up the package&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who comes to pick up the package the next day ?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Drug Dealers<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> the drug drug dealers <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> This answer is mostly correct, but a little ungrammatical with the extra "drug". Cases where the predicted answer is understandable and correct but a little ungrammatical should receive a <strong>4</strong>. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;The enamoured Sibyl calls him "Prince Charming", and swoons with the happiness of being loved, but her protective brother, James warns that if "Prince Charming" harms her, he will murder Dorian Gray&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> How is James related to Sibyl?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong>  He is her brother<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> He is his brother<br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer is mostly correct. However, "her" is changed to "his" (meaning Sibyl is male), making the answer slighly incorrect. In general, if a pronoun is the wrong gender, then you can deduct a point. For example, a sister is referenced as a "he".<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> In Tom's boyhood, his father wants his to be educated in the North and sent him back to Rivermouth to live with his grandfather.<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Where does Tom's dad send him to study? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Rivermouth  <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The North <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> In the passage, Rivermouth is a city in the North, but the North is a fairly large area and Rivermouth is more specific, so we will say this is mostly correct. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Mr. Hillard hears from his window a woman's voice singing divinely. He runs down but by the time her reaches the street she has vanished and only a policeman remains&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who is the only person on the street when Hillard finally makes it down? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A policeman is the only one there. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The police <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> Policeman is singular while "the police" generally evokes the imagery of multiple policemen. Therefore we say this prediction is mostly correct but not completely correct. <br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Half Right)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">3</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		Some ways a predicted answer can get a score of 3.
		<ul>
			<li> The prediction gets half of the details right (see example 1). </li>
			<li> The prediction gets the details right, but is quite unspecific (see example 2) </li>
			<li> The correct answer is a list but the prediction only gets some of the elements of the list.</li>
			<li> The correct answer is a single item (person, object, etc) but the prediction adds some extra items.</li>
			<li> The predicted answer gets the first name right but the last name wrong (or vice versa).</li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;Then the scene shifts to Italy, with the shifting fortunes of an American comic opera company, stranded at Venice. The beautiful singer becomes the prima donna of this company. The soubrette is one Kitty Killigrew&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong>  Who is Kitty Killigrew?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong>  The soubrette of the American Opera Company.<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The singer of the Italian comic opera company, the soubrette. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer gets the fact that Kitty is a singer (a soubrette) of an opera company correct. However, it says that the company is Italian, which is wrong. We therefore consider this answer half correct. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Charity has been feeling unwell, so she and Bethany go to Dr. Merkle, who confirms her suspicion that she is pregnant&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Which suspicion does Dr. Merkel confirm?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> That Charity is pregnant.<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> That she is pregnant <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> In the predicted answer "she" is undefined. It could be Charity, Dr. Merkle, or Bethany. Because we do not know who "she" is, we cannot say this answer is completely correct. The predicted answer does mention the pregnancy, so we will say this is half correct. More generally, if a predicted answer has some ambuiguity, it cannot be completely correct.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage: </strong> &hellip;They watch the most crucial Game 6 of the World Series playoff between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets.&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong>Who was playing in the World Series? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Red Sox and the Mets<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Red Sox <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> In cases where the correct answer is a list of <strong>nouns</strong> and the prediction only has a part of the list, we generally give it a <strong>3</strong>. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip; During the winter, several boys build a snow fort on Slatter's Hill, inciting rival boys into a battle of snowballs &hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What do the boys do in winter? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> They build a fort on Slatter's Hill. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> They create a sun castle on Slatter's Hill.<br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer gets the location correct (Slater's Hill). However <em>what</em> is build is equally important and the predicted answer says "sun castle", which is nonsensical. <br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Mostly Wrong)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">2</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		A score of 2 means that the predicted answer is incorrect, but there is some slight redeemable quality to it.
		<ul>
			<li> The predicted answer is clearly wrong, but there is some word overlap between the correct and predicted answer that makes it seem slighly correct and the predicted answer is grammatical. (See example 1) </li>
			<li> The prediction gets one thing correct, but more than one thing wrong. (See example 2)</li>
			<li> The predicted gets a detail wrong that significantly affects the meaning, but still gets some minor details correct.</li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> "Tom Bailey" is born in the fictitious town of Rivermouth, New Hampshire, but moves to New Orleans with his family when he is 18 months old.&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> How old was Tom Bailey when he moves from New Hampshire to New Orleans? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 18 months old<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 18 <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer makes it seem like Tom is 18 <em>years old </em> which is completely wrong. However, because the predicted and correct answer both have "18", which is meaningful, we will give it a <strong>2</strong> instead of a <strong>1</strong>. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> In Tom's boyhood, his father wants his to be educated in the North and sent him back to Rivermouth to live with his grandfather, Captain Nutter.<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who does Tom live with up north?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> His grandfather, Captain Nutter. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> His grandmother, Captain William Nutter. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> This prediction gets two things wrong. It first makes Captain Nutter a female. It then adds a first name (William) which we do not know to be true. It does get the last name correct, so we will say this answer is not completely wrong and give it a <strong>2</strong>.<br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Completely Wrong)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">1</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		There are a number of ways a predicted answer can get a score of 1.
		<ul>
			<li> <strong>TRICKY!!!</strong> A predicted answer can technically be a correct answer to the question, but if it does not have the same meaning as the correct answer, it is a score of 1 for this task. (see example 1) </li>
			<li> The predicted doesn't make any sense or is very ungrammatical.</li>
			<li> The answer gets all details wrong (e..g the name(s) are completely wrong, places are completely wrong, etc). </li>
			<li> The predicted answer is opposite of the correct answer (e.g. yes vs no, hot vs cold, etc.)
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Mr. Hillard hears from his window a woman's voice singing divinely. He falls in love with it and falls down the stairs running to her. But by the time her reaches the street she has vanished.<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What happens when Hillard hurries to find the singer? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> He falls down the stairs. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> She vanished. <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> While "she vanished" is technically a correct answer to the question, for a predicted answer to be "right" in this task, it must also be EQUIVALENT (have the same meaning) to the correct answer. "Mr Hillard falling" is a completely different from "the singer vanishing". We therefore score the predicted answer <strong>1</strong>.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;He goes to prison to serve out a five years' sentence, but after three years have passed is pardoned out through the efforts of Maria Wyndham, Mr. Fletcher's granddaughter, whom he has loved for years&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What is the relationship of Maria Wyndham to Mr. Fletcher? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> grandaughter <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> maria is maria 's granddaughter  <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> While the "granddaughter" is present in the predicted answer, the rest is completely nonsensical as someone cannot be their own grandmother. For nonsensical answers, we assign a score of <strong>1</strong>, even if there is word overlap between the predicted answer and the correct answer. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;The next day, two men, John and Jim (who are drug dealers), arrive at the apartment to pick up the package. Peter and Michael mistakenly give Mary to them instead, and shortly after they leave, Peter discovers the actual package&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who comes to pick up the package the next day ? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Drug Dealers  <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Peter and Michael <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The drug dealers are John and Jim. The predicted answer gets the names of the drug dealers completely wrong.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> A young New Yorker, Mr. Hillard, hears from his window on a night of fog and mist a woman's voice singing divinely&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What does Hillard hear through his window? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> He hears a woman's beautiful singing. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> he hears a beautiful single girl's Lady <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> This predicted answer doesn't make sense, and so we assign it a <strong>1</strong>. <br />

			<h4><strong>Part 1. Read the following passage: </strong></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">Bateman breaks off his engagement with Evelyn. That night, as he uses an ATM, he finds a stray kitten; the ATM displays the text "feed me a stray cat". As he prepares to shoot the cat, a woman sees him and tries to stop him; he shoots her and lets the cat go free. A police chase ensues, but Bateman destroys the police cars by shooting their gas tanks. Fleeing to his office, Bateman enters the wrong office building, where he murders a security guard and a janitor. In his office, Bateman calls his lawyer Harold and frantically leaves a lengthy confession on Harold's answering machine. The following morning, Bateman visits Paul's apartment, expecting it to be full of decomposing bodies and in the middle of a police investigation, but it is vacant and for sale. The real estate broker tells him to leave. As Bateman goes to meet with his colleagues and lawyer for lunch, Jean finds detailed drawings of murder, mutilation, and rape in Bateman's office journal to her disgust and sympathy. Bateman sees Harold at a restaurant and tries to convince him that he is a serial killer relating to the phone message he left the other night. Harold mistakes Patrick for another colleague and laughs off the phone message confession as a joke, saying he had dinner with Paul in London days earlier. A confused Bateman returns to his friends and in a final voice-over narration, he realizes he will continue to escape the punishment he deserves, that there has been no catharsis, and that his confession has meant nothing.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone, pursued by the marauders. Wez manages to board the truck and attack Max, but a head-on collision with Humungus's car kills both Wez and Humungus. Max loses control of the tanker and it rolls off the road. As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he sees not petrol, but sand, leaking from the tank. The truck and its trailer are thus exposed as a decoy, allowing the other settlers to escape with the precious fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles. With Pappagallo dead, the Gyro Captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast, where they establish the "Great Northern Tribe". Max remains alone in the desert, once again becoming a drifter. Years later, the Feral Kid, now the Northern Tribe's new leader (voice by Harold Baigent), reminisces about the legend of the mythical "Road Warrior" (Max) who now exists only in distant memory.</p>

			<h4><strong>Part 1. Read the following passage: </strong></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">A synopsis of the book published in 1910 states: This is a romance of the Virginia tobacco fields and has for its central figure Christopher Blake. He is the descendant of a rich and aristocratic family, and through reduced fortunes is obligated to work as a laborer on the estate which for generations has been owned by his forbears. Upon the death of his father, when he is only ten years old, he suddenly finds home and fortune snatched from him, and with a blind mother and two sisters to support he begins a life of toil. He foregoes education and drudges unceasingly that his mother may be kept in ignorance of her change of fortune and that his twin sister may not have to work. After fifteen years of this existence his nature becomes hardened and his heart is filled with hatred for Mr. Fletcher, the past manager of the estate, who is now its possessor. Fletcher, who is a vulgar and ugly tempered man, has gained his possessions by cheating and dishonesty, and Christopher's one though from childhood has been a desire for revenge. He finds his opportunity in leading to ruin Fletcher's grandson, Will, a weak young fellow, who is idolized by his grandfather. Christopher leads him into dissipation and teaches him to despise his grandfather till finally in a moment of drunken frenzy he kills him. Then Christopher realizes the enormity of his sin, aids Will to escape, and takes the punishment. He goes to prison to serve out a five years' sentence, but after three years have passed is pardoned out through the efforts of Maria Wyndham, Fletcher's granddaughter, whom he has loved for years. Maria, who has returned his affection and is now the heir to the estate, is only too glad to restore it to its rightful owner, and the lovers, and their many years of unhappiness, are at least united.</p>

			<h4><strong>Part 1. Read the following passage: </strong></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">Almayer’s Folly is about a poor businessman who dreams of finding a hidden gold mine and becoming very wealthy. He is a white European, married to a native Malayan; they have one daughter named Nina. He fails to find the goldmine, and comes home saddened. Previously, he had heard that the British were to conquer the Pantai River, and he had built a large, lavish house near where he resided at the time, in order to welcome the invading country to the native land. However, the conquest never took place, and the house remained unfinished. Some passing Dutch seamen had called the house “Almayer’s Folly”. Now, Almayer continually goes out for long trips, but eventually he stops doing so and stays home with his hopeless daydreams of riches and splendor. His native wife loathes him for this. One day, a Malayan prince, Dain Maroola, came to see Almayer about trading, and while there he falls in love with Nina. Mrs. Almayer kept arranging meetings for Nina and Dain. She wanted them to marry so her daughter could stay native, because she was highly distrustful of the white men and their ways. Dain left but vowed to return to help Almayer find the gold mine. When he does return, he goes straight to Lakamba, a Malayan rajah, and told him that he found the gold mine and that some Dutchmen had captured his ship. The rajah tells him to kill Almayer before the Dutch arrive because he is not needed to find the gold now. </p>

			<h4><strong>Part 1. Read the following passage: </strong></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">A 1908 review of the book summarizes the light plot of the story in overenthusiastic fashion: The story opens with a jump--literally. A young New Yorker, rich, of course, hears from his window on a night of fog and mist a woman's voice singing divinely. He falls in love with it head over heels and he falls downstairs in about the same way, he is such a hurry to see the singer. But by the time her reaches the street, lo! she has vanished, and only a policeman remains. Late on, this young, adventurous Mr. Hillard again meets the young, adventurous singer under most mystifying circumstances. They dine together, but she comes in mask. What the voice has begun, the masks puts the finishing touches to. From then on Hillard is full forty fathoms deep in love and curiosity. Then the scene shifts to Italy, with the shifting fortunes of an American comic opera company, stranded at Venice. The beautiful singer becomes the prima donna of this company. The soubrette is one Kitty Killigrew, and around her flourishes a most enticing, exciting and enlivening subplot. She dances her way straight into your heart. Amusing things happen at Venice. Thrilling things happen at Monte Carlo. At Florence the climax is reached, and it makes you fairly gasp with its intense interest. At Bellaggio, the loveliest of lovely spots in the land of love, the curtain goes down on happy lovers.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">The book centers around the life of Otto, the son of German warlord Baron Conrad. Otto's mother, Baroness Matilda, has died in premature labour, brought on by the sight of the Baron's battle wounds, prompting Conrad to take his newborn son to be raised in a nearby monastery. When Otto reaches the age of eleven his father returns to claim him from the gentle monks, taking him back to live in Castle Drachenhausen, ("Dragons' House", in German) the ancestral mountaintop fortress from which the Baron launches his attacks. Here Otto learns of and is horrified by his father's life as a robber baron, and particularly the revelation of how Conrad killed a defeated, surrendering enemy, Baron Frederick, a rival robber baron who with his men was defending a column of merchants in return for the tribute they were paying him. Shortly thereafter Baron Conrad obeys a summons to the Imperial Court, taking the vast majority of his men-at-arms with him as an impressive escort but leaving Castle Drachenhausen practically undefended as a result. The late Baron Frederick's heir, his nephew Baron Henry, then attacks the castle, burning it to the ground, and taking Otto captive to his own fortress, Castle Trutzdrachen ("Dragon-scorner," in German). </p>

In his boyhood, his father wants his to be educated in the North and sent him back to Rivermouth to live with his grandfather, Captain Nutter. Nutter lives with his sister and an Irish servant. There, Tom becomes a member of a boys' club called the Centipedes. Together, the boys become involved in a series of adventures. In one prank, the boys steal an old carriage and push it into a bonfire for the [Fourth of July. During the winter, several boys build a snow fort on Slatter's Hill, inciting rival boys into a battle of snowballs. Later, Tom and three other boys combine their money to buy a boat named Dolphin and sneak away to an island. Tom also befriends a man nicknamed Sailor Ben, whom Tom originally meets on the ship that took him away from New Orleans. Revealed as the long-lost husband of Captain Nutter's Irish servant, Ben settles in Rivermouth in a boat-like cabin.

			<h4><strong>Part 1. Read the following passage: </strong></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">The subject of Cratylus is the correctness of names (περὶ ὀνομάτων ὀρθότητος), in other words, it is a critique on the subject of naming (Baxter). When discussing a ὄνομα (onoma ) and how it would relate to its subject, Socrates compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist. An artist uses color to express the essence of his subject in a painting. In much the same way, the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word's subject. There is a letter that is best for soft things, one for liquid things, and so on. He comments; the best possible way to speak consists in using names all (or most) of which are like the things they name (that is, are appropriate to them), while the worst is to use the opposite kind of names. One countering position, held by Hermogenes, is that names have come about due to custom and convention. They do not express the essence of their subject, so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them. The line between the two perspectives is often blurred. </p>

Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, a local gentleman, and Mr. Roundhay, the local vicar, come to Holmes to report that Tregennisâs two brothers have gone insane, and his sister has died. Tregennis had gone to visit them in their village (Tredannick Wollas), played whist with them, and then left. When he came back in the morning, he found them still sitting in their places at the table, the brothers, George and Owen, laughing and singing, and the sister, Brenda, dead. The housekeeper had discovered them in this state, and fainted. The vicar has not been to see them yet. Tregennis says that he remembers one brother looking through the window, and then he himself turned to see some "movement" outside. He declares that the horrific event is the work of the devil. Mortimer Tregennis was once estranged from his siblings by the matter of dividing the proceeds from the sale of the family business, but he insists that all was forgiven, although he still lives apart from them. The doctor who was summoned, reckoned that she had been dead for six hours. He also collapsed into a chair for a while after arriving. Holmes goes to the house in question and, apparently carelessly, kicks over a watering pot, soaking everyone's feet. The housekeeper tells Holmes that she heard nothing in the night, and that the family had been particularly happy and prosperous lately. Holmes observes the remains of a fire in the fireplace. Tregennis explains that it was a cold, damp night.</p>
