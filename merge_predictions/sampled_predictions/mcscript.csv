"""Oh my goodness, look at that!"" Mother said as she peeked into my room. I looked around for a monster, but all I saw was lots of mess!

"2 summers ago, my brother and went on a trip to stay with our aunt and her family for a whole week. We spent the entire week before we left preparing for this trip. The main thing that we needed to worry about was having clothes for the week. Knowing this, we got our suitcases, and made sure to set aside different clothes, including underwear, for just about each day of the next week. Then, we took some extra clothes for swimming just in case we would be doing this while we were over there. After the clothes, we made sure to pack our toiletries, like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, and so on. We packed these in a small bag the day before we left. The last thing to pack was any other items we wanted to take with us. I decided to take a blanket, and my brother decided to take a pillow. We packed these into the suitcase, and once we were sure we had everything, we went off to our aunt's house.",992a40430e0c51f51c37f13e6f6f0e6d,How many changes of clothing did they pack?,7 plus a few extra for swimming,A few,gpt2,5955ed42068dd7d162e15f1e82de7543,How many changes of clothing did they pack?,7 plus a few extra for swimming,different clothes,gpt2,0c2868637f8c8f75ebb8e1d91056ddce,Why were they packing?,For a trip to see their aunt,They wanted to be alone for a week,gpt2,c93435aabf10947fabbd52ed7f66ecfb,How many changes of clothing did they pack?,7 plus a few extra for swimming,Less clothes.,gpt2,3e6d4b1cc2c11847afd14e144303c346,Why were they packing?,For a trip to see their aunt,to protect themselves and to sleep,gpt2,fa747fe37d10b5f1fab5a5f518ff6027,Do they pack more than one suitcase?,yes,Yes they usually carry more than they have.,gpt2,268e1461193c21b3e5f87dbd051456d3,Why did they pack their swimsuits?,Because they might swim.,Clothes to sleep,gpt2,99ae9a67b89640941a15a749d0e4f18c,Why did they pack their swimsuits?,Because they might swim.,Summer vacation clothes should be taken with them when packed.,gpt2,01cb0842b427d2302cc5490eed3f0465,Why were they packing?,For a trip to see their aunt,to get ready for this trip,gpt2,3a6f47d57edf466e55d07fe310af0741,Do they pack more than one suitcase?,yes,no,gpt2,e049012220d217d6e3d4ff08fd59a0a5

"A few weeks ago I had to go visit my family in Wisconsin. Since I live in New York, it is quite a long way to drive, so I had to buy a plane ticket. It is much easier to do so today using the Internet, so I went online and searched for flights from New York to Wisconsin. There are so many flights each day, so it was important to pick one at a good date and time without too long of a layover or stop anywhere. I found a flight that was at a good time, and only had a short stop in Chicago each direction, so I booked that ticket. I was able to choose my seat and pay online, I got a confirmation number and was ready to go. I made sure to get to the airport early enough so that I could print my boarding passes, check my luggage, and get through security.

"After I had selected a DVD disk for my collection that contain the movie that I wanted to play, I removed the disc from the container, and flipped it over to the reflective side to see if there were any scratches or fingerprints that would interrupt the movie while it would be playing in the DVD player. I used a cotton ball that had been slightly soaked in rubbing alcohol to clean the reflective surface of the DVD, wiping side to side and up and down instead of in a circular pattern in order to avoid deepening any pre-existing scratches. Once I have removed all of the fingerprints and smudges, I used a dry paper tile to remove the excess alcohol and any strands that may have come off the cotton ball. Now that the DVD is ready to be played, I push the power button on the DVD player. I push the open button to release the cartridge that holds the DVD disc inside of the player. When the cartridge was ejected, I saw that there was a DVD that had already been inside the player, so I removed the DVD from the player, and placed it to the side.

"After a long day, I decided that I wanted to make some tea to sit on. I began by getting a boiling pot out of the pantry, and filling it with water from the sink. I placed the pot with water on the stove, and turned the heat on to high. While I allow the water to heat to boiling on the stove, I removed a teabag from the box, unwrapping it's from the foil and preparing it for use. I then selected my cup that I wish to drink my tea from, and placed the prepared teabag inside of the cup. After about five minutes, the water had begun to boil, so I removed the pots from the stove and poured hot water into my cup. I filled the cup with water, allowing the teabag to be submerged in the hot water, and watched as the teabag turned the water into a brownish color. I placed the pots back on the stove, and turned the heat completely off. I then grabbed my cup with one hand, and the papers them of the teabag and began to dock the teabag in a up and down motion while in the water. This encouraged the water to turn darker as more of the flavor and aroma from the teabag became dissolved into the hot water. After performing the up-and-down motion for about a minute, I placed the cup on the table, allowing the bag to sit in the water a little longer, and allow the water to cool off. After about five minutes, I took the teabag out of the water, and put in a spoonful of sugar to sweeten the tea, then I stirred the tea and sugar so that I may begin to drink the tea.",1d4d3ae6f1ceaabab74da2cdceb64c22,How long did they boil the water?,five minutes,at least 4 minutes,gpt2,c75f4a2da7890b5533edc6bca39a0005,Who made the tea?,Person at home.,speakers,gpt2,567b6d618f159f4b7683788f5cc60da2,did they add milk?,No,Yes,gpt2,cbb17d3ab6fe5d9b81756809c3972d22,Who made the tea?,Person at home.,Author,gpt2,bd69652062c23921da5a7bc31893b71a,Did they make it in the kitchen or did they boil water and bring it into another room?,Kitchen,They boiled water and brought it into another room.,gpt2,ad47d54d4f04eed09cda5bd24c1a79a6,Did they put lemon in?,No,"Yes, they did.",gpt2,aa9016cea507ae3d6ab5487021ffec81,Did they make it in the kitchen or did they boil water and bring it into another room?,Kitchen,yes,mhpg,1142a5a39b06e279bc8be3a9679b79ba,Did they put lemon in?,No,Yes,gpt2,f19f8e0ab4f1bd9e4a11163288e19f59,Who made the tea?,Person at home.,The narrator,gpt2,ae27797f8c112f0af9b7e4278e26dd80,How long did they boil the water?,five minutes,About a minute,gpt2,85fe669aa6221b004c67dbb5ae4381c4

"After dinner and bath it was time for bedtime. I made sure my kids brushed their teeth and got into their pajamas. After I tucked them snugly into their beds I sat at the edge and picked out their favorite book so we could read a few pages together. We always pass the book back and forth so we all read together. I make sure to help them if they have trouble with the words, so that we can all learn from our mistakes. We usually read a chapter in our bedtime book, but then it is time to close their eyes and drift off to sleep. I make  sure to kiss their heads before I cut off the light and pull the covers up so they stay warm.

After taking a two week trip to Europe I arrived home with lots of laundry.  I decided that I should start washing my clothes the night I arrived home.  I did three loads of laundry but I was so tired that I tossed all of the clothes onto the couch without folding them.  I woke the next morning feeling a bit refreshed and decided that is was time to tackle the pile of clothing on the couch.  First I separated the clothes into heaps based on clothing type and then I began folding all of the items.  I used to work in a clothing store so I began folding my clothes very precisely.  I folded everything neatly and made piles based on how the clothes would be stores in my closet.

So after I was done with breakfast , I sat down to prepare a grocery shopping list . I thought of all the things off the top of my head that I would need , and then I perused through my cupboards and refrigerator to fill in the blanks .

"Baking a Birthday Cake For an Awesome Nephew It was the day before my nephew 's third birthday . I wanted to bake him a very special birthday cake . He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . I poured yellow cake batter in the medium-sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' I topped off the cake with a number 3 candle .

"During the summers off I like to go to the beach on my days off.  I will start early in the morning and pack the car with a cooler with drinks and sandwiches, chairs, towels and an umbrella.  I'll drive to the beach and park as close as I can.  Gathering everything up I'll carry it across the sand till I find a nice spot down by the water.  Then ill set up my chair and umbrella, making sure to drive it deep into the sand so it doesn't blow away.  I'll make sure to put on sunscreen before I settle in my chair to sunbath for a while.  And when I am sweating and hot I'll run into the water and swim around to cool off.  While I dry off I'll have a sandwich and something to drink.

"Earlier today I decided that I would like to have a hot dog for lunch. The first thing I did was check the kitchen to make sure that I had hot dogs, buns, ketchup, and chips. When I was ready to cook lunch, I took my indoor grill out from the cabinet, plugged it in, and waited for it to heat up.

When the hot dog was halfway done cooking, I opened the lid and turned the hot dog around, so all sides would be equally browned. After the hot dog had finished cooking, I removed it from the grill and put it on my bun. Before eating my hot dog, I unplugged my grill, and wiped it down with a wet cloth.

"Early this morning I woke up to the sound of my newspaper landing on my driveway. I sat up and wrapped my pink robe around me. I slipped my feet into my slippers and looked at the clock. It was only 7:00 but it was time for me to get my newspaper and drink some coffee. I looked out the window and noticed it was raining quite a bit. I saw the newspaper at the end of my driveway, as far away as it could be. I grabbed my umbrella out of my coat closet and opened my front door enough to stick the umbrella through and open it outside. I stepped out the door and quickly covered my head with the umbrella. Then I ran to the end of my driveway, scooped up the newspaper in its plastic wrapping, and ran back to my front door. I closed my umbrella, took off my slippers, and dried off.

"Emily had fallen asleep on the sofa after supper while we were all watching the new movie Dad had rented. The movie had been boring, and Emily had fallen quickly asleep. Mom asked me to try to wake her when the movie was over, but she just snored louder every time I tried to shake her awake. She was such a deep sleeper. Dad sometimes joked that she could sleep through a brass band marching through her room. I believed it now. I had tried very hard to wake her up. I went in and told my mom I couldn't get her up. Mom smiled and hugged me, told me good night, and patted my head. I went into the living room to watch as she kissed Emily on the forehead. She gently slid her arms under Emily's sleeping body, and lifted her up to chest level. I followed her up the stairs and to the room me and Emily shared.

"Every Friday I make a point to clean my room.  Part of cleaning my room involves stripping my bed and changing my sheets.  First I take off all of the bedding from my bed.  Then, I take the sheets and take them to the laundry room.  I put them in the washing machine to get them nice and clean.  After that, I put them on the clothes line to dry them outside.

Then, we go get the five placemats out of the side cabinet. After we set the placemats neatly at chair. After we set a placemat at each chair, we go get the plates. Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa all get big plates, but Tom is still little, so he gets a small plastic plate. We set a plate on each placemat. Now we need a napkin for each place. Luckily, we still have some napkins left over from the birthday party last week, so we will use those. It doesn't matter that they say ""Happy Birthday."" We put a folded napkin to the left side of each plate. On top of each napkin we put a fork. Except for Tom, he gets a small fork. On the right side of the plate we put a knife and spoon. We need to be careful with the knives. Closer to the center of the table we put a glass by each plate. Tom gets a plastic glass, because he isn't ready for a real glass one yet.

"For dinner last night I decided to make some Tom Kha soup.  It was a cold November evening, and I was getting over a slight cold.  Soup always makes me feel better in these situations.  I always find Tom Kha to be especially good as a cold remedy.  I had already been to the grocery store and gotten all the ingredients I needed.  I chopped up some lemongrass and ginger and started cooking them in some chicken broth with lime leaves.  While this was simmering, I chopped up some chicken, and placed that in the pot as well.  Then I added the coconut milk, fish sauce, and mushrooms.  I let it simmer for a while to let all the tastes blend.

"For dinner tonight I decided to cook pasta. I entered my kitchen and grabbed a pot from under the stove. I filled the pot to the brim with water and placed the pot on the stove. I turned the heat on high so that the water would boil. While I was waiting for the water to boil I entered my pantry and chose the type of pasta I would be making. I had various choices such as spaghetti, penne, angel hair and elbow macaroni. I decided on penne. Approximately twenty minutes after I placed the water to boil on the stove the water was at a rolling boil which is perfect for cooking pasta. I turned the heat down on the stove to medium. I grabbed an empty bowl from my cupboard and filled it with penne pasta so I had one serving. I dumped the bowl of pasta in the water. After doing this I added a pinch of salt because it gives the pasta flavor. I took a wooden spoon and stirred the pasta occasionally. After about fifteen minutes I took my wooden spoon and tried the texture of the pasta to ensure it was filly cooked and tender.

Friday night my friend Stacey called me and invited me to go bowling with her and her friends.  I was excited and met them at the bowling alley about ten minutes from my home.

I am more of a cook rather than a baker of pastries and sweets . But with the internet and YouTube anything can be found . I searched YouTube to find a good simple but interesting set of instructions . I decided on a chocolate cake as I am weak when it comes to resisting chocolate . I gathered all of the ingredients and placed them on the counter along with measuring cups and spoons . I could not believe how much sugar goes into the baking of a cake but that 's why it 's not a health food . All the ingredients went into a bowl for me to mix with a 1980 's hand held electric mixer . While the over was preheating I scooped a the mixture into a well greased baking pan . Naturally my finger stole a taste of the raw cake . After placing the bowl in the oven and and waiting the proper time I removed the cake and frosted it after it cooled down .

"I am so excited to learn how to drive today with Scott. We are in a large vacant parking lot and no one else is around so it will be perfectly safe for us, the car and anyone else. As we both get in the car, we put on our seatbelts. Check. Now he instructs me to put the key in the ignition and give it a gentle turn forward toward the front of the car. I hear the engine crank and can feel it hum. He tells me to grab the crankshaft and put it into the ""D"" position. I feel the car surge forward and immediately hit the brake pedal on the left and car stops. He tells me it's fine and to give it a little gas. The car begins to move forward as travel in a straight line.

"I decided that I wanted to eat toasted bread with my breakfast, so I opened the loaf of bread and removed two slices from the package. I took those two slices of bread and put them into the toaster, putting each slice of bread into its own open slots.

I decided to make dinner for my family this Friday night. I had a few ingredients for making spaghetti but I still needed spaghetti sauce and bread rolls. I already had the noodles at my house. I drove my car to my nearest supermarket. I grabbed a shopping cart and entered the store. I strolled the aisles until I found the Italian food isle. I looked around for my favorite spaghetti sauce and found it. i put it into my shopping cart and proceeded to go to the bakery section. I ordered some freshly baked Italian bread rolls. I put all the items into my shopping cart and started making my way towards the cashier check out. I placed my items on the cashier desk and paid for my items. After paying I went back to my car in the parking lot and placed the items inside my car. I drove home and started boiling the pasta and heating up the spaghetti sauce. I put the bread into the oven to heat it up. After 20 minutes the meal was ready and I sat down at the table with my family and enjoyed the meal.

"I don't normally receive phone calls on my house phone, I only have one because it came with my home internet package. Today, the phone rang. I didn't hear it at first as I was doing dishes, because I keep the cordless phone in my bedroom on my nightstand. I finally heard it after the third or fourth ring I'd say, and ran into my room to answer it. I wasn't surprised to hear the voice on the other end was a female telemarketer.

"I drove the the bowling alley closest to my house. I walked in the door and went to the counter. I told the cashier how many games I would like to play. He asked if I would like to rent bowling shoes. I said yes. The cashier asked my shoe size and I told him I wore a size 9. The cashier went to the back and got the right size shoes. The cashier told me my total and I paid the bill. After I paid, the cashier told me what lane I would be using.  I then went and picked out a bowling ball. I picked a hot pink bowling ball. I then went to the lane that was assigned to me. I put in my name on the computer and began my game. I played 4 games. I then started to get hungry so I went to the snack stand and ordered nachos. After I ate my nachos, I played two more games. I then returned my bowling ball to the proper place, and returned my shoes to the cashier.  The cashier told me to have a nice day and to return soon.

"I felt very hungry so I looked in my fridge for something to eat. A hot dog package caught my eye. It looked tasty to eat and thought it could curb my hunger.  I took out the package and read the instructions for cooking. There are a few different ways to cook hot dogs, microwave, boiling on the barbeque or grill. I decided since I was so hungry already and did not want to wait long I would use the microwave method. I opened up the package and took out a hot dog. Placing it on a paper towel I set the cook time for 20 seconds. It was ready then but very hot. I took out a bun and then spread some mustard, relish and ketchup on it as well.

I had already picked the spot it was to go , a place in the middle of my yard where it could get full sun . After gathering the shovel and watering hose , and putting on my gardening gloves , I set to work on digging the hole . I had to make sure the hole was deep enough to fit its roots comfortably . I dampened the soil in the hole with a little water . Once the hole was ready , I laid the tree on its side and gently removed the pot from it . I placed the sapling into the hole and looked to see that the base of its trunk would be level with the ground , then began scraping the soil back into the hole , over the roots . I tamped the soil down , so as to prevent any air pockets , and watered it once more .

"I had a break between my classes and was feeling a little hungry. I walked to the library and went into the basement where the vending machines were. I did not want a whole meal, so a vending machine snack seemed like a good choice. After looking through my options I decided that some animal crackers would do the trick and help me feel full and alert before my next class.

I turned on the washing machine by setting the dial to the the amount of time to wash the clothes. I also set a knob for how full the washer was. I also set the temperature of the water. After the clothes were done washing I put them into the dryer. I set the dryer for 30 minutes because I think that is how long it will take to try them. I did everything above for the colored clothes except put in bleach. I only washed 2 loads of clothes.,020635a1711656f6227f402d9e6089ca,Did they use bleach?,"Yes, they did/",Yes they did.,gpt2,c70f8b9fd8309a345d134397ec9753ec,How did they wash the clothes?,with a washing machine,By Hand,gpt2,a3cb6abd9f3c289cec48f8d114a33cca,Who did the laundry?,narrator,Good man and woman,gpt2,5b5899b61d39d4ab9eccda5cf69e1f68,How did they wash the clothes?,with a washing machine,Put them in the washing machine.

"I had been having issues with heartburn.  It's like everytime I had a meal, I was in pain and in agony.  Finally, I decided it was time to see the doctor.  I called the receptionist at the office to make an appointment.  She asked me what my problems were and booked me down for the next week.   I came in early for my appointment.  They had me update my health insurance card and fill out some paper work.  Then it was a short wait before the nurse called my name.  She brought me to the back and got my weight and other information.  We talked a bit and she led me into the exam room.  It wasn't long before the doctor came in.

"I had been on a trip to Boston, and it was time for my flight home.  I arrived at the airport ninety minutes before my flight was scheduled to leave to insure I had sufficient time to check in, pass through security and make it to the flight gate.  I had confirmed my reservation ahead of time and printed out a boarding pass which I took with me to the airport.  When I arrived I had luggage to check.  Since I arrived in with enough time I checked my bags at the check in counter.  There was a much shorter line for people who already had their boarding pass.  They gave me receipts which I would need to claim my luggage at my destination.  I put the receipts in my wallet so I would not loose them.  Next there was a line for the security screening.  I patiently waited in the line with the other passengers.  It took 30 minutes to get through the line.  At the screening check point they verified I was not carrying any dangerous items.

"I had been putting of visiting a doctor because my regular primary care provider was nearly a mile away, and I owed the money that I simply did not have. I decide to visit an office that was much closer. I was so glad I did because they had sliding scale fee that drastically reduced the cost of doctor visits and specialists that I desperately needed to see. I filled out all the necessary paperwork and had a visit scheduled. The date came and I went to see my new primary care provider. I had anxiety as I always do when seeing a medical professional. She ended up being incredibly kind and understanding and she gave me a referral to see a chiropractor. I was so happy that I was finally going to be able to see someone to help with my back pain.

"I had holidays in the last week. It was a long weekend and I planned to watch some movie. My father gave an idea to gather my friends and watch some good movie and he promised to help in playing the movie. I invited some of my interested friends to watch the movie. We discussed and decided to watch the animation movie 'Up'. I went to the shop along with my father to buy the DVD for the movie 'Up'. My father taught me to connect the DVD player to our television. Once the player is connected, I had to insert the disc in the player through the proper hole. Once the disc is placed, I had to switch on the play button to get the movie played. After the movie is finished we have to push the stop button and get the disc out of the player. I learned everything well from my father and played the movie once our friends gathered.

"I had just moved into a new home.  The house had been empty for quite a few years.  As a result, there was a lot of remodeling to do.  One of the first things I decided to do was paint the living room walls.  The walls were currently painted an ugly yellow and the paint was peeling.  I went to the paint store and looked over the paint colors.  I settled on a calming blue.  I figured out how much paint I would need by calculating the area of the room, then I bought enough gallons to cover the job.

"I had just moved into a new home.  The house had been empty for quite a few years.  As a result, there was a lot of remodeling to do.  One of the first things I decided to do was paint the living room walls.  The walls were currently painted an ugly yellow and the paint was peeling.  I went to the paint store and looked over the paint colors.  I settled on a calming blue.  I figured out how much paint I would need by calculating the area of the room, then I bought enough gallons to cover the job.  I left the store and loaded the paint and supplies I bought into my car.  After getting home, I spread a plastic drop cloth over the floor and got the paint ready.

"I have a problem with picking scabs off of my skin. One of the only ways I can combat this is to apply a band aid over the areas to prevent myself from picking at them. To put on the band aid, I open the wrapper and then take off the two little pieces of glossy paper protecting the sticky adhesive side. I then place the band aid over the spot that I either picked already or want to prevent myself from picking. Once i do that, I throw away all the band aid remnants.

I have never had to ride a public bus until 4 years ago when I had no other transportation and was forced to take a public bus anywhere I needed to go . The first thing I had to do was find a bus schedule and learn how to read the time and places to catch the bus and how to make any needed transfers . This was a little hard to do but once I figured it out it was OK as long as I always kept a schedule with me . I mostly took the bus to work and I only had to worry about catching one bus on the street I lived on and I did not have to sorry about any transfers . The bus ride cost me $ 1.25 and transfers where an additional 50 cents . Many people rode the bus and I meet several nice people on the bus . The bus drivers were always nice and I became friends with several of them . The bus only came once an hour and I had to make sure I did not miss it if I was going to work because then I would be late for work . The bus always made a stop at the main depot in order to pick up more people . There was usually about a 20 minute wait so the driver could have break in the late afternoon . I did not like having to take the bus but it served my purpose for a while and I was thankful to have the bus available .,eccb2db308916c4881c8135a22a7e675,How much did they pay for the bus ride?,$1.25 + $0.50 per transfer,$ 1.25,gpt2,cd9f968aa304af1e59e1059e58399b1e,Were they meeting other people?,Yes,"Yes, meeting other people",gpt2,21ad96a76ea35d2c2fe37cbe9f2b4132,When did the bus come,Every hour it came by the same bus stop,back 4 years ago,gpt2,f91135f240f0180901848dc1446a00cd,How much did they pay for the bus ride?,$1.25 + $0.50 per transfer,they pay for the ride,gpt2,f7c8ca7e809702cd5dc42715345027d0,Who drove the bus?,The bus drivers,The narrator,gpt2,fba2dac4e1ce3374d3719e27b9f9d919,Were they meeting other people?,Yes,"Yes, they always had to catch buses",gpt2,50121e8c220440e23ff93c1cb5fb9059,When did the bus come,Every hour it came by the same bus stop,to go to work,gpt2,3f17e2f985cd8153d26b2722b96e62e1,Was the bus driver friendly?,Yes,No.,gpt2,a860c6344c7584fcc8470e09737cd625,Who drove the bus?,The bus drivers,The author,gpt2,ed0ffa8d7a17fb03c198285c024c6244,Were they meeting other people?,Yes,No,gpt2,9a5eb6644cd14dc6234b8975c7e3629f

I just bought a new house so I need to decorate it with art. I have lots of paintings but I just bought a new one that I know will great above the fireplace.  I have a ladder that is just the right height so I climb it with my measuring tape in hand. I measure to the center of the wall and mark the spot with a pencil. Then I get my girlfriends screw gun and put a screw in the wall. Now it's time to get the painting and hang it on the screw. I take a step back and see if I like it. It's also important to see if my girlfriend likes it. When she gets home from work we both stare at the painting and make sure it's even on the wall and that we like where it is placed. We are both satisfied with the painting.,2a8a320e8aa402610d3aa512dc7f77c6,How long did it take to hang it?,A few minutes,minutes,backtranslation,0ce4df8b07a1ee774856b67425ec94cd,Why should they measure the painting before they hang it?,To make sure it fits,a picture isofart,gpt2,ebe45d7f99336b1ec655a887dc38a691,Why should they measure the painting before they hang it?,To make sure it fits,To make sure it's on the wall,gpt2,255f7d3b97e9cf13e5ba13d6b2bde4f5,How long did it take to hang it?,A few minutes,A couple minutes,gpt2,9a1b21382786ac654dc38957a42f16d1,Who helped them put up the painting?,Nobody,narrator,gpt2,a0f441fbc17d177076f5965867c91c49,Why should they measure the painting before they hang it?,To make sure it fits,see if even the walls are min,gpt2,6e6fe67b9064068390556ae620bff575,How long did it take to hang it?,A few minutes,A few seconds.,gpt2,540dbce939f5d6c1d2e8be140e177a19,Who helped them put up the painting?,Nobody,Nobody helped,gpt2,2884f63b956bd9346e9cbbfa947e77f7,Who helped them put up the painting?,Nobody,Noone,gpt2,fd7f240501ca99337b87dd9c264e7942,How long did it take to hang it?,A few minutes,A few hours,gpt2,3e64dab0c59deebf2640961066619d6d

"I looked at my sink which contained a ton of dirty dishes that needed to be washed and put away. I removed the dirty dishes from the sink and plugged the drain. I turned the faucet on and let the sink fill with water as I poured in a decent amount of dish soap. The bubbles from the soap rose up to the edge of the sink. Once the sink was full, I turned the water off and placed the dishes into the water. I grabbed a wash cloth and put it into the water to get it wet. I repeatedly scrubbed each dish and rinsed them off in a stream of cool water. Then I placed them on a drying mat I had placed next to the sink.

"I love cherries . I thought it would nice if I had a cherry tree in my backyard . There was plenty of room in my yard for a large tree , so I decided to plant one .

I love shopping online. Last weekend I wanted to order some vitamins. I looked on two web sites to find exactly the kind of vitamins I wanted. And I also looked at prices. I even tried to find some near me so that they would be shipped to me quick. The quickest way to get them and not have to pay too much money would cause them to get to me in four days. So I decided to order and wait. On Monday morning there was a package by my front door. I opened it. It was the vitamins. It took less than 24 hours for them to get to me. I was happy the vitamins were here. I tried to figure out how they go to me so quick. Then I figured out that they came from an Amazon facility near me.

I love to drive. About 6 months ago I drove to a town about 100 miles away. The day before I made sure I had a full tank of gas and that the car was clean inside and out for the trip. I left on my trip in the morning. I was glad the car was clean and full of gas so I would not have to do all that stuff right before going on the trip. It was a Saturday morning and not too much traffic. I live in a city. It took about 45 minutes to get out of town. I like driving safely and giving plenty of room ahead of me and the vehicle in front of me. You never know when someone will do something stupid and I will have to swerve out of the way. On my trip everyone drove safely and I did not have to swerve out of the way.,b4fb5119258eebc70200cdd61d4eff4b,How many people were in the car?,One.,a few,gpt2,913d2e77396a5c80c147ca1df3527317,Where did they drive to?,A town 100 miles away.,city 100 miles from the coast .,backtranslation,7bf41974fb6efbbf92d45d6cb7595c83,How many people were in the car?,One.,1,gpt2,c1a177d3be234e3f04c6c2685417e584,How many people were in the car?,One.,Two.,gpt2,56e2ef878eae83e9ee4875a5ae326412,Why were they driving?,they went out of town,they were going to go eat,gpt2,aba66414e89dcde89aca197823461e5a,How many people were in the car?,One.,you're not .,backtranslation,5d36770bc4ab8bc4c650895d28f98a4b,Why were they driving?,they went out of town,Clean and full of gas.,gpt2,c08553d8b5cf1a22803d6ef81bc5e1d7,Why were they driving?,they went out of town,to get a car,mhpg,01947e6139aa57ba064da94e88051fee,Why were they driving?,they went out of town,they needed gas for a trip,gpt2,2583dca506d34aadb4c79da6b859a126,Where did they drive to?,A town 100 miles away.,The town.,gpt2,29787b8d2cc256c86de7a7dc7605dfba
I love to make hot chocolate in the wintertime. Today it snowed so I decided to make myself a mug of hot cocoa. Some people just put a mug of water in the microwave and then add Swiss Miss. Not me. I use milk in mine. First I put the milk in a sauce pan. Then I put it on the burner on medium high heat. While the milk is heating up I get mix cocoa and sugar together. I have to be careful while boiling milk because once I did it for too long. Then a skin formed on top and it was gross. I learned after that that as soon as it boils I need to pull it off the burner.Once the milk comes to a boil I pour it into a mug. Then I add the cocoa.

"I love to play with my friends, and we play with all sorts of fun and cool toys and games.  When my friends and I are finished playing, we know it is time to clean up our toys.  We all work together to help, and put all the toys back in their boxes, and then we put the boxes away on the proper shelves.  It is important to take good care of our belongings, so we can play with them again another day.  It is important to make sure all the pieces are found, and put back in the right boxes.  It is no fun when someone wants to do a puzzle, and there are pieces missing, or when we want to play a game, but the cards or dice are not in the box!

"I miss my best friend Shelly and so I decided to send her a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister’s house in Alaska, and to also tell her that I hoped she was well. I finished writing my letter and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send it, I had found that I did not have any. I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes, and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail my letter in.  After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers, and chose a heart design that I liked. I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to. When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly’s name and address in the middle, and wrote my sister’s address in the top left corner of the envelope.

I needed to put wall paper on the walls of my room. The room was in dire need of new wall paper. The old wall paper was looking bad. I asked my friend Ryan to help me put new wall paper up. He was a painter and regularly did this kind of work. I first removed the old wall paper from the walls with Ryan. We then got the new wall paper and applied it to the walls. It required us to brush down the paper so it would stick. We checked to make sure everything was even. I did not want uneven wall paper.

"I planned to go to the shopping centre all week. Finally it was shopping day. I dressed comfortably, made my shopping list and grabbed my purse.  On my walk to the shopping centre  I thought about all the things I would buy. Most of the things on my list were items I needed. A tooth brush, some bread, pencils, socks. I had clipped some coupons and knew I would save a few dollars so that I could get that new game I like. I couldn't wait to see it on the shelf and actually hold it in my hands. I arrived at the shopping centre. It wasn't very busy and I was glad of that. First I did all of my important shopping. And sure enough I had enough money for the game. I rushed to the electronics section and sunk in despair when I saw the shelf was empty. They were sold out of the game I had waited so long to play.

I really enjoy all sports and I find that playing tennis is an excellent way to stay in shape.  I just moved to a new neighborhood and there are some public tennis courts in the park across from my apartment.  I decided to take some tennis lessons during the winter to make sure that I would be ready to play when spring came.  I really enjoyed the lessons and I actually became a pretty good player.  I decided to join a recreational tennis league in my neighborhood.  I joined a women's singles league and I have had a really good time playing tennis once or twice a week.  It's very convenient to meet right at the neighborhood courts and play tennis for an hour in the evenings.  I even decide dot treat myself to a brand new tennis racket.  Tennis is a sport that I hope to continue playing as I get older.,fd8768d68a5cac081bbeccdd3cebb6b5,Where were they playing tennis at?,The park by the author's house has a tennis court.,in the park,gpt2,6cbe84b46cd2adcf0273ea3599a78f9a,Was there an umpire?,"No, there was not.",no Not sure,gpt2,2d9583ef9a32f78d6e9c8b689be97793,How did they get the tennis equipment?,They bought it themselves,yes,mhpg,37a9c656fb57740194abb6e9946bce3a,Were they playing tennis in a park?,Yes they were playing in the park.,Yes,gpt2,25969d5630c7edb6306975596cfcf162,Where were they playing tennis at?,The park by the author's house has a tennis court.,yes,mhpg,abadb043a18446775fe0def513827e2d,Was there an umpire?,"No, there was not.","No, his sister's",gpt2,23e6d0c9cc2908b461a81ce1e0c299a2,Where were they playing tennis at?,The park by the author's house has a tennis court.,The tennis courts in the park.,gpt2,e36891a1e225ee358283518f6493d397,How did they get the tennis equipment?,They bought it themselves,They bought a tennis racket.,gpt2,a3f08d86c46e0402a7a870e5738b1018,How did they get the tennis equipment?,They bought it themselves,They bought tennis shoes.,gpt2,275ec27ef3cc9b0300709100966afc35,Was there an umpire?,"No, there was not.",yes,gpt2,27f85268ec463b667c13465228280aed

"I recently attended the wedding of two friends of mine from college.  It was a long drive away, so my date and I drove there in regular street clothes.  We changed into our formal wedding wear once we arrived at the hotel where we would be staying for the evening.  We drove to the church and walked in.  The wedding was about to start so we quickly found some seats near other friends of ours.  An organ began to play, which let us know that the ceremony was starting.  Members of the wedding party arrived in a procession.  The bride was the last to arrive at the altar.  A minister performed the ceremony.  The bride and groom exchanged vows and also exchanged rings.  When the ceremony finished, the couple kissed, and everyone applauded.  Then the bride and groom and their bridesmaids and groomsmen marched back out of the church.  Afterwards, they took many pictures before the reception.",023bb32ef9e2a04de2ba5ae06d6c278e,Who got married?,Two of the person's friends from college.,Friends of them.,gpt2,f7388782150776c2a64ed0b508f997b8,Where was the wedding located?,At a church.,In a hotel filled largely with tablecloths,gpt2,5a0405630cb238fa46a95569d6c871b1,When did they leave the ceremony?,After everyone applauded,after they were married,gpt2,3f9de70b524c111eaafea0c0ec5f59a1,Where was the wedding located?,At a church.,A church.,gpt2,bdf4008e7e914a4672ed93c1e2ad65ef,Where was the wedding located?,At a church.,In their own town.,gpt2,88be08f2a6e3c06bfe1b1db9843c8cfe,Who got married?,Two of the person's friends from college.,the author,gpt2,822892bfb7a07466e50b108943851744,Who got married?,Two of the person's friends from college.,Their friend and their friend,gpt2,ae2013fcf3ca621d5f1cefe3d754f208,When did they leave the ceremony?,After everyone applauded,when they were in the wedding,mhpg,909fae0246f728163ac1cf777acd7849,When did they leave the ceremony?,After everyone applauded,After the guests arrived,gpt2,5cc710687d8d6d1e3f8cb68b538b72dd,When did they leave the ceremony?,After everyone applauded,during middle of the day,gpt2,d9708dc29aabbbda691fb12731f57f68

I made a list of everyone that I wanted to invite. Then, I went to the store to buy the invitations.

I looked through the selection of cards there until I found a few that I liked. Deciding that I wanted to send a variety of different cards to my friends, I bought a few of each card until I had enough cards for everyone.

"I recently was at a sporting event and decided I was hungry and wanted to buy something to eat.  I spotted a vending machine tucked in the corner of a stairwell that sold small snacks and drinks.  I approached the vending machine and looked through the glass to decide what I wanted.  I found a bag of chips that I know I like and decided that is what I would buy.  I read the price of the chips was one dollar.  I reached into my wallet and retrieved the dollar needed to purchase the chips.  I looked back into the vending machine and found that the chips were located in the B4 position.  I put my dollar into the machine and pressed the ""B"" button and then the ""4"" button.

"I remember the day that my brother got married like it was yesterday. The ceremony was perfect. He and his bride found a quaint little winery nestled in Virginia, right smack dab in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley. I arrived that morning and checked into my hotel with my date. I feel like I was more nervous then my brother! I quickly showered and pulled on my suit, before heading down to the ceremony. I pulled aside my brother and gave him a hug. I told him how proud of him I was, and how happy I was for his bride to become a part of our family. He thanked me and we made our way down.

"I ride the bus to school everyday . I live in New York City so riding the bus is a common thing . Everyone does it because it is convenient . In our city , it is very packed , so driving is n't as convenient or affordable . Parking is expensive so public transportation saves us a lot of money . Every morning when I go to school , I wait by the bus stop . The morning bus comes every ten minutes . Once it arrives I board onto the bus and I insert my metro card . The metro card has a balance of money stored inside it . This money is subtracted from the balance every time I ride the bus and insert my metro card . Basically the metro card pays for the bus ride . When I run out of money , I go to a metro card machine and put more money into my balance . Riding the bus is annoying sometimes . In the morning , it is very crowded so sometimes there are n't enough seats for everybody . This means I have to stand while holding on to a pole . Sometimes its so crowded that I am sandwiched in between people . If I am lucky , sometimes there will be open seats .

"I sometimes put a gift in a box, if it doesn't already have one, to make it easier to wrap. It's nice to put tissue paper inside the box, too. That makes opening the gift more interesting. After I have the gift boxed, I assemble my wrapping supplies. I use rolled wrapping paper, clear tape, scissors, and ribbon. Next, I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper. I  study it, trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll. I don't want to waste paper, but I also want to neatly cover the gift. Once I decide how much paper to cut off, I mark the place with pencil, then fold there, and cut the paper along the fold line.

"I took a public bus to get the work this morning . At around 8 am , I left my apartment and walked to the nearest bus stop which was about a 10 minute walk from home . Once I got there , I waited for the bus to arrive along with two other people . After about 15 minutes , an express bus heading to Manhattan arrived . I boarded the bus and paid the driver my fare . I then walked to a window seat near the front of the bus , that was free . It was pretty early , and the bus was initially somewhat empty . However , several stops later , the bus was filled with fellow commuters heading to work . Along the way , the bus passed through about 5 different towns while traveling on local roads , before headed out to the George Washington Bridge to get to Manhattan . While getting there , the bus ran into a traffic jam which caused a 20 minute delay . After working its way through traffic , the bus made it onto the bridge , and several minutes later , we were at the bus terminal on 178th Street .

"I walk into the kitchen. I am hungry. It is still early in the morning, so breakfast would be appropriate. Eggs should do it. I open my refrigerator and grab 1 egg. I look in my cabinets and also grab a small pan. I put the pan on the stove and turn the knob on the side of the stove until the gas lights underneath my pan. I keep the fire low. While this heats up, I grab some butter from my refrigerator. I also get a spatula from my kitchen drawer. I scoop some butter out of the container with my spatula, then transfer the butter to the small pan. The butter begins to melt on the stove top. It is time to crack my egg and begin cooking. I crack my egg lightly on the counter top until the contents begin to ooze. I position my egg over the small pan and break the egg into two pieces, so that the egg lands on the small pan.

I wanted to plan a trip to visit my Dad in Maui so decided to go over Thanksgiving because I could stay for longer and would not have to use as many vacation days. I confirmed with him that the dates were OK and started looking at airfare. The best prices I could find consisted of two layovers and included an overnight flight but I was willing to suffer a little bit to save a few hundred dollars. After I booked my flight I gave my Dad the information and he said he would schedule some days off to spend with me. I did some research on things I would like to do in Maui and decided I wanted to go whale watching and possibly snorkeling if the weather was nice. Dad made the reservations since he gets a discount as a resident. I also found some restaurants that I wanted to try. I thought about if I needed to buy anything before I went and decided to pack light and purchase essentials there to not risk my bag getting lost.

I did some research on things I would like to do in Maui and decided I wanted to go whale watching and possibly snorkeling if the weather was nice. Dad made the reservations since he gets a discount as a resident. I also found some restaurants that I wanted to try. I thought about if I needed to buy anything before I went and decided to pack light and purchase essentials there to not risk my bag getting lost. The trip went as planned and was very relaxing and beautiful.,a175dcb92e700a44c5e920a999db7376,Who would be going on the trip?,They will,a mom,gpt2,3d2b2093967ce2f9cfe90e798e47bd4d,Who planned the trip?,The person telling the story.,the dad,mhpg,522107fe46a158872f1c679625c012e2,Why did they choose the location they did?,it is where their dad lives,It was the place they wanted to visit.,gpt2,523f272b77a5309b23868220f44a2f5d,Did they have fun?,"Yes, they had a nice time.",yes they did,gpt2,3e8b21e16304abeae37a959e5592e10b,Did they have fun?,"Yes, they had a nice time.",Yes,gpt2,2c854d7694ddf4cdda7241bda14e6cbe,Will they need warm or cold weather clothes?,They needed warm weather clothes.,Warm weather clothes were available for $5.00,gpt2,b65e28afe61983df8055449af3cf5f25,Will they need warm or cold weather clothes?,They needed warm weather clothes.,the flight bag was purchase,mhpg,4b7503d10eb0d08954897db7944f31da,Why did they pick that location?,That's where their dad lives.,it was beautiful and the weather was nice,gpt2,1aebb0787257ea33f16a78100c1ba85b,Who did they visit on their trip?,They were seeing their dad.,Their Dad,gpt2,de8c696e3738525f82ed1af0973312eb,Why did they choose the location they did?,it is where their dad lives,They wanted to visit their dad,gpt2,1537c8f12bfb504767e36746875f8c1e
I wanted to redo my master bathroom.  The bathroom was old and not up to date.  I looked at a bunch of magazines and different bathrooms to get inspiration on how I wanted my newly renovated bathroom to look.  I decided to do marble counters and ceramic floor tiles.  I also decided to redo the shower with a frameless glass shower door and chrome fixtures.  I then asked friends and family for referrals on contractors.  I contacted three different contractors that my friends referred to me as reliable and got some bids.  The bids were very close in price but different in when they could start and finish.  I picked the person who I thought gave me a realistic time frame on when the work could be done.  The work started and the contractor demolished the existing bathroom but then took over a week to come back and renovate the bathroom.  It took longer than I thought it would but the end result is great.  I love my new bathroom.

I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire. Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry. I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs.

We were in the middle of a peek a boo game when I smelled something off.  I knew he needed his diaper changed.  I went to the hallway and grabbed his diaper bag.  Then, I took out his green changing mat.  I searched through the bag and grabbed a clean diaper, the wipes and some baby powder.  Then I grabbed my nephew and took off his pants and unsnapped his onesie.  He was awfully wriggly, so I knew I'd have to do this quickly!  I took off his dirty diaper. Then, I took out a wipe from the container and wiped his backside.  When I was sure he was clean enough, I put the clean diaper under him and sprinkled baby powder over him.

"I was bored and wanted to play a game. This time I decided I would go bowling. I drove to a bowling alley and payed the worker there to rent some bowling shoes. I put the shoes on to make sure they fit, and was told which lane would be mine to bowl in. I went to my lane with my bowling ball, which was just the right size and not too heavy. I stepped up to the line on the floor and swung the ball under my right shoulder onto the floor. The ball hit the floor and rolled quickly down the center of the lane.

"I was excited to be going to Cancun in two weeks . I brought my tickets a few months before , and when the day arrived , I simply printed out the ticket from my computer . I brought my two suitcases filled with clothes and necessities , along with my visa and other important travel documents . Once I got to the airport , I passed by security and they checked my bags for anything that was illegal or dangerous . Once I got past the checkpoint , I waited at a terminal for an hour . They began to call for my plane and I got on line . I gave the lady my visa and ticket and I boarded the airplane . I put the luggage above my head in the luggage department and sat down . My seat was next to a window so I was very happy about that . Soon a person sat down next to me . We were told to eventually put our seat belts on as we were ready to fly . We watched a short video on what to do in case we felt some turbulence and what to do in case of emergency . Then the airplane lifted off and I was scared at first , I felt some shaking but eventually we were in the air and everything was okay . Eventually they began to serve food .

There was so much to see! There was a room about different kinds of rocks and where they came from. Another part of the museum had skeletons from all different kinds of old animals--dinosaurs, a sabretooth tiger, and even a mammoth! The plaques next to them told me all about when and where the animals lived. While I was at the museum, I moved from one room to the next and took my time to read as much as I could so I could really enjoy the trip.

I got behind the wheel made sure I checked the mirrors so I could see everything around me. I put my seat belt on and told the instructor to put theirs on too. I adjusted my seat so I could reach the pedals and steering wheel comfortably. It was time to put the key in the ignition and start the car. After the car was on I checked the mirrors to make sure I would not hit anything and backed out the parking spot.

I smiled back, relieved that the worst part might be over.  At least she looked like a friendly girl.  We ordered food and talked to each other as we ate.  She and I really had a lot in common!  After dinner, I walked her to her apartment and she gave me her phone number and a good night kiss.  I was so happy!

"I was living in my very first apartment of my own, and my parents were coming to visit. However, the apartment was very dirty so I needed to clean it up quickly before my parents got there. I started with the kitchen. I put all of the dishes in the dishwasher and ran it. Then, I wiped off all of the counter tops and made sure that everything on the counters was neatly arranged.  I then moved onto the bathroom. I quickly scrubbed out the toilet and the bathtub, and wiped down the bathroom counter. I also made sure to clean the mirror. I moved onto my bedroom. I picked up all of my clothes off of the floor, rearranged the items on my dresser, and made my bed. Finally, I went to clean the living room.

"I was walking to my car last night from work and was ready to drive home . I started the car up , but I noticed that I left my phone at work , so I turned the ignition back off , locked the car doors , and shut the driver door . Unfortunately for me , I shut the door WITH my keys still in the ignition . That 's right ; I was locked out of my own car . Flustered and embarrassed , I pulled at the handles of the doors and attempted to open the trunk off the car - no luck at all . I walked back to my office , got my phone , and contemplated what I would do next . There was no one there with me , so my only hope was riding the public bus -LRB- I did n't have money for a cab -RRB- . I waited for the bus , the last one of the night , at the bus stop . The bus driver opened the door for me and I came aboard . I paid the two dollar bus fare so that I could ride and asked him for a transfer so that I could get on the next bus at the terminal . I took my seat , and the bus took me to the terminal at the plaza . I got off the bus and hopped on the bus that would take me home . I handed the transfer to the driver and took my seat . As I approached my apartment , I pushed the button to request for the bus to stop . The driver pulled over , and I thanked them and got off . When I got in the apartment , I immediately jumped into my bed . I was dead-tired , and though I had the dilemma of having my keys locked in the car , I would figure that out in the morning .",d9bc33f9d13d050ef8b49abe2ee872e5,Who did they go to the bus stop with?,Nobody,The passengers.,gpt2,bbb383b7ab46b2fc6fa1abfc636904b4,Why did they take the bus?,They couldn't afford a cab,to make the car,mhpg,40dee94e51b9b8e1ed27bc71fa727bf6,Why did they take the bus?,They couldn't afford a cab,To get there early,gpt2,fd7013632fd721fb38bbdf324b961906,Why did they take the bus?,They couldn't afford a cab,They were tired,gpt2,2ace64d6cab14f2299594677845c62cd,Who drove the bus?,bus driver,The author,gpt2,43e6d12254af4473f1f083548de8abb3,Why did they take the bus?,They couldn't afford a cab,to work,gpt2,c5f9b442215d0bea5ae2a37bfe9c34d3,Who drove the bus?,bus driver,The narrator,gpt2,4ed18cd6fd4153ce50a9894f7267548d,Who drove the bus?,bus driver,The story teller.,gpt2,585a5a2d2059181f8f2fca26e3d5291d,Who did they go to the bus stop with?,Nobody,The narrator,gpt2,bd677caeaac071445177c241b2df6307,Who did they go to the bus stop with?,Nobody,A driver.,gpt2,8d7b550077a8acecc39440cc5f6a2717

"I went for a driving lesson when I was sixteen years old. In my town, the driving lesson had to be 3 separate days of driving for two hours at a time. My driver was very cool and relaxed. Driving for the first time is a very nervous experience so it was good to have such a laid back guy as my instructor. It helped to put all of the worries to rest. I was very nervous at first. But we started driving around town and I got more used to it. In the instructor's car, they have pedals on their side of the car as well. So that is a comfort knowing that they can take control of the car if anything goes wrong. That really helped to make me worry a lot less.

"I went out to eat at a restaurant last weekend with my husband. We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but soon enough we were seated. The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel, and our waiter appeared right after we were seated. She was warm and friendly too. She greeted us and asked for our drink orders. My husband just wanted water, but I got an unsweet tea with lemon. We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on. We ordered our entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. Our waitress took the order, then promised to have our food out soon. We sampled the bread while she was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving, which we are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong. The smell was off and it had a bad taste. I thought it must be bad. I waited until our waitress was coming back by, then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different, because I felt like the salmon was going bad. She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. He said his was delicious. The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely. She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic. She kept checking on us throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert. He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. It was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed our meal, overall. Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal.

"I went to the Dallas Museum of Art yesterday. It was so much fun. I took my friend Becky. She loves art. When we got there we bought our tickets. I liked the big entrance with all types of art all around. First we went to the painting area. There were many paintings. We could have spent the whole day looking at all the paintings and talking about them. One painting had a lady in front of a house. It looked simple, but my friend Becky explained the painting to me.

"I went to the dentist yesterday. I brushed my teeth first, because dentists like that, and I left in plenty of time, so I wouldn't be late. When I got to the office, I told the man behind the counter who I was, and that I had an appointment with Dr. Tsutaoka. He told me to have a seat. I sat in the waiting room and watched the television a while. Soon, a woman came and led me back to a small room with a big padded chair. She had me sit in the chair, and tucked a sort of paper napkin around my neck. Then the dentist came in and smiled and said hi. She asked how I was feeling, and I said I was fine. She told me she was just going to look at my teeth, and she did. She pushed a button and the chair whirred and slowly tilted back. I opened wide, and she looked at my teeth one by one, using a small round mirror on a thin metal stick to see them. She said everything looked good, and I should keep brushing and flossing. I told her I would. She was nice, and I'll see her again in six months.",412b0fa6ad406680bf5b1e9feaec55fd,Did they get to the dentist's office on time?,"Yes, they did.","Yes, they got a visit.",gpt2,40004e3f85cd34fd5894e2636e970fe4,Did they get to the dentist's office on time?,"Yes, they did.",Yes,gpt2,a97f0a9efa55247dd858a3a50cf11e9e,Did they get to the dentist's office on time?,"Yes, they did.",Not when their teeth were crusted,gpt2,bdc770d1884d5bb5538b07ff157f035e,What was the dentist's name?,Dr. Tsutaoka,Tsutaoka,gpt2,4cb464e8507c56f0c87386dd28442d88,Where did they wait before the appointment?,In the waiting room.,Around 6 a.m.. with normal shifts,gpt2,ee65120d8b33384a193974ab69c2efb5,What was the dentist's name?,Dr. Tsutaoka,Tsutakaoka,gpt2,92fac38d54800f66f4c04d6c9d6d94f0,What was the dentist's name?,Dr. Tsutaoka,Todaoka,gpt2,68288d2fbe67d9ce24c2be15a96e093a,Who went to the dentist?,The author.,The story teller.,gpt2,cdf06f8b3f03df46cbffcdc58a25e46d,Who went to the dentist?,The author.,Mr Tsutaoka,gpt2,a82c7bb539ea13ae39cb6509bd134519,Where did they wait before the appointment?,In the waiting room.,to sit in the chair,gpt2,98869e7cd67f4657c656669df48e489c

"I went to the swimming pool at the local YMCA recently. I decided to go towards 1 PM since there would be less people there. I do not like sharing a lane. Even though sharing is caring, I find it to be crowded in the pool and distracting sharing a lane. I drove to the YMCA, about 15 minutes. I then parked my car and went inside. I then changed into my bathing suit. I proceeded to swim for about 35 minutes. Mostly just the front crawl, and back stroke. I also used the kicking board for about 200 meters or 4 laps of a 50 meter pool. Finally, I finished my swim. This YMCA has a hot tub so I then soaked in the hot tub for a half hour to relax my muscles.

I woke up this morning and when I turned on the bathroom light switch I noticed that one of the bulbs popped and burned out. I checked the closet where I normally keep light bulbs and could not find any. I removed the bulb to see what size I needed and made myself a note on a post it. On my way to work I stopped at the grocery store and bought a pack of replacement bulbs. When I got home from work I opened the new package of bulbs and carefully screwed the new bulb in. It immediately lit up when the contacts connected. Figuring that the other three bulbs were the same age and would probably blow out soon I decided to change the rest of them.

I make sure to note the time and I leave in about ten minutes even though it only takes seven minutes to drive there. I want to browse the store and buy some chips and soda too. While I'm looking at soda I see my favorite key lime pie flavored soda, it's expensive, but I don't care, because I deserve it. Before the full thirty minutes has passed I see the kitchen staff slide a large pizza box onto the counter clearly labeled ""Hawaiian"" I make my way to the counter with my chips and soda and proceed to pay the cashier using my debit card.

"I'm feeling thirsty. Fortunately, there's a vending machine that I can get a drink from here. Vending machines are special machines that automatically sell things like food, drinks, and other little things. Today, I'm going to buy a bottle of water from this machine. The first thing I do is put in my money. I put in one dollar, the price of the bottle I want. Then, I put in the number for the water. Every item in the machine has its own number, which you punch into a special pad to order it. Once I press the number, the machine pushes the bottle of water down, where it falls into a slot where I can pick it up from. Some machines instead grab the bottle and carry it down gently, especially of it carries bottles made from glass.

After I sprayed my homemade solution around the shower I let it sit for around an hour. After an hour, I grabbed a scrubbing brush and began to scrub away all the mildew stains that were in the shower. I find it best that you have the bathroom well-ventilated when you start scrubbing because you don't want to inhale all those nasty chemicals when your scrubbing away at your shower.

I carefully took the tea kettle off of the stove, being cautious not to burn myself.  I slowly poured the water into the tea cup and let the bag soak in the hot water.

I think it needed some more oil. I but a bit of oil in and it started right up. I mowed in rows as I usually do. There were several sticks on the ground I had to pick up.

"It is Sunday. I am woken up rather violently by my elder brother, he enjoys this sort of thing, I don't. I asked him why he woke me up this early on a school holiday. He didn't answer and  just gave me a grin.  I tend to sleep till late on the days I don't have school. He said dad told him to and he had work for me. I immediately knew what it meant. I had to go and help him tend the gardens. I was still half- asleep when I reached our garden. And there I saw my dad with a shovel in his one hand and a little plant on the other. As soon as he saw me his eye gleamed. I kid you not his eyes literally gave me a sparkle. He came over to the door and handed me the shovel and the plant. He said since I was 11 I'm a big boy and have to help him and mom around the house and that of course includes gardening. My dad doesn't mind the dirt , but I do.

Too much caffeine is bad though and can make you feel nervous. I make sure to only drink coffee every now and then to stay healthy. Coffee is made from pouring hot water on coffee beans, and a coffee maker does this for you. I make sure that the coffee maker has enough water in it, and put coffee beans that have been smashed up into the top. The coffee is easier to make when the beans are smashed up, so people normally smash the beans into grounds.

"It was Friday, finally the precious weekend after a grueling long week of work  had arrived. I knew it would be a waste of precious time to go home and change so I brought a change of clothes with me to the office. I freshened up and changed in the office bathroom. I am so lucky they have a actual shower in here. So me and my friends had already decided which pub we'd hit this week, it was ""The Hive"". It was named so because it was always ""buzzing"" with people . Stupid or clever? I don't know. So the four of us , Clay , Justin , Tony and myself had to reach the pub by 8:00. I pulled up my phone to book a cab. First I opened ""ola"" the app took a lot of time to load probably because the internet speed was slow. After a minute the app finally opened and show no cabs around. Then I opened ""Uber"" it loaded almost instantly and there were cabs available near me but due to high demand it had surge pricing(more than usual rate).

"It was a Monday evening in a warm July heat wave. My wife and I had just completed a particularly tasty meal that I had prepared for the both of us. We were both very full and sat in momentary silence as we pondered the situation in front of us.

Mom laid down on a towel while dad went running to the ocean. We swam but not too far because the water was very deep. There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards. There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles. Dad helped us build our sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in it would fill in our pool. At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water. There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguard had to blow his whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach. I have heard that sometimes you can see shark in the ocean but lucky for us we did not see any sharks. Visiting the beach was very fun for the whole family as mom can relax and get a tan and dad could play and swim with us.",1f77b23c628ff97cf46f2d9683c0288c,Did they ride the waves?,no,Yes,gpt2,0c27239b9ceb838e30c234caf46e1347,How did they keep lunch cold?,probably with a cooler,They kept their cooler in the cooler.,gpt2,b187468a295d01313a53572c55e1fda0,Did they bring food?,yes,No food.,gpt2,e97dbc05b29dc5998c79f9e048690bbb,Did they sunbathe?,yes,No,gpt2,a0e2bce87deec3809da8fdc0ce429ecc,How did they keep lunch cold?,probably with a cooler,They packed lunch.,gpt2,16fcef4253bd9306faa7f2172ac72e73,Did they sunbathe?,yes,"Yes, they swam",gpt2,40564af605601143e1979557195b7437,Did they sunbathe?,yes,Yes Yes,backtranslation,585b624f1ed613d365af0752f6ae3a9f,How did they keep lunch cold?,probably with a cooler,They had some snacks.,gpt2,a33de0011b10cecfa966bf64781e5b17,Did they bring food?,yes,Yes Yes,backtranslation,11a7d578dcb61f4aee706dfb8a0bb095,Did they ride the waves?,no,none,backtranslation,ff2524ca7cf22496c048cd3014401d6a

We decided to decorate everything while he was at work so he wouldn't see. Then, we planned what kinds of activities we wanted to have at the party. We decided to get a piñata, some fun water balloon games for our backyard, and of course, a big cake for everyone to share. On the big day, we decorated our house and once my roommate got there, everyone hid in their places to jump out and surprise him. We yelled ""surprise!"" and my roommate was so shocked!

"It was summertime and I was very thirsty. I wanted to drink orange juice very badly, but I did not have any orange juice. Luckily I had an orange tree in my backyard.

"It was the first warm sunny weekend in May, so I was excited to head up into the mountains and camp. I checked through my camping box to make sure I had camp stove fuel, batteries for the flashlights, camp utensils, bug spray and everything else I might need. I also double checked to make sure all the stakes and poles were with my tent. Lastly I loaded up a cooler with food and snacks. I rounded up the kids and we got into the car. We drove half an hour away on the highway before turning onto a Forest Service Road. After about 15 minutes we pulled into a campground. We selected a spot, looking for one that was well shaded and set back from the road. The kids took the tent out and began putting poles together. I helped them stake out the tent. Then we gathered up firewood together and placed it in the fire ring. I got some matches from the box and lit some of the smaller twigs. I poked around the fire until it began to burn well and then started to get out some food for dinner.",bac79098727630097828d787f2920344,How did they pick this area?,They wanted to go to a campsite,They picked it.,gpt2,d0789349f120fae348b53643a9bc5a4c,How long did it take to get to the campground?,About 45 minutes,Around 15 minutes,gpt2,3aa0e3face7840e8bed85d3591b12a6d,Why did they choose that location for the trip?,They wanted a spot that was well shaded and set back from the road.,It's a hiking destination and they wanted to enjoy the summer,gpt2,3acf150e828632bd236f2db04e6be7a1,Why did they choose that location for the trip?,They wanted a spot that was well shaded and set back from the road.,"The mountains are warm, and weather is nice",gpt2,29ef33eb0ffee6ca84ac15922077ca40,How long did it take to get to the campground?,About 45 minutes,15 minutes,gpt2,fafb708c2a87856326303e574795fe69,Why did they choose that location for the trip?,They wanted a spot that was well shaded and set back from the road.,It was a nice place to camp.,gpt2,a028e20de35e047c67c47c9bb886bfdb,Why did they choose that location for the trip?,They wanted a spot that was well shaded and set back from the road.,the narrator was well,mhpg,875bcfe8bc79b5e4d3e8c86013abde32,How did they pick this area?,They wanted to go to a campsite,they were going to go to the mountains,gpt2,b0a758fc161a29f72ce7286e4a660c08,How did they pick this area?,They wanted to go to a campsite,Grocery store,gpt2,9acc412ee3b01c0dc3cbabf04429759c,How long did it take to get to the campground?,About 45 minutes,10 minutes,gpt2,f2f957d5a22554c92f819077686af108

John was getting ready to move into a new house. He was excited but needed to do some work on the house before he could actually move in. He decided he wanted to replace the carpets in the living room of his new house so he stripped the old carpet of the living room with his buddies that were there to help him. He pulled up the carpet and got rid of it and made sure the floor was okay. It was fine to work with so he got the padding for the room out of his truck and brought it into the living room. He padded down the floor with his friends. He put it down across the entire room and proceeded to get the carpet out of his truck now. He brought the carpet in with his friends and placed it down across the entire room.

"Judy came home and walked past the bathroom. She noticed the shower was looking a little grimy. Going straight to the kitchen, she grabbed everything she would need to deep clean the shower. A bucket, a sponge, shower cleaner, a baggie for trash, a scrubbing pad, and a large bucket. Going in, she started by running the shower on very hot to wet down the whole shower area. Being careful not to burn herself, she waved the shower head back and forth to get all the corners wet. Then, she sprayed the shower cleaner all over the shower and organized her counter while she waited a few minutes to let it soak in. Using the sponge, she scrubbed and scrubbed to get all the build up off. She then turned the shower back on and rinsed all the tile and the fixtures, using the sponge now and again to spread the water around. She put all the debris in the baggie, and threw it away in the kitchen.

""Kevin,: I yelled as I got to the front door, ""Don't forget to bring the big cooler over in the car when you get up and around. My husband Kevin had just had surgery on his back, and it took him a lot longer to get up and around. He definitely couldn't make the quarter of a mile trek down to Katie and Jesse's. Though, I was pretty sure he liked going to the parties the neighbors threw even more that the kids did. ""I called over to Katie, and she said that they have all the meat there already, so no need for you to drag yourself off to the grocery. Just rest, and I'll see you there. I love you. I'll save you a cheeseburger,"" I teased as I kissed him goodbye. He grinned at me and beeped my nose, ""I love you Sally Jean,: He said with an exaggerated southern drawl. He then turned and gave our four young boys the evil eye, ""I expect you to be good and eat lots of hamburgers and hot dogs at the barbecue."" They all nodded in unison and screamed, ""Hamburgers!"" like wild Indians. I love going to eat others peoples food, and let my kids make a mess somewhere that I don't have to clean it up.",877d17efe73bd9f00b0ab773098df449,Where was the barbecue held?,At the neighbors' house,At the house,gpt2,7c4505b0acd175829cef736f6119a1c0,Who was doing the BBQ?,Katie and Jesse,The narrator and the kids,gpt2,db94d88c31aa36643baecf126543a3a6,who's holding the barbecue?,Katie & Jesse,No one,gpt2,b142d6e312b230195d73c2d5f33f688f,What type of food was barbecued?,burgers and other meats,hamburgers and hot dogs,gpt2,ab4d7e70faf768fbabed27fcbd7fc848,Where was the barbecue held?,At the neighbors' house,in the house,mhpg,313e14f81c1156ada65324152a1cb615,Where was the barbecue held?,At the neighbors' house,Katie's house,gpt2,f3404c3a490c971044d3693b7b62ce37,who's holding the barbecue?,Katie & Jesse,the author,gpt2,715dcf57cfb2d9a93d82eefa51e673c1,What type of food was barbecued?,burgers and other meats,Meat and potatoes,gpt2,5b4d8e14a936961cdd23a54457aab330,Where was the barbecue held?,At the neighbors' house,Reading room,gpt2,f7b371f6cfe3b48fe05d75b9dbf0446d,What type of food was barbecued?,burgers and other meats,Meat.,gpt2,e919900d09d5a30fb2f2747c37fe2f5e
"Keeping a clean bathroom to me is an important part of good hygiene. This is something that I had to do just recently.

I realized she was right-- the weeds were growing pretty tall, and I hadn't cut the grass in weeks. I decided it was time to mow the lawn the next day. I went to the garage to find my lawnmower. I rolled the lawnmower over to the lawn, and then turned the lawnmower on. It started roaring, signaling that it was on and ready to cut grass. I mowed the grass in neat rows, starting on one side of my lawn and mowing all the way to the other side. I made sure not to miss any patches by going back and forth with the mowing machine.

"Last Saturday, my friend and I went to the movie theater together. We had been meaning to go to the movie theater for a long time, since have both been anticipating the release of the smash hit ""La La Land"" for months. La La Land is now finally in theaters, and my friend and I decided that the weekend would be the perfect time to see it. We went to the theater about 30 minutes before the movie started in order to purchase our tickets. We both got adult tickets for the movie. We then waited in line at the concessions stand, because we wanted to buy sodas, popcorn, and candy. My friend bought a Coke and a large popcorn, as well as a bag of Skittles. I bought a Pepsi, a medium popcorn, and a box of Mike & Ikes. After we got our concessions, we went to the movie auditorium. The movie was just about to start as we got to our seats.

"Last Tuesday was another typical workday. Following my daily 1:00 meeting, I was struck with some hunger pains. I reached into my pocket and felt around - fortunately I had some spare change. I stood up from my desk with a smile on my face and started to make my way down the hall. It was the perfect time for an afternoon snack. What would I want? There were so many options. I could opt for something healthy, maybe a granola or a kind bar. Or maybe, perhaps, it was the perfect time to indulge in some chocolate. On the other hand, I could always play it safe and get some popcorn or even some potato chips. I arrived at the vending machine and glanced at my options. Fully stocked! What luck!

"Last night we had some special guests for dinner. I and my brother helped our mother to set the dining table. First we cleaned the table well. Then we spread a clean table cloth and put an attractive flower vase in the middle. We arranged the vase with fresh, beautiful flowers. Now comes the arrangement of plates. We placed dinner plates, small plates and glasses for drinks for each chair count. Then we arranged spoons on the left hand side and forks on the right hand side of the plates. Then we neatly folded dining napkins and kept near each plate. A stand filled with extra spoons and forks was also kept in the middle of the table. A separate stand with tissue papers were also placed. We sprayed mild air freshner under the table so that our guests could get good fragrance during the dinner time.

Last night we went out with friends and needed to take a taxi home. First off we needed to find an available taxi. Once we found one we all hopped inside the taxi. We told the taxi cab driver where we wanted to go. There was a lot of traffic so it took a long while to get back to our hotel. Once we were at our hotel the taxi driver let us know what our total for the ride was. It came out to $15.00. My husband decided he would pay for it since some friends paid for our last round of drinks. We paid the taxi driver and all exited the taxi.

"Last night, I ordered pizza for dinner. Pizza is one of my favorite foods. I had a couple of friends over, so we decided to order two pizzas in order to feed all of us. My friends and I couldn't agree on which toppings we wanted, so we decided to get one pizza that was half cheese, half pepperoni, and another pizza that was half veggie, half sausage. We looked up the phone number to our nearby pizza place by searching the Internet. We then put a call in and spoke with the hostess, who took our order.

"Last night, I watched a movie at home with my daughter. At 8pm when the movie was over, I turned the TV off because it was time to get ready for bed. First we went into the bathroom. I started running the bath while my daughter undressed. I put bubble bath in the water and helped my daughter step into the bathtub. After about 10 minutes, it was time for her to get out of the tub. I gave her a towel to dry off with and helped her get into her pajamas. After she brushed her teeth, we went to the bedroom. I tucked my daughter into the bed so that she was nice and warm and comfortable under the blankets. I sang a lullaby to her and then turned off the lights, leaving only a nightlight on.

"Last week I went bowling to celebrate my friend's birthday. The bowling alley was called Barney's Bowl-o-rama. When we got to the bowling alley we all went up to the counter at the front of the building to pay the fee and get our bowling shoes. I told the attendant my shoe size and he handed over my shoes, then I handed him the money. After we had all gotten our shoes we headed over to the lane that we had been assigned. Everyone put on their shoes and walked over to the ball storage rack to select our bowling balls. I picked a purple ball and my friend picked a pink one. Someone else picked a green one! After everyone had their balls we sat down to figure out the order in which we would bowl. We all wrote our names down on the scorecard and I was assigned to be the person to keep score. We had a great night taking turns bowling, and my friend had the highest score at the end! When we were done, we all turned in our shoes at the counter, said goodbye, and went home to eat dinner.",9055406d61a536db90db5c6f9262765d,What the occasion for which they went bowling?,to celebrate their friend's birthday,Friends' birthday,gpt2,fef5f837264a0138197320a4242f96c1,What the occasion for which they went bowling?,to celebrate their friend's birthday,Their friend's birthday,gpt2,60688582c3dc9a8ebfbe6fef86e9a09f,What the occasion for which they went bowling?,to celebrate their friend's birthday,to celebrate birthdays at all,backtranslation,28755c8e9bdbd31d23c353e9f6428f54,What the occasion for which they went bowling?,to celebrate their friend's birthday,friend's birthday,mhpg,2ce34c718a84124a114d8f11466eb33a,When did they go bowling?,in the evening before dinner,on the birthday of their friend,gpt2,a1ba89ee3517d98620ec06c2d2467354,When did they go bowling?,in the evening before dinner,After friend's birthday,gpt2,f2f2a31228869a84cd97134ae79da424,When did they go bowling?,in the evening before dinner,night before dinner,backtranslation,f57c03338acdfcd68829bcdf5eb92f4c,When did they go bowling?,in the evening before dinner,Sunday,gpt2,a4be65cb013d3e39c785fd919dbf7b68,When did they go bowling?,in the evening before dinner,after they went home,mhpg,15cac9a3742921f145e336367cd7c933,What the occasion for which they went bowling?,to celebrate their friend's birthday,Birthday,gpt2,c61f7884988312a88424330bb086a212
"Last week I went to an art museum.  I got there early in the day so that I would have lots of time to look at everything.  The museum had many kinds of art.  There were paintings and drawings.  There were ceramics.  There were sculptures.  I went to see the paintings first.  There were some paintings by famous artists.  Other paintings were by artists I had never heard of.  I enjoyed the paintings of still life, such as flowers and fruit.  Next I went to see the ceramics display.  Some of the pottery was over 1,000 years old.  The designs on the pottery were detailed and very pretty.  Some of the pieces were brightly colored and others were brown and beige.  Some of the pottery was damaged and pieces were missing. There was some Chinese pottery and it had colorful dragons painted on it.   I enjoyed looking at all of the different styles and designs.  Finally I went to see the sculptures.  I liked the sculptures of horses.  There was a sculpture of a man riding on a horse that I particularly liked.  The man was an Indian and was wearing only pants and a feather in his hair.  He had a fierce expression on his face. It was easy to imagine him riding into battle on his horse.

There were many people there, including lots of children with their parents and some adults alone or with friends. Shortly after we arrived, we put on suntan lotion and took a dip in the pool. It was just the right temperature. Cool, but not too cold. We swam around for a bit and then got out and laid on our towels for a while. We relaxed in the sun and had a nice chat about what was going on in our lives while we ate some snacks.

"Last week when I took a trip into the city I had to ride on the underground to get from one place to another. There are stations all around the city, so I had to find the one that was closest to my destination so I wouldn't have to walk too far after I got off. When I got to the station, I walked down the stairs that led into the underground and went over to the kiosk so I could pay my fee.

"Last weekend , I took the train into the city with my younger brother to attend a concert . We drove to the train station to catch the 4 PM train . It took a while to find parking . Once we boarded the train , we took a seat . The train conductor came by and we purchased 2 round trip tickets with cash . The ride to the city took about an hour . Many people got on and off at every stop . I enjoyed the people watching . There were many different types of people , the business types , students , families , and coeds .

"Last weekend I invited a bunch of my friends over to my house for a barbecue that started around 4 in the afternoon. I was going to cook some chicken and steaks that I had for whoever wanted them, but my friends were also going to bring some of their own food to cook as well. My barbecue grill is in my backyard. Before cooking I put several pieces of hickory wood at the bottom of the grill with some small sticks and paper to get the pieces of wood burning. A few minutes after catching fire the flames went out but the wood turned white and stayed really hot. That's when I knew its was time to start cooking the meat. Throughout the day me and my friends would keep putting food on and off the grill for whoever was hungry while everyone else was either hanging around outside or staying inside to stay out of the heat.

"Last weekend, my friend and I decided it would be a good time to paper our living room. The previous residents of the house we live in had used wallpaper on the living room walls that was a very odd shade of red, which we thought looked strange. We wanted the living room to get a new color of wallpaper, and we wanted to choose a color that would match our personality. We first went to Sherwin-Williams, which is a paint and wallpaper store. We looked at the wallpaper color samples and picked up a few brochures with examples of how the samples would look on our walls. We decided that a cheery yellow color would look best on our walls, and selected that color. We then returned to Sherwin-Williams and purchased the yellow wallpaper. We then applied the wallpaper to our walls and stood back to admire our work.",aff7a40fe31ca81866dea39017e6d87c,Who will be helping with the papering?,Author and friend,They used a narrator and their friend.,gpt2,9069c273692973b0736de296841ab5a0,Which room did they paper?,the living room,Their living room,gpt2,5cd36006fa8e5f3d2ecd5297b5d1344a,Who did the work?,Author and friend,Author,gpt2,12b29ffdd778c5e78b144f416474ab78,Who did the work?,Author and friend,The narrator,gpt2,9037a5194d25d57447cb3430144a432a,Who will be helping with the papering?,Author and friend,no one,gpt2,8ebbd2adde47201b41668393cbe70593,Who will be helping with the papering?,Author and friend,Nobody will help you,gpt2,b9e508c6d267b5ba700ec7834951243a,Who papered the room?,they and their friend did,The narrator,gpt2,92b04c2d761153167faa7e37103f6b5d,Is it in their house?,yes,no,gpt2,8b5ca38615f6ff278920826aed8db945,Is it in their house?,yes,Yes it is currently,gpt2,bb32b58df27b71761a867d3ff9da3d48,Who papered the room?,they and their friend did,sister,gpt2,0d40d04a043a32aa3fbafd23c3ef889d

"Last year on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, I went to my friend Eric's wedding with my partner. The wedding was outside on the Art Institute terrace at 10am. When I arrived at the wedding, I was greeted by Eric's parents who were very nice, friendly, and welcoming. Once my partner and I found our seats, we said hello to our friends and also met some new people. After about a half an hour of socializing, it was time for the ceremony to begin.

"Last year, when  I threw a party for my girlfriends birthday, I prepared a nice party with family and friends both excited. My first task was finding a day that would work and trying to be discrete about it. This was difficult because we are both busy and also because I had to alert both of our friends to invite while making sure that none of them gave away the secret. I also had to figure out how I was going to get my girlfriend to the party without telling her that we were having a party for her. After establishing all of these details, I planned the party and sent invites, planned the food, and planned some gifts. This experience was good, but was somewhat difficult . As a the party went on, my girlfriend enjoyed it and appreciated my effort.

"Making a bed in a hotel as a cleaning maid consists of stripping off the linens. The blanket  & cover are not washed unless really bad. The linens are picked up for the laundry. There are two flat sheets. The first flat sheet is spread across the bed and tucked tightly using a special fold so it won't undo itself. The send flat sheet is spread out, then the blanket.  Folding the top edge over the blanket, both are tuck between the mattress and spring board. Pillows  are put into clean pillow sacks and the top cover is laid over and tucked under the pillows. Some motels put a mint chocolate on the pillow but most don't. A real fancy hotel would have a flat sheet on top of the blanket as well as below it because that isn't washed everyday.

I have to assume it must be the batteries. I take the old batteries out of the alarm clock and look them over for corrosion. They look fine, so maybe they are just old. I place the new batteries in the alarm clock and I make sure they make contact with the metal parts and face the right direction. Check. I slide the back of the alarm clock back on and flip the clock over. I turn the on switch on and it lights up.

"My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish. Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market.  When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up.  When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones. Some of the fish he buys still has the head, fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too. The head of the fish is really good to make fish soup. I like it better when he leaves the scales (skin) of the fish as it tastes really good. There are many different ways that he cooks the fish. Sometimes he will  fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it.  He also bakes the fish in the oven which makes it soft and tender. My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi.  In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it.  My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain.",2fc28f6ff515cb806b67861e5d160aec,Who is cooking the fish?,his dad,dad at home,gpt2,1434e9ecbb5d17841151475cc25224e1,Why did they use the oven?,bake fish,It's convenient,gpt2,627135c342d3bb560f47cbbf45048fb0,Why did they use the oven?,bake fish,Mom ordered the fish cooking the pan and the oven.,gpt2,8ccd2eab7b1e74ff036239a356199829,Why did they use the oven?,bake fish,it was dirty,mhpg,baba1a8df02028012fc7a87823697fa0,Who is cooking the fish?,his dad,Mom,gpt2,f94f31531d04e752036190337523221d,how many people helped cook the fish?,0,No one helped,gpt2,0c09b8d3088ceece926bcd49bd29e42f,why were they cooking fish?,hungry,They like it,gpt2,d4431d865420d280d51930a5c169ff11,how many people helped cook the fish?,0,3 people helped cook it,gpt2,dad435d296d90c6a90e9299b84362e41,Who is cooking the fish?,his dad,Dad,gpt2,f8093391ca9a8b23ea6680c84f6416d8,how many people helped cook the fish?,0,Speaker's,gpt2,db31732475d4a45d7030e3771562aa92

"My daughter's 10th birthday was coming up in about a month. My husband and I had decided to throw her a party because she was so excited to turn 10 years old. We planned some entertainment for the party and agreed on the food and treats to be served. Then it was time to invite all of her friends to the party. We made a list of her friends with her help. We then looked online for invitations and found a great selection. We let our daughter pick her favorite and ordered 30 of them. When the invitations came we filled out the names for each then addressed the envelopes with only names so that she could hand the invitations out at school.

"My family and I decided that the evening was beautiful so we wanted to have a bonfire.  First, my husband went to our shed and gathered some dry wood.  I placed camp chairs around our fire pit.  Then my husband placed the dry wood in a pyramid shape inside the fire pit.  He then set some small kindling ablaze using a long lighter.  Once the kindling reached the dry wood, it set the wood on fire.  We then sat around the fire for some time, adding more logs as the previous ones burned out.

"My family and I decided that the evening was beautiful so we wanted to have a bonfire.  First, my husband went to our shed and gathered some dry wood.  I placed camp chairs around our fire pit.  Then my husband placed the dry wood in a pyramid shape inside the fire pit.  He then set some small kindling ablaze using a long lighter.  Once the kindling reached the dry wood, it set the wood on fire.  We then sat around the fire for some time, adding more logs as the previous ones burned out.

"My friend , Tom , had moved into a new house , and decided to plant a small tree to help make his yard look better . He had been advised by a tree expert , that the best time to plant it was in April or May . So about several weeks after Tom had moved into his new home , he went ahead to plant the tree in mid April . He first got and checked some maps to make sure he did n't mistakenly end up digging into any telephone or gas lines . Once he found a suitable spot to plant his new tree , Tom took a shovel and began preparing the hole to place it in . Next , he prepared the tree for planting by turning carefully upside down to remove it from the pot it came in . He then gently , placed the tree into the hole . Tom also filled the hole with some compost and manure to help the tree grow better . Once this was done , he filled up the hole completely and watered the tree . Finally , he placed mulch on top and then stopped to admire the beautiful new tree in his yard .",4e2b86fa81b6d0171099f0eb8a5d4964,Was the tree a tree or just seeds?,a sapling,It was a planting,gpt2,ee42e4474d849e86d0db8041381cf186,Was the tree a tree or just seeds?,a sapling,Seeds,gpt2,fb5a0acd2ee3c9d03cd60d7f71ebbe76,Why was the tree planted?,to improve the looks of the yard,Because the neighbors noticed it growing.,gpt2,c8e78c22272a3e0219b059ad4a023bb1,When did they finish planting the tree?,That same day,In the spring,gpt2,092f84ea1f41db962bda2f7124af1b72,When did they finish planting the tree?,That same day,after showing them signs of watering,gpt2,1fd158fb4e436c245e76f6814d1b67f0,Why was the tree planted?,to improve the looks of the yard,it was dirty,mhpg,68b69832b8ff0e5c057e88dea4314315,Why did they want to plant the tree?,To make Tom's yard look nicer,It was a new house,gpt2,f6fb77cb91a62d6d19ad7e725226e8cb,Was the tree a tree or just seeds?,a sapling,Yes,gpt2,6a9142afdf06fa728b20cb4a6d48f14b,Why was the tree planted?,to improve the looks of the yard,"They like to grow trees, and their Friends",gpt2,9baeda91efb843ee9f22152a508ff246,Why was the tree planted?,to improve the looks of the yard,Tom liked to plant it,gpt2,b6db4110a1b0053d4949eb3e800eb9d9
"My friend Mary and I went bowling last night.  First we looked up bowling alleys online to see which places were closest.  We picked one that was close to my house.  When we got to the bowling alley it was pretty crowded and we had to wait in line to get a lane.  We bought two games and rented some shoes.  Mary and I entered our names in the computer at the bowling lane so that we could keep score. We both got to pick out balls from a rack.  After we did that, we started bowling.

"My friend Thomas was going out of town and asked if I could feed his fish. I said I would of course. Getting into his building was more the challenge. I had to sign in with the front desk, designate my parking place and give my license plate before the door man would let me in the building. I cross the lobby and head upstairs. As I enter the apartment, I see the fish tank. They look happy and very active. The sun is shining in through a window across the room and there is a table next to the tank with a container of fish food. I read the container to make sure I understand the instruction. Thomas said to give the fish two nice size pinches of food. You can't give them too much or it will sink and make the water murky. I try to get just the right amount.

"My friend and I left our hotel early, about 6:30. The walk took about fifteen minutes to the station. We had to walk down a long flight of stairs down to the station. We took out our automatic payment cards, walked up to the barrier, and swiped them across the electronic reader. The barrier opened to let us in. We walked up to the map that shows how the different train lines run. We confirmed that we would have to change trains halfway there. We looked at the signs to locate the platform we needed, and walked down another flight of steps to catch our train. We waited on the platform at a safe distance until the train came roaring in. After it came to a stop and the other passengers got off, we entered the train. It was mostly empty and we were able to find seats. At the third stop we got off and quickly walked up another flight of steps to locate the platform for the next train. In two minutes our next train arrived and we got on.

"My friends and I decided to go bowling a few weeks ago. We met up at the local bowling alley around 6PM and walked inside together. The place was packed, but we managed to find a free lane and sat down. A few of us went up to the counter to pay for a few games for each person. We each then went up to the rental counter to rent some bowling shoes. We each gave the attendant out sizes, and she was able to find the right shoes for each of us on one of the many shelves of shoes. We went back to our lane and sat down to put our shoes on. We then each selected a bowling ball that was the right weight for us. I programmed the computer for our lane so that each of our names showed on the screen above us. We each rolled our balls down the lane, taking two turns at a time. None of us did very well, but we still had fun knocking down pins and catching up.

We had to call and speak to the park ranger and arrange a spot to set up camp.Once we did, we began to plan the rest. We had to make sure we had the right equipment. We purchased a tent that was big enough for all of us and enough sleeping bags to sleep us all. We took some cast iron skillets from the kitchen, so we could cook with them.

"My girlfriend and I decided that we wanted to do something different for a date night tonight.  We looked through possible things to do in the area, and decided on dancing at a swing dancing club.  We got dressed in some nice, but easy to move in clothes, got in the car, and drove to the club.  We had a couple of drinks at the bar while watching the others dance on the dance floor  before joining them ourselves.  When we got on the floor, we danced together, doing spins and dips in time with the music coming from the stage.  We would take breaks in between some songs to cool off and get drinks, before heading back out for more dancing.  Eventually, there was a dancing competition, and we lasted for two rounds before getting eliminated, but we didn't mind, since we had a great time.

"My hair is dirty and feels oily when I touch it today, so it is time to wash it. I like washing my hair in the shower because it is much easier than in a bath tub. I turn the shower on and make sure the water is nice and warm, but not too hot. I step in the shower and get my hair nice and wet. It is good to use shampoo and conditioner. First, I take some shampoo that I like and rub it onto my head. This cleans the part of the hair that is close to your head and also cleans the skin there that gets oily. After the shampoo is rubbed into my head, I let the water from the shower rinse out all the soap. Once the soap is out, I take some conditioner and rub it into the longer parts of my hair and the ends. This keeps it nice and soft and healthy.

"My husband and I decided that while our son was off at college it would be a good time to renovate his room. It still had cartoony race car trim up and the carpet had seen better days.

The first time we did was move everything out of the room.  Next, we went to the store and picked out paint.  We painted the walls a beautiful blue and then we had to pick out new flooring.  We decided on hardwood floors.  We ordered the wood, but had to hire a contractor to put the flooring in since we couldn't do it ourselves.  The contractor came in and had the job done within a day.  Once that was done, we put up new curtains and brought in new home décor.  We put the furniture back into the living room and added different personalized touches like pictures to make the room just right.

I inserted the keys into the ignition and using my thumb and first finger pushed the switch forward. I checked the mirrors again to make sure all people, animals, and objects where out of the way. I pulled the gear shift towards me and pulled down one click going from P (park) to R (reverse). I check the mirrors once more and turned my head to the right to look over my shoulder to back out of the driveway.

"My parents said it was okay to start dating as long as it was a double date with my older sister who would, in essence chaperon me.

"My son needed his diaper changed just a few hours ago. I noticed that his diaper had a distinct smell and felt full, so I carried him back to his changing table.

"My stomach woke me up this morning. It was rumbling so loud, at first I thought it was an earthquake! I jumped out of bed and ran to the kitchen. I knew that I was going to need something that would fill my empty stomach up, so I decided to make an omelette. I opened the fridge and grabbed a carton of eggs and some mixed vegetables I chopped up last night. Then I opened the cabinet to get a bowl to mix my eggs in. I scrambled the eggs up with a fork, and then got a pan to put on the stove to cook the eggs in. After I turned on the stove, I put some a little bit of oil in the pan so the eggs wouldn't stick. I hate when that happens, it always makes cleaning up after really hard! Then I poured the eggs from the bowl into the pan and waited for the eggs to start to firm up. I poked at them with a spatula, pushing parts from the edge of the pan that were kinda firm slowly towards the middle of the pan. The uncooked runny eggs slide over to where the firm eggs were and cook up really quick! When there was no more runny eggs left, I turned off the stove and spread my mixed veggies on one side of the omelette. Then I used my spatula to fold the omelette in half so that the mixed veggies were in between the sides of the omelette, kind of like a sandwich.

"My table has gotten all sticky from dinner, so it is time to clean it. Cleaning the table helps make the table last longer and keep bugs out, so it is good to do. Some tables can be cleaned with a wet rag, but some tables are especially dirty so they need cleaning chemicals. My table is really dirty and made of stone so I find a good cleaning spray to use on it. The spray I chose is good for stone and doesn't hurt it, and it also gets rid of the stickiness and dirt on the table. I spray the table with not too much of the chemical, and then use some paper towels to rub the table. I make sure I rub the whole table and rub off any dirt or stickiness.

"My wife and I decided to have a picnic with my sister and brother-in-law.  We picked out a park to go to because it had a pavilion we could sit under to enjoy the weather.  My wife and I planned to make a salad that had avocado and peppers in it.  My sister said that she would bring pizza and a dessert.  We prepared the salad by cutting up the lettuce and other veggies for the salad.  We put it in a bowl and took it with us as we drove to the park.

"My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married . He lives there and said that he would pick us up from the airport . But , the weather here was cold and there was freezing rain , so our flight was delayed for two hours . It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go . People on the flight were pretty happy to finally leave and a lot of people were having drinks . Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas . The flight itself took a little over four hours due to the fact that we had a non-stop flight . I was glad I paid the extra money for not making any stops . Six hours sitting on an airplane is more than enough for me . The flight was pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was a good thing , especially since my wife hates to fly .

"My wife had a stressful week at work and the weekend had finally come. I knew she needed to relax and feel pampered, so I arranged for us to visit the local sauna.

Even the old Star Wars simulator. That was my favorite game when I was a kid...  Once we're inside the theater, we bought some candies, popcorn, and some drinks.

"Omelettes are one of my favorite breakfast foods, so I grabbed a skillet's from the pantry, place it on the skillet and turned on the heat to medium in order to get ready to cook them. While the skillet was heating up, I cracked two eggs, and the and the contents of the shell into an empty bowl and discarding the white cells. I beat the eggs until the yoke and egg white had combines, then added a few splashes of milk and continued beating. Once I was satisfied with the consistency of the egg of the omelette, then I prepared the contents that will go inside. I already had a bacon that have been cooked previously, so I crushed the bacon with my hands in order to make crumbles. I also grabbed a bag of cheddar cheese from the refrigerator, as well as an onion. I cut a few slivers of onion off, and chop them into fine pieces. Now that I have all of my ingredients prepared, I pour the egg into the preheated skillet and let the egg cover the bottom surface of the skillet. Once I felt the ad was halfway cooked, I use a spatula to lift and flip the egg over to the other side. Immediately after flipping the egg, I placed my crumbled bacon, diced onion, and shredded cheddar cheese on one side of the circular cooking egg. I then use my spatula to close the omelette, flipping the uncovered side of the egg on top of the bacon, cheese and onion that was situated on the other side of the egg.

Then we each got shoes to go bowling in and selected our bowling balls.  We had to try a few balls by picking them up to see how it felt when we held it.  After everyone had their shoes and their balls, we went to our assigned lane.  Once there, we had to set up the computer that keeps track of the scores by putting in our names.  When that was done, my friend Darren went first. He got a strike!  After Darren, Lori, Ann, and Jeff went.  I went last and got a gutter ball.  I got to go again and I knocked over five pins.

"On a bright, sunny Monday morning I put on some light clothes and headed outside to mow my lawn. I opened the garage door, put on my sunglasses, and grabbed a bottle of cold water. I gassed up the lawn mower with my portable gas tank. I pushed the mower into the yard where I normally started to mow. I cranked to mower, and on the third try it started. I pushed the mower back and forth throughout my yard, creating straight and conformed lines. Once I had completely mowed the front of my yard, I turned the mower off and took long drinks of my water.

"On a hot summer day nothing is better then going to a swimming pool.  There is one at the community center by us so we can walk there.  Before we go, we get into our bathing suits and put on our flip flops.  We make sure to pack snacks, and towels and drinks into a bag, and grab a float and a ball to play with.  We walk to the pool, the hot day making us even more excited to going swimming.  Once there, we hurry to find empty lounge chairs to put our towels on and waste no time getting into the pool.  The water feels so cold at first, but its so refreshing.  We swim around and realize we have friends there.  We play a game with the ball for a while before getting out for snacks.  We dry out in the sun while we eat and drink and when we are hot again we get back into the water to swim some more.

One day I was thinking about my grandma who lives in Florida.  I thought it would be nice to write her a letter.  I sat down at the table and took out a pen and paper.  I wrote to her telling her all about the things going on in my life.  I told her about how I went to my friend's birthday party and how I was looking forward to my vacation in August.  I told her how my friends and I planned a trip to Washington D.C. for vacation.  I signed the letter and folded it up.  I carefully placed the letter into the envelope and addressed it to my grandma.  I put a stamp on the letter and I walked down to the post office.  I gave my letter to the postman and he put it in the mail to go out the next day.

"One day I went into my bathroom to take a shower. There was a lot of gunk on the walls and hard water build up around the shower head. I decided it was time to clean the shower before things got worse. I went to my cleaning supply cabinet and took out some cleaning spray, paper towels, and a scrubber.

We had a team battle where all the girls took on the boys at one point my team being the boys were down and we needed a major comeback and eventually what happened was I was able to bring the boys back into the game.

"One evening, I noticed my alarm clock had stopped working, because I had just checked the clock in the living room, and my alarm clock showed a different time. I knew I had to change the batteries. This is important as I need it to wake me up in time for work. I grabbed the clock, turned it upside down and located the slot for the batteries. I lifted the plastic cover and checked what batteries it required: two AA-sized batteries. These are quite common, and I got them from the kitchen drawer.

"One of the buttons came off on my shirt, so I have to sew it back on. Sewing a button can be tricky, since you need a very steady hand. I get some thread and a sewing needle and get to work. I carefully put the button on my shirt, and start sewing. I tie a knot on the end of my thread, and put the needle through the underside of my shirt to where the button is.

"One time in a restaurant I had to send the food back. Let me tell you what happened. Well, it was over one week ago, last Tuesday. I had put on my very best tie that morning before I went to my place of work. Then, I went out for lunch. You see, lunch time is a time of the day when you get to get out of your desk to move around and get to go to places that will serve you food. Well at this place they served me a pumpkin. I said to the waiter, this is not what I had placed my order for. The waiter said that he was sorry and took the pumpkin back. Then he brought out the grilled salmon that I had ordered. I was suspicious of the salmon because what restaurant accidentally serves a pumpkin instead of a grilled salmon.

We sat in our seats and watched the movie. It was a hilarious comedy and it was really funny. After the movie was over we walked out the theater.

"So I stand there on the side of the street, made an eye contact with the cab driver, and raised my hand and waved at him. He gave me a quick flash of his headlights to signal that he saw me, He made his way to the side of the street. So I opened the door and got inside.

"Sometimes I love to watch movies with my husband. When we don't have the kids home to disturb us we like to buy a move on demand right from our own living room.

Taking a trip to celebrate a holiday is a wonderful experience.  I decided to take a trip to New York City this year to celebrate New Years Eve with friends.  My first question was if I should stay in a hotel or with friends.  Due to the cost of hotels I decided that staying with friends was the very best option.  I then decided that to travel to New York City my best choice would be to take the train.  The train trip from Boston to New York City is relatively short and it's very convenient because the train stop is very close to my friends apartment.  My friends and I then decided that we should make dinner reservations for a nice new years dinner in New York.

The train trip from Boston to New York City is relatively short and it's very convenient because the train stop is very close to my friends apartment.  My friends and I then decided that we should make dinner reservations for a nice new years dinner in New York.  I took care of the reservations for dinner and the train and now I am just waiting a couple of months so I can take this really exciting trip.,0ce8e610b0dedae1c383df255d3646b2,How did they decide what to do?,they planned,Maintain their hotel,gpt2,75d407a5c400dff085a44f7d29b15535,Who would be going on the trip?,Narrator and friends.,The narrator,gpt2,55fd32c74f900a76706b7d87e3a8c35e,Why are they going on a trip?,new year celebrations,to celebrate New Years Eve,gpt2,c95ed198142ef4751f46b733faabca31,How did they decide what to do?,they planned,They decided to go to New York City.,gpt2,6467ac908d9fa1d3d57fd95f3f89fb62,Why did they choose to leave in December?,Celebrate New Year's Eve.,Because they had been expecting to see New Years Eve.,gpt2,57a3a030d746feb9877d44adb51d4a3d,How did they decide what to do?,they planned,went to New York City,gpt2,56e014690c8d0d7908abc40ee8080dd3,Who would be going on the trip?,Narrator and friends.,A friend,gpt2,b3f8d3b6f964e80c0aa85f7bfcf2a049,Why did they choose their destination?,To visit friend,they are new to NYC,gpt2,487a876ec0e8233763fd9e139180f6ee,What attractions are they looking forward to?,celebrations,New Years Eve,gpt2,16ac0fe0d4152afc55816f166fa84117,What attractions are they looking forward to?,celebrations,New Year's Eve,gpt2,d83fad90d1f850596b51f18c95f20145
Taking a trip to celebrate a holiday is a wonderful experience.  I decided to take a trip to New York City this year to celebrate New Years Eve with friends.

"Taking my child to bed at night is one of my most special parts of my day every single day. Our bedtime routine is generally the same every day. It begins with a bath. My child loves a bath and will absolutely not go to bed unless he can have his bath. He swims and plays in the bath tub long after he is squeaky clean. Next, he gets into pajamas and brushes his teeth. After that, he comes and holds my hand and tells me he is ready for his books. We both walk hand in hand to my bed, where he sleeps. He picks some books and climbs up into bed. We pull down the covers and both get cozy. I read him two, three or four books until he feels settled and tired enough. Then, I turn out the light and lay next to him as he says his prayers. He then tells me his favorite part of the day. I give him a kiss on the head, I blow a bunch of kisses from the doorway and say ""One Million Kisses in the Room"".

"The fishing day went really well and Allan was looking forward to his dinner of freshly-caught, fried fish.  He had filleted the fish as soon as he returned to the dock and now he rinsed and dried each fillet. He took some saltine crackers and crushed them in a plastic bag, using a rolling pin. He poured the crumbs onto a plate. He put some flour on another plate and added some salt and pepper and mixed them with the flour. Next, Allan cracked two eggs into a bowl and added a couple of spoonfuls of water. With a fork, he quickly stirred the egg and water until they were blended together. Allan put a large frying pan on his stove and turned on the burner. He added oil to about a half an inch. While the oil was heating, he took one fillet in his right hand and set it in the flour mixture and completely covered the fish. He then took the fillet and dipped it in the egg and then set the fish on the cracker crumbs. He turned the fish and pressed on the crumbs until the fillet was coated.

"The grass on our front lawn was beginning to get tall and thick, so before it grew any higher, I thought it would be a good idea to cut it.  I decided to pull out our lawnmower from the shed in our backyard.  There are several kinds of lawnmowers, but the kind of lawnmower we own in gas-powered.  Because our lawnmower had no gas in it, I pulled a gas storage container off of a high shelf in our backyard shed and filled the gas tank.  To start the lawnmower, I pulled the starting cable vigorously a few times.  The lawnmower's motor roared to loud life and I began pushing it through the grass in the yard in a methodical back-and-forth pattern so the grass would be evenly and neatly cut.

"The last time I made an omelette, I was really hungry, but wanted something healthy to eat. It was me and my girlfriend who needed to eat and we both wanted to eat somewhat healthy, while not going out to spend money and get food. As a result, we found eggs in the refrigerator and took out a few for each of us. We then cracked the eggs into a pan, making sure that the outer crust did not end up in the pan.

Many people were waiting outside and I was so thankful that I made a reservation.

"The last time that I made a flight reservation, I planned everything well in advance. I spoke with my dad and sister and my dad told me that in order to not get ripped off, you have to constantly check the prices of airfare and keep checking often. He said that prices tend to be cheaper on certain days of the week and you should clear your search history to avoid the airlines keeping the prices high. I made the reservation after reviewing the prices and received a good deal. This took a lot of work and required me looking around at different airlines for the perfect fight. While this process was somewhat long and difficult, I felt great that I was able to get a good deal and save a lot of money.

"The other day , my best friend and I were riding to his house . When we were almost there , I noticed that the front tire on my bicycle felt rather wobbly and was most likely flat . I was in luck however , as my friend had a bicycle repair kit and some spare tires . Once we arrived at my friend 's house , I asked my friend if he let me borrow his bicycle repair kit . First , I turned the bike over and removed the front tire and tube . Next I filled the tube with air to check where the tube was damaged , and found a small glass shard which had punctured through it . After making ensure the tube was fully deflated , I repaired the puncture in the tube by using glue and applying a patch on top , then slid it back onto the tire using my hands . Next , I placed and pushed the tire back onto the tube . After which , I reconnected the tire onto the bicycle .

So, I signed in and payed for the dress. It said it would arrive at my home in a couple of days.  Next, I needed to find some shoes.  So I searched up ""silver shoes"" and found one that I loved.

"There was a vending machine at my dorm in college. I bought from it often.  One time  stands out more than the others, though.  I have collected exactly $3.15. This was enough for a snickers bar, two bags of Doritos, and a pack of jolly ranchers. This was all in quarters, nickles, and dimes. When I got to the machine, after I bought my food, a woman came up to the machine and tried to buy a Kit-Kat.  I didn't know her well, but the machine failed.  The Kit-Kat was left hanging on the edge, almost off.

They were in the linen closet as they should be. I put the new sheets on the bed and my wife did not like how I put the sheets on and then did it herself. We talked about how old the bed was and talked about buying a new bed. We helped each other put the blankets on the bed. I put the pillows on the bed, but my wife did not like how I arranged them.

"This morning, when I was sharpening a knife, I cut my thumb and needed to put a band aid. First, I went to the medicine cabinet in the bathroom where I keep the first aid kid. I opened up the kit and looked for a band aid that would work for the cut. Some of the band aids were too big, and wouldn't fit on my thumb without hanging over the tip, some were too small and wouldn't cover the cut on my thumb.

"This past month, I ended up coming down with some sort of illness. At first, I wasn't sure what it was, and searching the symptoms online gave me too many results to pinpoint just one illness. To avoid stressing myself further, I decided to visit my doctor. I scheduled an appointment with her over the phone to see her as soon as possible. Thankfully she would be able to see the next day. I went to the clinic the next day and told the receptionist  about my appointment. After a few minutes of waiting, my doctor saw me in her office. After a few different tests, she was finally able to give me a proper diagnosis. She told me that I had come down with bronchitis, and gave me a prescription for some medicine.

"Time to make breakfast! I'll get the coffee started because it will be the perfect temperature by the time all the food is done. I grind the beans and put filtered water into the electric kettle and get it started. I need to put a filter in the Chemex and pour in my ground coffee beans. Meanwhile, I'll gather my ingredients from the fridge. I want eggs, butter, English Muffins, and Canadian bacon. A breakfast sandwich sounds good. I'll get the English muffins toasted in the toaster. My water just finished boiling, so it's time to pour that in the Chemex over the ground beans. I need to get the frying pan and put a little butter in there and turn on the pan. I grab and egg and scramble with a fork. My pan is heating and the butter is melting I put my egg in and swirl it to cover the bottom of the pan. While I wait for my eggs to set up, I'm going to microwave my Canadian bacon. Back to the eggs, they are almost set so I'll fold them into a half circle and flip. Grab my toasted English muffins on a plate. Layer my Canadian bacon and fold my freshly cooked eggs on top. I'll pour myself a cup of coffee and now I can sit down for breakfast.

"Today I had to iron laundry. Ironing is a way to get wrinkle out of clothes. First I set up the ironing board which is a flat surface to put the clothes on while ironing. I put some water into the iron that turns into steam. Steam helps to take wrinkles out of clothes. Once the ironing board is set up I turn on the iron and give it time to heat up, about 2 minutes. Once heated up I put the pants on the ironing board. I start with the top part of the pants first and move or turn the pants after I iron each side. The I iron the leg part of the pants. I line up the leg part of the pants on the ironing board the way I want so that the crease will be the same. Once done I put everything away.

"Today I wanted to read the newspaper, but I do not have a newspaper subscription.  I decided that the best way to get the newspaper would be to go to the library and read it there.  I got dressed, put on my bike helmet, and biked over to the local public library.  There, I went in and asked the library clerk where the daily newspapers were located.  She directed me to the third floor, where all of the periodicals and newspapers were kept.

"Upon deciding that a room in the house needs new wallpaper, the family takes a trip to the hardware store. Wallpaper is selected from the designs available. The wallpaper chosen does not need any extra glue because it is the self-sticking kind and they pick this because it is easier to apply. The family heads home and everyone helps in taking down pictures and posters and any other decorations from the wall.  Dad uses water and a scrub brush to remove the old wallpaper. Everyone helps to clean and dry the walls after the old wallpaper is all gone. When the wall is dry it is time to put the new wallpaper up. The back of the new wallpaper has to be wet, but only a little bit. A small amount of water is applied to the back of the paper and then it is time to carefully place the new wallpaper on the wall.

"Upon deciding that a room in the house needs new wallpaper, the family takes a trip to the hardware store. Wallpaper is selected from the designs available. The wallpaper chosen does not need any extra glue because it is the self-sticking kind and they pick this because it is easier to apply. The family heads home and everyone helps in taking down pictures and posters and any other decorations from the wall.  Dad uses water and a scrub brush to remove the old wallpaper. Everyone helps to clean and dry the walls after the old wallpaper is all gone. When the wall is dry it is time to put the new wallpaper up. The back of the new wallpaper has to be wet, but only a little bit. A small amount of water is applied to the back of the paper and then it is time to carefully place the new wallpaper on the wall. Dad uses a step-ladder to reach the high parts of the wall. Mom and dad use scissors to cut some of the paper to fit around electric outlets and windows.

Washing clothes is a frequent activity that used to be done by hand but now can be done using washing machines and dryers. Some people with lots of children wash clothes everyday. To wash clothes you need to gather all the dirty clothes and use a laundry machine. Some people have laundry machines at home and some people need to go to a wash house to use laundry machines. The wash houses have all different size machines and some take coins and other wash houses take cards. To wash the clothes you have to separate by color so that all the white clothes are together and all the colored clothing is together. Also if you have sheets and towels you want to wash those separately. When you find a machine that is the right size for the clothes you need to wash you add the clothes and then follow the directions to see how much laundry soap you add. Some people use liquid laundry soap and some people use powder laundry soap. You can even do a mixture or combination but make sure to use the right amount. After adding the clothes and the soap you pay for the machine and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the clothes to wash. After the clothes are washed you still need to put them in a dryer unless they are delicate clothes that are not supposed to go into the dryer because they might shrink. You take the clothes and put them in the dryer but make sure not to put anything that might shrink. For the delicate clothes you hang them to dry. After you put all your clothes into the dryers it is time to fold the laundry! This is important so the laundry will be nice and neat and not wrinkled. If you have long pants or nice shirts you can put them on hangers instead of folding.,d8e1c42d625c8b248ed82c18acda768c,Why did they add detergent?,To get the clothes clean,to keep the clothes clean Then they use a machine while washing.,gpt2,621b09367578f07d200eb836cddb8744,Why do they sort the clothes first?,To keep colors from bleeding,For the orderly cleaning,gpt2,53a0279ef70a181624772d78908d4b0f,Why did they add detergent?,To get the clothes clean,to make the clothes cleaner,gpt2,3077e519d80c3e2c564116f8ce7d2e59,How long does the wash cycle last?,30 minutes to an hour,30 minutes,mhpg,faf03340a881e5df9b9bef65e358e6e7,What kind of soap did they use?,Laundry detergent,liquid laundry soap,gpt2,406bbb8a4ea7ca4805430893bfb4b1ff,Why did they add detergent?,To get the clothes clean,To keep the clothes clean,gpt2,ac26a21af3669b9acccb6c32a40adf40,Why did they add stain remover?,To get stains out,they were dirty,gpt2,9ccfdb5b3c53335092ad9e7761de3657,What time did the washer finish?,30 minutes to an hour later,30 min,gpt2,4d0a0af58e5efcecb92e6f0e7b987cb6,Why did they add stain remover?,To get stains out,to put the clothes are washed,mhpg,cbba66a090a8ab7289e96eabf034d576,Who was doing the washing?,Author,The narrator,gpt2,53d7ee768fb4ee6dd6a49e42770887d4

"We normally set a menu on Sunday for each day of the upcoming week to avoid chaos during dinner time. Before I leave for the day in the morning, I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal. At around five-thirty, I begin preparing the meal. One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and seasoned green beans. I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs, ketchup, and a bit of egg to bind it. I also lightly season it for flavor. I push it into the loaf pan, and put it in the oven to cook. I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans. I like to use fresh green beans. They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking them, but they taste so much fresher. I season them with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice.

"We were invited to watch a race for ""track team"", where my daughter was part of it. It was summer, but I was in hurry and  did not realize to bring anything with me. When I reached there, I was already hungry and the people with me too. I usually do not like to get some from outside, but no choice. So I decided to look for vendors or machine. I saw machines, and they were so many. It made me happy. I had $10 with me. The chips were .50 each and cookies were also.50. They had some drinks which was for .50, but big can and bottles.

In order to do this, we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box. We then boiled the water, before putting the pasta in. As we put the pasta in, we stirred it and watched the water boil. After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes, we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat.

"When I got up this morning I was very tired. I decided that I needed something to help wake me up before I started my various activities for the day. I went to the kitchen and took my electric water kettle to the sink and filled it up with enough water to make a couple of large cups of tea. I then put the kettle back down on its base and pressed the start button so it would begin to heat the water up. In the meantime, I found my favorite mug in the cabinet where we keep the mugs. It was in the very front. I like it because it is big and it has cartoon pictures of owls on it that are cute. I took the mug over to the counter where the kettle was a put it down. I then opened up a box of Earl Grey Tea and pulled out a tea bag and placed it in my mug. The kettle then let me know the water was ready by beeping loudly. I poured the water until the mug was about two-thirds full.  I then set a timer for four minutes to give the tea enough time to steep. I like to set a timer because I sometimes forget and end up with cold tea! When the timer went off, I pulled out the teabag with a spoon and placed it in the trashcan. Then I put a packet of sweetener into the tea. I then took the almond milk out of the refrigerator and put enough of the milk into the tea until it turned a lighter color. I put the milk away and got a spoon. I stirred the  tea to make sure it was all mixed well. Then, because I was being impatient, I got two ice cubes and placed them in the mug of tea to cool it off some. I stirred the tea until they melted and then put the spoon in the sink.

"When I got up this morning I was very tired. I decided that I needed something to help wake me up before I started my various activities for the day. I went to the kitchen and took my electric water kettle to the sink and filled it up with enough water to make a couple of large cups of tea. I then put the kettle back down on its base and pressed the start button so it would begin to heat the water up. In the meantime, I found my favorite mug in the cabinet where we keep the mugs. It was in the very front. I like it because it is big and it has cartoon pictures of owls on it that are cute. I took the mug over to the counter where the kettle was a put it down. I then opened up a box of Earl Grey Tea and pulled out a tea bag and placed it in my mug. The kettle then let me know the water was ready by beeping loudly.

"When I last took a young child to bed, I remember it being a difficult experience. I put my little cousin to bed and she is two. This was really tough because she was hyper and did not want to go to sleep. I had to follow a whole structured routine to get her to go to sleep so that she would sleep. This was somewhat difficult, but I first walked upstairs with her and picked out a book, then went to her room and read the book together. When I noticed her start to get tired, I slowly started to stop reading and I left the room. I used the monitor to watch her and noticed that shortly after, she fell asleep.

"When I was a boy scout, we went fishing to a lake.  When we were on the lake (it was frozen), we decided to fish for some fish.  We drilled a hole into the lake and caught a lot.  We wanted to cook them, so we cleaned them out of all the nasty stuff in their body and started a fire.  When the fire was getting calmed down, the hot coals started to steam.  When it started steaming, we got the fish out and put it on a cast iron pan.  We put the pan on the middle of the fire with the lid on it and we waited while the fish cooked.  It smelled really good to us, especially with how hungry that we were.  After it started to smell almost burned, we took the pan off of the fire with hot gloves and ate the fish inside when cooled.",1466e6e85708a9016ebaa404c6ff682f,Where did the fish come from?,they caught it in a lake,Lake lake,gpt2,a712cd6b19ba697ed47f14dbe52fdaad,Who was eating the fish?,The narrator and his boy scout troop,The narrator,gpt2,ef987e896f06e613543c7f2252e45ab6,Who was eating the fish?,The narrator and his boy scout troop,Skittles,gpt2,eb5a7205d3d11ce3ba35e22d9084f76d,Who was waiting to eat the fish?,The scouts.,The narrator and the narrator alone.,gpt2,d7093d347245bbc36f051f7d793d45eb,Who was waiting to eat the fish?,The scouts.,The narrator,gpt2,c55204a0b024196f656c2b330107d226,Who was eating the fish?,The narrator and his boy scout troop,story teller,gpt2,688d8b0301561ed9fb2a447d5357a836,Where did the fish come from?,they caught it in a lake,"Lake, Alaska",gpt2,7c4ab031137481b5c6cf7b1345309a61,Was the fish cooked over a fire?,yes,NO,gpt2,547614bf088feb667975633a332c60a9,Where did the fish come from?,they caught it in a lake,Frozen lake in the mountains.,gpt2,93751ab8d00806e7a141c4cec129b1b5,Who was waiting to eat the fish?,The scouts.,The narrator and the narrator's friends,gpt2,5a2fd90dc81ca916338b5941ce9dbf74

"When I was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday . Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard . I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . It was a small tree so this was not a big hole . I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . The tree grew and became quite large . The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit .",c280075670b19a5d565daa024be47ba4,How much work was required to plant the tree?,a lot of work,$10,gpt2,ce0694054781acd521fb83bdcb48aca7,Where was the tree planted?,In their front yard,On the front yard,gpt2,7e5bb1a05aa3d21e074594a6eef30ecd,Where is the tree located?,In their front yard,In front of the house,gpt2,4b6606a651dba125f661258b23cd6734,Where was the tree planted?,In their front yard,Back yard.,gpt2,6491125ff0f53094a0469f02db4e461c,What tools did they use to plant the tree?,shovel,a bong,gpt2,14eb6d1ed632d4dfd488e6d854706818,How much work was required to plant the tree?,a lot of work,A lot,gpt2,15e4a921f6ee0e47acb87e4bd941d19d,Where was the tree planted?,In their front yard,front yard,gpt2,327308db330e604a1282acd902d7aa50,How much work was required to plant the tree?,a lot of work,a few minutes,mhpg,87f183e78d951abae045526bdd7befb3,What tools did they use to plant the tree?,shovel,a shovel and soil,gpt2,1099484b1fd80a4bd19391f3c1ce8962,Where is the tree located?,In their front yard,The home of 6th grade.,gpt2,28987d2cc4532767917b972b5ee9a9d7
"When I was a teenager, I asked a girl if she would like to go bowling with me at a bowling alley.  She said that she would come and asked me what to bring.  I told her she didn't need to bring anything but herself.  I picked her up the next day and we drove to the bowling alley.  We got out of the car and went into the bowling alley.  We bought a couple of games to play and had to rent shoes so that we wouldn't slip on the slippery floor.  We got a couple of decent weighted balls to throw down the alley.

"When I was hungry last week for a little snack and a soda, I went to the closest vending machine. I felt that it was a little overpriced, but being as though I needed something, I used the vending machine. First, I put money into the snack machine and entered the code for the bag of chips that I wanted. Soon after, the snack came out. Then, I went over to the drink dispenser and got a soda.

"When I was young, my mom had an obsession with painting the walls of our house. As soon as she finished painting one room, she would start on another. We were in this never ending flux of wall colors. Her most ambitious project was painting her bedroom in an unconventional way.

The problem was, her bedroom was huge, so this took months and enlisted the help of me and my siblings.

When I woke up in the morning I noticed that my hair was not looking very clean. It was time to have a shower and wash my hair. I turned on the water in the shower and waited for it to heat up. Then I stepped in and started to wet my hair. When my hair was completely wet I reached for the shampoo bottle and squeezed a small amount into my hand. Then I rubbed this shampoo into every part of my hair. I scrubbed and scrubbed allowing the bubbles to get really big. Then it was time to make my hair really clean. I let the water run all the way over my hair and I kept pushing it through until I could feel that my hair was squeaky clean. I turned the water off. My hair was now clean.

When I woke up in the morning I noticed that my hair was not looking very clean. It was time to have a shower and wash my hair. I turned on the water in the shower and waited for it to heat up. Then I stepped in and started to wet my hair. When my hair was completely wet I reached for the shampoo bottle and squeezed a small amount into my hand. Then I rubbed this shampoo into every part of my hair. I scrubbed and scrubbed allowing the bubbles to get really big. Then it was time to make my hair really clean. I let the water run all the way over my hair and I kept pushing it through until I could feel that my hair was squeaky clean. I turned the water off. My hair was now clean. I found a towel and wrapped it around my head so that my hair could dry. When I had gotten dressed I used the hairdryer to completely dry my hair.

"When it was time to clean the floor, the first thing I needed to do was sweep the debris and garbage. I use the broom to sweep the floor from one end to the next, piling all of the dust, dirt and other debris on the floor into a pile in the center of the room. I used a dustpan to collect all the debris, placing it on the floor and using the broom to sweep all of the brie onto the surface of the dustpan. I empty the contents of the dustpan into the garbage then placed the broom and dust pan into the corner. I then made a bucket of water that had floor cleaning solution diluted into it in order to make sites. I took my mop from the corner of the room where the room was, and placed the head of the mob into the water, soaking the head of the mop. Once the head of the mop was completely submerged underwater, and soaking wet, I removed the mop from the bucket and squeeze out the excess water. I then use the mop to wipe over the entire floor. I ensure that all of the stains and stuck on dirt that was on the floor have been removed with the mop, and that the floor looks spotless including when I finished.

"When my baby was born, I knew I would be learning a lot of new things. She woke up in the middle of the night because she was hungry.

I picked her up one of those Saturdays and took her to the club.  There was a fee we had to pay to dance of about 10 dollars.  After we got in, the music started to get really loud and we got really excited.  We jumped out into the dance floor and started to dance with each other.  We would stomp our feet and clap our hands.  We would twirl around and jump around.  It was a lot of fun for us and we got really thirsty.

"When sending party invitations, I think it is important to first pick an invitation that reflects the theme of the party. For instance, if the theme of the party is a Hawaiian luau, then I would pick an invite with palm trees and tropical flowers. I think it is a wise decision to write out a list of people whom I  want to invite beforehand so that I do not leave anyone out. On the invite, I include information such as when and where the party is. I also include what type of attire people should wear so that people are dressed appropriately for the party. These day, it is much easier to send party invitations through electronic means on the computer such social media or email. It also saves money on stamps, and I do not have to write out the addresses on the envelopes by hand. After sending out the invitations, I sit back and wait for people to r.s.v.p. to tell me whether or not they will be able to attend my party.",8d97452aca01a2ad521e0a100543ec4d,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,So the party would draw attention.,gpt2,25d9f2a18c9bccbd607ab850638433e1,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,they were a Hawaiian luau,gpt2,15172071fbd63f3094def0cab5e6c5c4,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,invite people to a party,backtranslation,a2e2d513cf431f6e9be4554331f1146f,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,It was picked up by the home office,gpt2,3f53e8161b6b504e08416618f1c7a5d5,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,inviting people to join party,backtranslation,3aaa191b21020552fa644804de117c40,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,yes,mhpg,2ec83078e703d128b00793a441eeb9b1,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,to invite guests,gpt2,81b53c4bd683949ee9c03e6382327773,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,To invite friends and family to the party,gpt2,f80b2ba31ab534ec3704f937c889aa0c,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,They were going to a Hawaiian oasis to enjoy Hawaiian food,gpt2,018aa7ff3208cf6d49ac4238a292d362,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,yes,mhpg,87a7ae871e07a0ff2dc64421c6e67d92

"When you work in a restaurant, after the customers have paid the bill and left, you have to clean up the table and prepare it for the next customer.  Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person, but if it was a large family it could be very messy.  All the left over plates, cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed.  The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills, so it is fresh and clean for the next diners.   And if there are placemats they too will need replacing.  My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in, especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use.  Once the new place mats are down, a whole new table setting can be done.  Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table.

"When you work in a restaurant, after the customers have paid the bill and left, you have to clean up the table and prepare it for the next customer.  Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person, but if it was a large family it could be very messy.  All the left over plates, cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed.  The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills, so it is fresh and clean for the next diners.   And if there are placemats they too will need replacing.  My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in, especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use.  Once the new place mats are down, a whole new table setting can be done.  Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table.  It may involve fancy folded napkins, or how the glasses or utensils get lined up. Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates, utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers.

While casually browsing through my friends pictures online I discovered a new revelation . They are called Lush bath bombs and the are colorful scented fizz balls . I quickly ordered a few online from their website and when they came I was overcome with excitement . I brought a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one . I put the Hello Kitty tub stopper in my bath tub and ran my bathwater until the tub was halfway full . Then I dropped the bath bomb in the water and was anointed by the wonderful smell of lavender . The water in the tub fizzled with pretty blue glitter . I got in an soaked for more than an hour and got out feeling like a million bucks .

"Yes going on a train , this is was our ideal weekend activity not too long ago . We purchased tickets to travel from Boston to New York City . As we entered the platform of the train is was pure steel and looked so solidly strong . We walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there . Shortly the train horn blasted making me jump of my seat lol . Anyway we soon started moving and our train ride was underway . The conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets . love scenery so I had the window seat watching everything along the way . First I saw large suburban areas but as we got into Connecticut many farms were being spotted . It was n't very hilly but sure was a country atmosphere . Soon we approached NYC and the train came to slow stop , we had arrived at our destination .

Yesterday I made a flight reservation to fly from Boston to Chicago.  The first step in making a flight reservation is to determine which airline you would like to fly.  I picked American Airlines because I have most of my airline miles with them and I always like to earn more miles.  I accessed the American Airlines website and entered the desired dates of my flight.  The website then provided me a bunch of different flight options for both my departing and returning flights.  I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable and I selected them.  I was then directed to pay for my flight which I did via my American Airlines credit card.  Once my flight was paid for I received an email confirming my transaction and providing me my flight details.

"Yesterday I went bowling with my friends.  They told me that they would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm.  At 2pm I started getting ready.  By 2:30pm I was ready.  I made sure to bring socks with me, since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley.  I grabbed my car keys and got in my car.  I drove to the bowling alley.  I listened to a little bit of music on my way.  Once I got to the bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside.  Once I was inside, I walked over to my friends.  I asked them how many games they wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games.  I walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.  The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50.  I wanted two play two games with my friends so I paid $7.00.  Next, I needed to buy shoes so that I could bowl.  I needed special shoes to go bowling so that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl.  I asked the cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a pair.  Now I needed a bowling ball.  But I didn't want a bowling ball that would be too heavy.  So I chose one that was only five pounds.  All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling.  We all put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game.  I was first.  Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes, and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting.  Then I took my bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back then I let go of the bowl.  The bowling ball flew down the lane.  Out of the ten pins I knocked down six.  Since I didn't knock down all of the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's turn to bowl.  I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.

"Yesterday I went bowling with my friends.  They told me that they would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm.  At 2pm I started getting ready.  By 2:30pm I was ready.  I made sure to bring socks with me, since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley.  I grabbed my car keys and got in my car.  I drove to the bowling alley.  I listened to a little bit of music on my way.  Once I got to the bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside.  Once I was inside, I walked over to my friends.  I asked them how many games they wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games.  I walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.  The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50.  I wanted two play two games with my friends so I paid $7.00.  Next, I needed to buy shoes so that I could bowl.  I needed special shoes to go bowling so that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl.  I asked the cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a pair.  Now I needed a bowling ball.  But I didn't want a bowling ball that would be too heavy.  So I chose one that was only five pounds.  All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling.  We all put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game.  I was first.  Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes, and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting.  Then I took my bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back then I let go of the bowl.  The bowling ball flew down the lane.  Out of the ten pins I knocked down six.  Since I didn't knock down all of the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's turn to bowl.  I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.  Since I knocked down all of the pins I got a spare! By the end of the game I had won the most points out of all of my friends! I won!

"Yesterday I went grocery shopping . I left my house and drove to the store . I parked the car , walked inside and grabbed a shopping cart .

I bought several pounds because my daughter loves fresh strawberries . I finished up in the produce section , buying some things to make a green salad later to go with dinner . I then stopped at the meat section and picked out some nice cuts of steak for dinner . I went into the frozen foods section and found ice cream was also on sale . I bought vanilla and chocolate . I went through the rest of the aisles , consulting my list and picking out what my family needed .

"Yesterday I woke up and decided to wear my favorite cardigan sweater to work.  After taking a shower and eaten breakfast I started getting dressed.

"Yesterday afternoon, my sister and I went to the outdoor neighborhood swimming pool. The pool requires that visitors either live in the neighborhood or be guests of a neighborhood resident in order to enter, and because we met those criteria, we had no problems getting in.

"Yesterday evening, my friend Jasmine called me on my cell phone. We talked about so many things and we were on the phone for about 2 hours. She asked me how life was ever since I moved from Denver to Atlanta. I told her that life had been amazing and the only thing that sucks, is the horrible traffic. Jasmine also mentioned that she will be visiting me next month for a week long vacation. I was so excited to hear that I will have a visitor because sometimes it can get lonely not having family in the same city as you.

"Yesterday evening, my friend Jasmine called me on my cell phone. We talked about so many things and we were on the phone for about 2 hours. She asked me how life was ever since I moved from Denver to Atlanta. I told her that life had been amazing and the only thing that sucks, is the horrible traffic. Jasmine also mentioned that she will be visiting me next month for a week long vacation. I was so excited to hear that I will have a visitor because sometimes it can get lonely not having family in the same city as you.

Yesterday my wife and I wanted to watch a new movie that had just hit the video stands.  I went to the local store which had a Red Box video vending machine outside of it.  I looked over the selections it had till I found the one I wanted.  I put my credit card into the slot for paying and purchased a copy of the movie to watch.

"Yesterday was my daughters birthday and my sister and I threw her a surprise birthday party for her 13th birthday.

To begin this process, I made a to-do list for the day. I wrote the items down in order from highest priority to lowest priority. Then I got to work. I fed the animals (one dog and two cats), took out the garbage, did the dishes, and cleaned the cat's litter box. My next step was to start cooking breakfast. I fried the eggs, cooked the bacon, fried the hash browns, and cooked the toast. After my spouse and I ate, I had a few more dishes to do.

"Yesterday your father and I decided to go play a few rounds of tennis.  Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with two people, sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs.  There is a low net between both people playing the game.  We use tennis rackets and tennis balls to hit the ball back and forth to each other.  Sometimes one person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball so that person scores.  The person with the highest score without any fouls or out of bounds wins the set.  We played for a few hours before both of us became extremely tired, then we came home.

"Yesterday, I went on a date with my husband. We decided to go on a picnic in the park. Before the date, I got out our picnic basket so I could fill it with some good food. In the picnic basket, I put in some leftover cold fried chicken. I also put in a potato salad, some grapes and strawberries. For drinks, I put in some sparkling water. Then I add made sure to include napkins, utensils, and a picnic blanket. The park is close by to our home, so we decided to walk there. It took less than 5 minutes to arrive. When we got there, my husband laid out the picnic blanket on the soft grass. We sat down, and I emptied the basket. We had a good time. We were talking and laughing while eating our food.

"Yesterday, I went on a date with my husband. We decided to go on a picnic in the park. Before the date, I got out our picnic basket so I could fill it with some good food. In the picnic basket, I put in some leftover cold fried chicken. I also put in a potato salad, some grapes and strawberries. For drinks, I put in some sparkling water. Then I add made sure to include napkins, utensils, and a picnic blanket. The park is close by to our home, so we decided to walk there. It took less than 5 minutes to arrive. When we got there, my husband laid out the picnic blanket on the soft grass. We sat down, and I emptied the basket. We had a good time. We were talking and laughing while eating our food. We some birds and gave them some of the breading off the fried chicken. The birds loved it. It was fun, and we really enjoyed each other's company. It was a good break for us from everyday life.

"Yesterday, I went to a doctor appointment. My doctor's name is Dr. Jane who asks her patients to call her by her first name. My appointment was set for two weeks ahead of time for a follow up. I got to the office ten minutes early in case I had to fill out any paperwork. I entered the lobby and approached the front desk. The desk nurse greeted me and had me sign in with my name and doctor I was there to see. She told me I could sit down to wait so I found a chair near the front to sit. I didn't have to wait long and was called to the back by the head nurse. The nurse first took my weight, then my temperature and blood pressure readings. She said everything was fine. Next, she had me follow her to the room where the doctor would see me. Once there she had me sit on the bed and asked me how I was and if I had any symptoms. After taking a blood sample she left the room. I waited for 10 minutes and Dr. Jane came in. After a short discussion, she said the antibiotics had done their job and that my vertigo was all cleared up.
