"2 summers ago, my brother and went on a trip to stay with our aunt and her family for a whole week. We spent the entire week before we left preparing for this trip. The main thing that we needed to worry about was having clothes for the week. Knowing this, we got our suitcases, and made sure to set aside different clothes, including underwear, for just about each day of the next week. Then, we took some extra clothes for swimming just in case we would be doing this while we were over there. After the clothes, we made sure to pack our toiletries, like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, and so on. We packed these in a small bag the day before we left. The last thing to pack was any other items we wanted to take with us. I decided to take a blanket, and my brother decided to take a pillow.

"A few days ago, my son's room was very messy. There were toys all over the floor, so I decided to have him clean it all up.

"A few weeks ago I had to go visit my family in Wisconsin. Since I live in New York, it is quite a long way to drive, so I had to buy a plane ticket. It is much easier to do so today using the Internet, so I went online and searched for flights from New York to Wisconsin. There are so many flights each day, so it was important to pick one at a good date and time without too long of a layover or stop anywhere. I found a flight that was at a good time, and only had a short stop in Chicago each direction, so I booked that ticket. I was able to choose my seat and pay online, I got a confirmation number and was ready to go. I made sure to get to the airport early enough so that I could print my boarding passes, check my luggage, and get through security.

"After I had selected a DVD disk for my collection that contain the movie that I wanted to play, I removed the disc from the container, and flipped it over to the reflective side to see if there were any scratches or fingerprints that would interrupt the movie while it would be playing in the DVD player. I used a cotton ball that had been slightly soaked in rubbing alcohol to clean the reflective surface of the DVD, wiping side to side and up and down instead of in a circular pattern in order to avoid deepening any pre-existing scratches. Once I have removed all of the fingerprints and smudges, I used a dry paper tile to remove the excess alcohol and any strands that may have come off the cotton ball. Now that the DVD is ready to be played, I push the power button on the DVD player. I push the open button to release the cartridge that holds the DVD disc inside of the player. When the cartridge was ejected, I saw that there was a DVD that had already been inside the player, so I removed the DVD from the player, and placed it to the side.

"After a long day, I decided that I wanted to make some tea to sit on. I began by getting a boiling pot out of the pantry, and filling it with water from the sink. I placed the pot with water on the stove, and turned the heat on to high. While I allow the water to heat to boiling on the stove, I removed a teabag from the box, unwrapping it's from the foil and preparing it for use. I then selected my cup that I wish to drink my tea from, and placed the prepared teabag inside of the cup. After about five minutes, the water had begun to boil, so I removed the pots from the stove and poured hot water into my cup. I filled the cup with water, allowing the teabag to be submerged in the hot water, and watched as the teabag turned the water into a brownish color. I placed the pots back on the stove, and turned the heat completely off. I then grabbed my cup with one hand, and the papers them of the teabag and began to dock the teabag in a up and down motion while in the water. This encouraged the water to turn darker as more of the flavor and aroma from the teabag became dissolved into the hot water. After performing the up-and-down motion for about a minute, I placed the cup on the table, allowing the bag to sit in the water a little longer, and allow the water to cool off. After about five minutes, I took the teabag out of the water, and put in a spoonful of sugar to sweeten the tea, then I stirred the tea and sugar so that I may begin to drink the tea.",947436a82f3cde3355673f8ca66a1c20,Did they make it in the kitchen or did they boil water and bring it into another room?,Kitchen,They boiled water and brought it into another room.,gpt2,ad47d54d4f04eed09cda5bd24c1a79a6,Did they put lemon in?,No,the pot,mhpg,320f31f784134211e85a13a227ca8993,How long did they boil the water?,five minutes,About a minute,gpt2,85fe669aa6221b004c67dbb5ae4381c4,Who made the tea?,Person at home.,speakers,gpt2,567b6d618f159f4b7683788f5cc60da2,Did they make it in the kitchen or did they boil water and bring it into another room?,Kitchen,In the kitchen,gpt2,8386da8155bbdcc55fc21ffbe0b4a4d0,Did they make it in the kitchen or did they boil water and bring it into another room?,Kitchen,They boiled water in another room.,gpt2,b0817d143865ebd91fabcf6dc0b483ab,Did they make it in the kitchen or did they boil water and bring it into another room?,Kitchen,yes,mhpg,1142a5a39b06e279bc8be3a9679b79ba,Did they put lemon in?,No,"Yes, they did.",gpt2,aa9016cea507ae3d6ab5487021ffec81,Who made the tea?,Person at home.,The narrator,gpt2,ae27797f8c112f0af9b7e4278e26dd80,Did they put lemon in?,No,Yes,gpt2,f19f8e0ab4f1bd9e4a11163288e19f59

"After dinner and bath it was time for bedtime. I made sure my kids brushed their teeth and got into their pajamas. After I tucked them snugly into their beds I sat at the edge and picked out their favorite book so we could read a few pages together. We always pass the book back and forth so we all read together. I make sure to help them if they have trouble with the words, so that we can all learn from our mistakes. We usually read a chapter in our bedtime book, but then it is time to close their eyes and drift off to sleep. I make  sure to kiss their heads before I cut off the light and pull the covers up so they stay warm.

After taking a two week trip to Europe I arrived home with lots of laundry.  I decided that I should start washing my clothes the night I arrived home.  I did three loads of laundry but I was so tired that I tossed all of the clothes onto the couch without folding them.  I woke the next morning feeling a bit refreshed and decided that is was time to tackle the pile of clothing on the couch.  First I separated the clothes into heaps based on clothing type and then I began folding all of the items.  I used to work in a clothing store so I began folding my clothes very precisely.  I folded everything neatly and made piles based on how the clothes would be stores in my closet.  Once all of the clothes were folded I returned them all to their proper places in my closet and I was ready to start my day.,c45db962b8173a09767cb414b8211bab,When did they start folding clothes?,The next morning,At night,gpt2,1f252b78a64d1384b5507e03ee132d28,Where did they put everything when they finished?,Where they belonged.,in their closet,gpt2,24565c81085845cbd6440496ccf9d82b,How many clothes did they fold in total?,Three loads worth,3 so far,gpt2,32d9ceba332c59221e567ddf2a1c3ece,When did they start folding clothes?,The next morning,After they finished washing them,gpt2,deacf4f068176114b3c1043e915ae4d7,Where did they put everything when they finished?,Where they belonged.,They put everything in their closet.,gpt2,e2f6c5fcd16307927d83d66f479f0251,How many clothes did they fold in total?,Three loads worth,Three,gpt2,d1ef7589d8303ccb6e0a825972fdc2c6,How many clothes did they fold in total?,Three loads worth,2 clothes,gpt2,34c6951e74a51908303bbc42b3e0a9b5,Were they folding clothes for themselves or someone else?,Themselves,yes,mhpg,1569874fbde68c9c370103cee87d7a92,Where did they put everything when they finished?,Where they belonged.,They put clothes in their clothesheets.,gpt2,86b37fffc01773195321fad7837c295d,Were they folding clothes for themselves or someone else?,Themselves,owned them,gpt2,c3a102111b4ea95cdaf79294f626cc7c

"As I was preparing breakfast , I noticed that I was out of a lot of things that are staples in the preparation of most other dishes . Bread , milk , and things of that nature . So after I was done with breakfast , I sat down to prepare a grocery shopping list . I thought of all the things off the top of my head that I would need , and then I perused through my cupboards and refrigerator to fill in the blanks .

"Baking a Birthday Cake For an Awesome Nephew It was the day before my nephew 's third birthday . I wanted to bake him a very special birthday cake . He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . I poured yellow cake batter in the medium-sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' I topped off the cake with a number 3 candle .

"During the summers off I like to go to the beach on my days off.  I will start early in the morning and pack the car with a cooler with drinks and sandwiches, chairs, towels and an umbrella.  I'll drive to the beach and park as close as I can.  Gathering everything up I'll carry it across the sand till I find a nice spot down by the water.  Then ill set up my chair and umbrella, making sure to drive it deep into the sand so it doesn't blow away.  I'll make sure to put on sunscreen before I settle in my chair to sunbath for a while.  And when I am sweating and hot I'll run into the water and swim around to cool off.  While I dry off I'll have a sandwich and something to drink.

Alex played with his bath toys, and splashed around in the bubbles. He then got dried off and put on his pajamas. Last night he wore his favorite pajamas with Lightning McQueen from the movie ""Cars"". We went into the bathroom and brushed our teeth, Alex used his green Crayola crayon toothbrush, and got his teeth nice and clean. We then read a bedtime story, last night was Goodnight Fish, which was a book he got when he and his grandparents went to visit the aquarium. After that, he got tucked into his crib, with his favorite blanket, and his favorite stuffed animals: a lamb and a penguin. We sang ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"", and turned off the lights.

"First I go to the store and buy bread.  For the freshest bread, I get a whole loaf and bring it home to slice it there.  I use a bread knife which makes cutting it easier, and cut off just what I need for the toast, leaving the rest whole.  I wrap and store the remaining loaf for next time.  Then I get the toaster out of the cabinet and place it on the counter, then plug it in. I choose the darkness of the bread - not too dark, somewhere in the middle for flavor and safety - then indicate the slice thickness using the knob on the toaster. I place the first two slices of bread in the slots and press down on the big button, which causes the bread to drop in and the toaster to get very hot.

Luckily, we still have some napkins left over from the birthday party last week, so we will use those. It doesn't matter that they say ""Happy Birthday."" We put a folded napkin to the left side of each plate. On top of each napkin we put a fork. Except for Tom, he gets a small fork. On the right side of the plate we put a knife and spoon.

"For dinner tonight I decided to cook pasta. I entered my kitchen and grabbed a pot from under the stove. I filled the pot to the brim with water and placed the pot on the stove.

I had various choices such as spaghetti, penne, angel hair and elbow macaroni. I decided on penne. Approximately twenty minutes after I placed the water to boil on the stove the water was at a rolling boil which is perfect for cooking pasta. I turned the heat down on the stove to medium. I grabbed an empty bowl from my cupboard and filled it with penne pasta so I had one serving. I dumped the bowl of pasta in the water. After doing this I added a pinch of salt because it gives the pasta flavor. I took a wooden spoon and stirred the pasta occasionally. After about fifteen minutes I took my wooden spoon and tried the texture of the pasta to ensure it was filly cooked and tender. It was so I grabbed a strainer under my cupboard and placed it in the sink. I took the pasta off the stove and dumped it into the strainer.

"For my anniversary with my husband, I decided to cook him a very fancy and nice breakfast. One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice.

"For my anniversary with my husband, I decided to cook him a very fancy and nice breakfast. One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice. I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this! I went to my local farmer's market and got the biggest, juiciest oranges I could find. I got about ten oranges because I wasn't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband. I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink. It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use! I was excited to try it. I sliced all of my oranges in half and plugged the juicer in. I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice.

"Going to the dentist was hard for Mike. He was a little bit afraid of going, but his mom always went with him.  When he got to the dentist office, they were all nice to him.  He had to go sit in a dentist chair, and lean back for the lady to check his teeth.  Then she started to clean his teeth with a little machine and a little stick.  The machine made a whirring sound , but it was just water in it, and it washed his mouth out when she finished.  She then rubbed his teeth with a buffer, that made his teeth shine.  It tasted like bubble gum. He liked that part.  Then the dentist came in and examined his mouth, to make sure the lady cleaned them well. He was also checking for cavities.  Mike had no cavities that day, and the dentist was happy with Mike's clean mouth.

I am more of a cook rather than a baker of pastries and sweets . But with the internet and YouTube anything can be found . I searched YouTube to find a good simple but interesting set of instructions . I decided on a chocolate cake as I am weak when it comes to resisting chocolate . I gathered all of the ingredients and placed them on the counter along with measuring cups and spoons . I could not believe how much sugar goes into the baking of a cake but that 's why it 's not a health food . All the ingredients went into a bowl for me to mix with a 1980 's hand held electric mixer . While the over was preheating I scooped a the mixture into a well greased baking pan . Naturally my finger stole a taste of the raw cake . After placing the bowl in the oven and and waiting the proper time I removed the cake and frosted it after it cooled down .

"I am really thirsty and hungry so I need to buy something from the vending machine while shopping. I needed to find a vending machine that both sold soft drinks and food. I found 2 machines side by side that one sold drinks and the other sold food. I looked at the food selections and they had mostly chips and candy. I decided on buying chips. I decided on sour cream and onion chips. They cost $1.00 so I looked in my wallet to make sure I had enough money to buy it. I found 4 quarters and put them in. I pressed the number for the sour cream and onion chips and thankfully they came right out. I then moved on to the drink machine. I really wanted a Dr. Pepper. Thankfully this machine had it.

As we both get in the car, we put on our seatbelts. Check. Now he instructs me to put the key in the ignition and give it a gentle turn forward toward the front of the car. I hear the engine crank and can feel it hum. He tells me to grab the crankshaft and put it into the ""D"" position. I feel the car surge forward and immediately hit the brake pedal on the left and car stops. He tells me it's fine and to give it a little gas.

"I asked someone at Home Depot about this since I've never done it before. They were very helpful. They told me how to figure out how much wallpaper I would need. I had to get a tape measure and measure all four walls. I had to measure how high they were and how wide they were. Then there was this formula where you multiplied the height times the width, divided that by 144 . . . and that's as far as I got. Wallpaper isn't that expensive and I didn't mind having some left over.  So, I just made a guess when I picked out my wallpaper. I can always get more if I need it. I finally got everything out of my bedroom. Other than my bed, the room was totally empty. Then I made a table out of two saw-horses and a board. I opened the package and unrolled a sheet of wallpaper on the table.

I decided to make dinner for my family this Friday night. I had a few ingredients for making spaghetti but I still needed spaghetti sauce and bread rolls. I already had the noodles at my house. I drove my car to my nearest supermarket. I grabbed a shopping cart and entered the store. I strolled the aisles until I found the Italian food isle. I looked around for my favorite spaghetti sauce and found it. i put it into my shopping cart and proceeded to go to the bakery section. I ordered some freshly baked Italian bread rolls. I put all the items into my shopping cart and started making my way towards the cashier check out. I placed my items on the cashier desk and paid for my items. After paying I went back to my car in the parking lot and placed the items inside my car. I drove home and started boiling the pasta and heating up the spaghetti sauce.

"I don't normally receive phone calls on my house phone, I only have one because it came with my home internet package. Today, the phone rang. I didn't hear it at first as I was doing dishes, because I keep the cordless phone in my bedroom on my nightstand. I finally heard it after the third or fourth ring I'd say, and ran into my room to answer it. I wasn't surprised to hear the voice on the other end was a female telemarketer.

"I drove the the bowling alley closest to my house. I walked in the door and went to the counter. I told the cashier how many games I would like to play. He asked if I would like to rent bowling shoes. I said yes. The cashier asked my shoe size and I told him I wore a size 9. The cashier went to the back and got the right size shoes. The cashier told me my total and I paid the bill. After I paid, the cashier told me what lane I would be using.  I then went and picked out a bowling ball. I picked a hot pink bowling ball. I then went to the lane that was assigned to me. I put in my name on the computer and began my game. I played 4 games. I then started to get hungry so I went to the snack stand and ordered nachos. After I ate my nachos, I played two more games. I then returned my bowling ball to the proper place, and returned my shoes to the cashier.  The cashier told me to have a nice day and to return soon.

"I felt very hungry so I looked in my fridge for something to eat. A hot dog package caught my eye. It looked tasty to eat and thought it could curb my hunger.  I took out the package and read the instructions for cooking. There are a few different ways to cook hot dogs, microwave, boiling on the barbeque or grill. I decided since I was so hungry already and did not want to wait long I would use the microwave method. I opened up the package and took out a hot dog. Placing it on a paper towel I set the cook time for 20 seconds. It was ready then but very hot. I took out a bun and then spread some mustard, relish and ketchup on it as well.

"I found a beautiful little tree at the local nursery and brought it home to plant in my garden . I had already picked the spot it was to go , a place in the middle of my yard where it could get full sun . After gathering the shovel and watering hose , and putting on my gardening gloves , I set to work on digging the hole . I had to make sure the hole was deep enough to fit its roots comfortably . I dampened the soil in the hole with a little water . Once the hole was ready , I laid the tree on its side and gently removed the pot from it . I placed the sapling into the hole and looked to see that the base of its trunk would be level with the ground , then began scraping the soil back into the hole , over the roots . I tamped the soil down , so as to prevent any air pockets , and watered it once more .

I looked through all of the movies and I finally picked a movie that I liked and went over to the DVD player.  I turned the player on and I also turned the TV on.  I took the movie disc out of the case and placed it into the player.  Then I pushed the movie in.  The menu came up on the TV screen.  I picked to play the full movie, and I started to watch the movie.

I had a pile of clothes that needed to be washed. First I separated the white clothes from the colored clothes. I washed the white clothes first. I put the clothes into the washing machine. I then put laundry soap in. I also put about a cup of bleach in. Bleach helps make the white clothes stay white. I turned on the washing machine by setting the dial to the the amount of time to wash the clothes. I also set a knob for how full the washer was. I also set the temperature of the water. After the clothes were done washing I put them into the dryer. I set the dryer for 30 minutes because I think that is how long it will take to try them. I did everything above for the colored clothes except put in bleach. I only washed 2 loads of clothes.,9999bb20bedd426ae92dc878ed1bb007,Did they use bleach?,"Yes, they did/",Yes,gpt2,0a957dcc936168ea96dad5f73577f419,Did they use bleach?,"Yes, they did/",No,gpt2,e4998f7b356fa2f9719c0eb706475425,How did they wash the clothes?,with a washing machine,by setting the dial To the volume of the water.,gpt2,d61fbd748dd1ce5f4d007abcbbf8fce0,How did they wash the clothes?,with a washing machine,They used their hands,gpt2,39fcc62e6bed9148557f01b7922823c7,How did they wash the clothes?,with a washing machine,Put them in the washing machine.

I called the receptionist at the office to make an appointment.  She asked me what my problems were and booked me down for the next week.   I came in early for my appointment.

"I had been on a trip to Boston, and it was time for my flight home.  I arrived at the airport ninety minutes before my flight was scheduled to leave to insure I had sufficient time to check in, pass through security and make it to the flight gate.  I had confirmed my reservation ahead of time and printed out a boarding pass which I took with me to the airport.  When I arrived I had luggage to check.  Since I arrived in with enough time I checked my bags at the check in counter.  There was a much shorter line for people who already had their boarding pass.  They gave me receipts which I would need to claim my luggage at my destination.  I put the receipts in my wallet so I would not loose them.  Next there was a line for the security screening.  I patiently waited in the line with the other passengers.  It took 30 minutes to get through the line.  At the screening check point they verified I was not carrying any dangerous items.

"I had been putting of visiting a doctor because my regular primary care provider was nearly a mile away, and I owed the money that I simply did not have. I decide to visit an office that was much closer. I was so glad I did because they had sliding scale fee that drastically reduced the cost of doctor visits and specialists that I desperately needed to see. I filled out all the necessary paperwork and had a visit scheduled. The date came and I went to see my new primary care provider. I had anxiety as I always do when seeing a medical professional. She ended up being incredibly kind and understanding and she gave me a referral to see a chiropractor. I was so happy that I was finally going to be able to see someone to help with my back pain.

"I had holidays in the last week. It was a long weekend and I planned to watch some movie. My father gave an idea to gather my friends and watch some good movie and he promised to help in playing the movie. I invited some of my interested friends to watch the movie. We discussed and decided to watch the animation movie 'Up'. I went to the shop along with my father to buy the DVD for the movie 'Up'. My father taught me to connect the DVD player to our television. Once the player is connected, I had to insert the disc in the player through the proper hole. Once the disc is placed, I had to switch on the play button to get the movie played. After the movie is finished we have to push the stop button and get the disc out of the player. I learned everything well from my father and played the movie once our friends gathered. We all enjoyed the movie well.",c2a43eca32f91edd50fb67e90c319ab8,Who selected the movie?,They did,They chose their narrator,gpt2,56c1bf4b6e61df1631416d55f4a2bb8c,Who played the movie?,The narrator,Storyteller,gpt2,4eb53d78c849d1279f8d2131127dbd5b,Did they like the movie?,Yes,"yes , they all the friends well",mhpg,355dc411d18389c92f1cdd40ed41cbeb,Who played the movie?,The narrator,Friends,gpt2,530eb7e9e2371afdff60b0469951e544,Who selected the movie?,They did,narrator and friends,gpt2,4332fbda80aae11f8a49f8ce528436de,Did they like the movie?,Yes,Yes they did.,gpt2,0a514ef19e12473ff5e025545a793257,Who played the movie?,The narrator,The narrator and friends.,gpt2,cb37fd2973c99609989d8a703fc88ffe,Who selected the movie?,They did,The narrator,gpt2,10f9c1e2ada080311f2caa97f6c22926,How good was the movie?,very good movie,Very good,gpt2,de7ec9130094fb4a7578d553f96ef83a,How good was the movie?,very good movie,So good,gpt2,4e32a779888464131e340ae3b70effdf
"I had just moved into a new home.  The house had been empty for quite a few years.  As a result, there was a lot of remodeling to do.  One of the first things I decided to do was paint the living room walls.  The walls were currently painted an ugly yellow and the paint was peeling.

I have never had to ride a public bus until 4 years ago when I had no other transportation and was forced to take a public bus anywhere I needed to go . The first thing I had to do was find a bus schedule and learn how to read the time and places to catch the bus and how to make any needed transfers . This was a little hard to do but once I figured it out it was OK as long as I always kept a schedule with me . I mostly took the bus to work and I only had to worry about catching one bus on the street I lived on and I did not have to sorry about any transfers . The bus ride cost me $ 1.25 and transfers where an additional 50 cents . Many people rode the bus and I meet several nice people on the bus . The bus drivers were always nice and I became friends with several of them . The bus only came once an hour and I had to make sure I did not miss it if I was going to work because then I would be late for work . The bus always made a stop at the main depot in order to pick up more people . There was usually about a 20 minute wait so the driver could have break in the late afternoon . I did not like having to take the bus but it served my purpose for a while and I was thankful to have the bus available .,15dafd99784424a4d0df30171fde63de,Who drove the bus?,The bus drivers,The narrator and her friends,gpt2,b6d75769c0abbcded0efc946431d5c7e,How much did they pay for the bus ride?,$1.25 + $0.50 per transfer,yes,mhpg,c8d7510643ec2f276182b12ccf1a3d4f,When did the bus come,Every hour it came by the same bus stop,back after it was over and the story told to newsman,gpt2,d88901b4fd947db475da6410d7321b7b,Was the bus driver friendly?,Yes,No.,gpt2,a860c6344c7584fcc8470e09737cd625,How much did they pay for the bus ride?,$1.25 + $0.50 per transfer,free,gpt2,b74381cf7403632f6a6d4402a8a084c9,Were they meeting other people?,Yes,"Yes, they always had to catch buses",gpt2,50121e8c220440e23ff93c1cb5fb9059,When did the bus come,Every hour it came by the same bus stop,back 4 years ago,gpt2,f91135f240f0180901848dc1446a00cd,Who drove the bus?,The bus drivers,The author,gpt2,ed0ffa8d7a17fb03c198285c024c6244,When did the bus come,Every hour it came by the same bus stop,to town/town,gpt2,879ff7741b3298f882413db82e3a8fe9,How much did they pay for the bus ride?,$1.25 + $0.50 per transfer,$ 1.25,gpt2,cd9f968aa304af1e59e1059e58399b1e
"I have relatives that live very far away from where I do, and unfortunately they don't have access to the same technologies as me, so I can't communicate with them over the Internet. For some time, we've had to do it the old-fashioned way - by writing letters to each other. After enough time would pass since one of them would send me or my family a letter, I would begin to work on one. I would write for a few minutes, usually talking about things that my family recently did, and asking them how they've been doing. If possible, I would even attach pictures to the letter, so they could see what we've been up to. I would then close up the letter in an envelope, stamp it, and write on their address. The next morning, I'd drop it in my mailbox for the postman to pick it up and take it to the post office.

I just bought a new house so I need to decorate it with art. I have lots of paintings but I just bought a new one that I know will great above the fireplace.  I have a ladder that is just the right height so I climb it with my measuring tape in hand. I measure to the center of the wall and mark the spot with a pencil. Then I get my girlfriends screw gun and put a screw in the wall. Now it's time to get the painting and hang it on the screw. I take a step back and see if I like it. It's also important to see if my girlfriend likes it. When she gets home from work we both stare at the painting and make sure it's even on the wall and that we like where it is placed. We are both satisfied with the painting.,dc8d45a1d7a593958a6db31714ed591e,Why should they measure the painting before they hang it?,To make sure it fits,the girlfriend bought the painting,mhpg,0489f1d05962c2083866902fabaaaee1,Who helped them put up the painting?,Nobody,Nobody helped,gpt2,2884f63b956bd9346e9cbbfa947e77f7,How long did it take to hang it?,A few minutes,not long,gpt2,cabe037e374f88c4a0dbc2e41dc29747,Why should they measure the painting before they hang it?,To make sure it fits,To make sure it's on the wall,gpt2,255f7d3b97e9cf13e5ba13d6b2bde4f5,Why should they measure the painting before they hang it?,To make sure it fits,Because it is too small,gpt2,85053ed559f62672801db1a1824a7fcb,Why should they measure the painting before they hang it?,To make sure it fits,it's new So as they work they will learn how to measure.,gpt2,c114386cc596d5e2a0a2cf7d32750f65,Who helped them put up the painting?,Nobody,Noone,gpt2,fd7f240501ca99337b87dd9c264e7942,How long did it take to hang it?,A few minutes,A couple minutes,gpt2,9a1b21382786ac654dc38957a42f16d1,How long did it take to hang it?,A few minutes,A few seconds.,gpt2,540dbce939f5d6c1d2e8be140e177a19,Who helped them put up the painting?,Nobody,narrator,gpt2,a0f441fbc17d177076f5965867c91c49

I like to cook a lot but I am not a very good baker . So I never bake cakes from scratch . However I do like cake a lot so I do bake them . I use box mixes . They are easy to use and make a very nice cake . it really does n't take much time . All you need to do is get one bowl . Add the cake mix from the box . Either 2 or 3 eggs added to the bowl . Then a half cup of oil and finally about a cup of water . Then you need to get your mixer and put it on medium and mix it all up for 2 to 3 minutes . Then put it into a non stick cake pan and bake for about 30 minutes . So all together about 10 minutes preparation and 30 minutes baking you can have a good tasting cake in 40 minutes . . I do n't really like frosting so as soon as it cools I cut myself a slice .,733e6a314de9eb3d618f23ae849d92bb,Will the baker use icing?,no,"Yes, they use a cake mix",gpt2,456069292a51845919b59a6f6414977a,Will the baker use icing?,no,Yes he will,gpt2,b9d3f22fb1f7e230842caab0db651c71,When will the cake be eaten?,right away,straight away,backtranslation,40a97566bf9ed359ac55ec0b19e40240,When will the cake be eaten?,right away,Before it cools,gpt2,3d3de57e0cc125a691c5c207cb6fd688,Will the baker use icing?,no,Yes,gpt2,cb9f3ee703992269e9d6e35ca1f3bb19,When will the cake be eaten?,right away,soon in 40 minutes,mhpg,35a23620a7dd7a2ee0bc64536f1a739c,Will the baker use icing?,no,not,backtranslation,c8354db80be415bfd644004133c3d91f,Will the baker use icing?,no,it was not,mhpg,f910b770dd3b04e7444170e01299db5e,When will the cake be eaten?,right away,30 minutes,gpt2,dcd38af8bbff9604bbd3b091e5de330a,When will the cake be eaten?,right away,By mistake,gpt2,f0fa1e3ef435e7a06da43e29f719ea58

"I look out my window at my front yard and notice that my lawn is growing a little too tall. I think it is time to mow it. I check the sky for rainy clouds to make sure it will not rain soon, and also check the Internet for any rain later today. It will not rain today, so it is safe to mow the lawn on my lawnmower. My lawnmower has a motor and a seat for me to ride in, so it is much easier to use. I go into my garage to make sure my lawnmower has enough gas to work. The lawnmower has plenty of gas and is in good shape, so I turn the key and start its engine. The lawnmower doesn't cut the grass unless you pull the lever that controls the blade, so I pull that lever and start to drive the lawnmower over the grass. I make sure the grass is being cut after I drive over it, and carefully steer the lawnmower over all the tall grass in my yard until the grass is cut.",f9b0e8eda9944a3edbeac2db22ab95f5,Where did they find the mower?,In the garage.,came all the way to their house,gpt2,1eca0f18ce4a3afd83e8dd19a56b4608,Where did they put the mower after it was finished?,Back in the garage.,In their garage.,gpt2,e273158bce14ca3ff84214fb0ac0bc8b,Where did they put the mower after it was finished?,Back in the garage.,In a garage.,gpt2,feacb30f18b680da6968541c8d81e98b,Where did they find the mower?,In the garage.,in the front yard,mhpg,de64daf54faee10a44ddbecb97c62551,Where did they put the mower after it was finished?,Back in the garage.,back to the garages .,backtranslation,7c7bc454238e53ce2a924a9cc0e97c49,Where did they put the mower after it was finished?,Back in the garage.,garage,gpt2,799f8c2ea6b4401a0e2f123374bf0d98,Where did they put the mower after it was finished?,Back in the garage.,in the front grass,mhpg,24b3b687a937c246d3ea083c54919d17,Where did they find the mower?,In the garage.,in the garmoo .,backtranslation,77af0d2359e98af1062deb8b5c1d365c,Where did they find the mower?,In the garage.,A garage.,gpt2,bbb2d577dff242678c461a61c26ae917,Where did they find the mower?,In the garage.,In their garage.,gpt2,10abeec17ff4c35576b129c00aebc1f9
"I looked at my sink which contained a ton of dirty dishes that needed to be washed and put away. I removed the dirty dishes from the sink and plugged the drain. I turned the faucet on and let the sink fill with water as I poured in a decent amount of dish soap. The bubbles from the soap rose up to the edge of the sink. Once the sink was full, I turned the water off and placed the dishes into the water. I grabbed a wash cloth and put it into the water to get it wet. I repeatedly scrubbed each dish and rinsed them off in a stream of cool water. Then I placed them on a drying mat I had placed next to the sink.

"I love cherries . I thought it would nice if I had a cherry tree in my backyard . There was plenty of room in my yard for a large tree , so I decided to plant one . I drove my pickup truck to a nursery near where I live . They had many different types of trees there , all growing in large pots . The trees were very skinny , but I knew once they were out of the pots and planted in the ground , they would grow into large trees . I found some cherry trees and saw how much they would cost . I asked a man who worked at the nursery if he would put the tree in my pickup after I paid for it . I went to the cashier and paid for the tree and the man loaded it into my truck . When I got home , I got a shovel and dug a huge hole where I wanted the tree to grow . I made sure all the big rocks and roots from other trees were not left in the hole . I added some manure so the roots would get all the extra nutrients a growing tree would need . In the middle of the hole I made the soil higher in the shape of an upside down cone . I took the tree out of my truck and removed it from the pot . I stood the tree up in the middle of the hole , with the tree on the top of the cone and the roots spread out around it . This would make sure the tree would not be standing in water and the roots could drink the water easily . I replaced the dirt , making sure the tree was even with the ground around the hole .

I even tried to find some near me so that they would be shipped to me quick. The quickest way to get them and not have to pay too much money would cause them to get to me in four days. So I decided to order and wait. On Monday morning there was a package by my front door. I opened it. It was the vitamins. It took less than 24 hours for them to get to me. I was happy the vitamins were here. I tried to figure out how they go to me so quick. Then I figured out that they came from an Amazon facility near me. I might order from Amazon again since they got here quick.,befe0ac3f1e061532b080dc0668f2993,did they use any coupons?,no,No they bought for it in store,gpt2,754440421000dc3c237f12aaccd131eb,did they use any coupons?,no,No they did not.,gpt2,e5a003e9cca6da43274273a31acc3641,Where is the order shipping from?,by their house,Theubrid.com,gpt2,b32802b987bfd0f465e57d57b2f0fd0f,Where is the order shipping from?,by their house,amazon facility,mhpg,71a6f795d80474dadaf45be7537827a8,Where is the order shipping from?,by their house,To go to the store.,gpt2,9d7b823427c037327f9b1527f82809e7,Why didn't they go to a store?,online shopping is easier,They were not going online.,gpt2,bc28bb6e31f4800eec1a947dae25aed8,what website was used?,Amazon.com,VITUTES.com.,gpt2,bdec8ec6889795929ff86942ff8355af,Why didn't they go to a store?,online shopping is easier,no one wanted to buy,gpt2,cd65de9dddf0ab4518470ab60a474431,What website did they shop on?,Amazon.com,Online store,gpt2,e0fe7d84a3438a8779db546f7f4fe0be,Where is the order shipping from?,by their house,Amazon,gpt2,2845d940a46cdcf4893f74a2ca561c47
I love to drive. About 6 months ago I drove to a town about 100 miles away. The day before I made sure I had a full tank of gas and that the car was clean inside and out for the trip. I left on my trip in the morning. I was glad the car was clean and full of gas so I would not have to do all that stuff right before going on the trip. It was a Saturday morning and not too much traffic. I live in a city. It took about 45 minutes to get out of town. I like driving safely and giving plenty of room ahead of me and the vehicle in front of me. You never know when someone will do something stupid and I will have to swerve out of the way. On my trip everyone drove safely and I did not have to swerve out of the way.,7b62276162fa57935d926922c2afc05b,How many people were in the car?,One.,1,gpt2,c1a177d3be234e3f04c6c2685417e584,How many people were in the car?,One.,Two.,gpt2,56e2ef878eae83e9ee4875a5ae326412,Where did they drive to?,A town 100 miles away.,The town.,gpt2,29787b8d2cc256c86de7a7dc7605dfba,Why were they driving?,they went out of town,they left the city,backtranslation,b612bdceacdf2e70c9bcbf49301c57cc,How many people were in the car?,One.,a few,gpt2,913d2e77396a5c80c147ca1df3527317,Why were they driving?,they went out of town,they were going to go eat,gpt2,aba66414e89dcde89aca197823461e5a,Where did they drive to?,A town 100 miles away.,city 100 miles from the coast .,backtranslation,7bf41974fb6efbbf92d45d6cb7595c83,How many people were in the car?,One.,no .,backtranslation,ed470cc43cd1951e213db12539a42642,Why were they driving?,they went out of town,Clean and full of gas.,gpt2,c08553d8b5cf1a22803d6ef81bc5e1d7,Why were they driving?,they went out of town,It was a Saturday morning.,gpt2,ad577811d34836600b0fc53f4a31eeba
I love to make hot chocolate in the wintertime. Today it snowed so I decided to make myself a mug of hot cocoa. Some people just put a mug of water in the microwave and then add Swiss Miss. Not me. I use milk in mine. First I put the milk in a sauce pan. Then I put it on the burner on medium high heat. While the milk is heating up I get mix cocoa and sugar together. I have to be careful while boiling milk because once I did it for too long. Then a skin formed on top and it was gross.

I needed to put wall paper on the walls of my room. The room was in dire need of new wall paper. The old wall paper was looking bad. I asked my friend Ryan to help me put new wall paper up. He was a painter and regularly did this kind of work. I first removed the old wall paper from the walls with Ryan. We then got the new wall paper and applied it to the walls. It required us to brush down the paper so it would stick. We checked to make sure everything was even. I did not want uneven wall paper. After we applied the first sheet we started applying the other ones. We checked to make sure the sheets were even as we went. Finally after applying the new sheets we cut the excess paper away. I wanted my room to look tidy and fresh. Overall it was fun putting up new wall paper with my friend.,43003eb4461da4c365629f623c880d7a,How did they get the room ready to be papered?,They took the old paper off,they painted it,gpt2,6152bbeb8d3ec50e8cbd1892335164ce,How did they get the room ready to be papered?,They took the old paper off,They drove,gpt2,bdce80426aae6a621f23293ce6c71c15,Why did they decide to paper the room?,the old stuff looked bad,needs new wall paper,gpt2,4d6570c3e6eb966b27e56d611994d129,Why did they paper the room?,The old wallpaper looked bad,wallpaper damaged,gpt2,58f0598458b06398bf6e13bdb39d47f7,Why did they decide to paper the room?,the old stuff looked bad,to new the room,mhpg,3dcff2101de7301a1abfbb77c5b8a38f,Who papered the room?,Two friends,The author,gpt2,bb39f56fad252b907fd2f963e0749982,Why did they paper the room?,The old wallpaper looked bad,it was the room was dire,mhpg,bc4290b8f65e38aba186e7ddd57b37bf,How did they get the room ready to be papered?,They took the old paper off,yes,mhpg,7116a01e51738d59414b947dae6e360f,Who papered the room?,Two friends,the speaker,gpt2,9a73d50df49cc21893a7ccb109c9dc5e,Who papered the room?,Two friends,Narrator and their friends,gpt2,090c45d3ee7436888e13fb4016fe6d30

I wait for what seems like forever as the pump fills my tank and the dollar amount endlessly increases.",d932bbf04df01056bc91dc44c26b4fbb,How did they pay for the fuel?,Credit card,"yes , they insert",mhpg,53e47d0e7b7aceedface413e30eea3fe,Who paid for the fuel?,Owner/author.,The narrator,gpt2,d098bad86eb893f6815db3b05dc14c16,Who paid for the fuel?,Owner/author.,The author,gpt2,18bf8e64cf88217d0c8dc88ac844eea5,How did they pay for the fuel?,Credit card,they paid in cash,gpt2,7b871e09fd5a2938b9d13fb1f79e0f2c,Who paid for the fuel?,Owner/author.,Nobody,gpt2,fa7d8ab981c7c2f4cbffc30ff657b771,Where were they filling gas?,Their favorite gas station,At a gas station,gpt2,79e969e966772672405995e27ae3696c,Who drove to the gas station?,The owner/author.,The narrator,gpt2,2642f1c12eb7bb21dd61e64667ea6a0c,How did they pay for the fuel?,Credit card,they pay their fine,gpt2,fb009f8a95ce8f23f24d68a422df9a12,How long did it take to put fuel in the car?,a long time,It took me a moment to get to the pump.,gpt2,26b32e80716e793629c0ff7a1db96026,Who drove to the gas station?,The owner/author.,Author,gpt2,ed0652f4339165bf8afabcc4a0fd758c
"I planned to go to the shopping centre all week. Finally it was shopping day. I dressed comfortably, made my shopping list and grabbed my purse.  On my walk to the shopping centre  I thought about all the things I would buy. Most of the things on my list were items I needed. A tooth brush, some bread, pencils, socks. I had clipped some coupons and knew I would save a few dollars so that I could get that new game I like. I couldn't wait to see it on the shelf and actually hold it in my hands. I arrived at the shopping centre. It wasn't very busy and I was glad of that. First I did all of my important shopping. And sure enough I had enough money for the game. I rushed to the electronics section and sunk in despair when I saw the shelf was empty. They were sold out of the game I had waited so long to play. The store clerk saw my disappointment and offered me a rain check for when they got more stock in. It would be about 2 weeks' but there was hope. I gathered my things and went home. I marked my calendar for when my next trip to the shopping centre would be... in two weeks. Now all I could do was wait... patiently of course!",9682a3acf5d6cc7a6efd02d71b4e1e6f,What were they shopping for?,various items,a game,gpt2,152b24f4581a714fa998e8f7831ea28e,Where did they shop?,shopping center,The shopping centre,gpt2,f0660a1823ff79ef085ec5f3f061d4e5,Who paid for the purchases?,Narrator,The complainer,gpt2,1993a6bb570998642ff4e29c02d95e25,Who paid for the purchases?,Narrator,The girl.,gpt2,44eaabfd2bc56d5c6b7cd2760c805fad,What were they shopping for?,various items,"A toothbrush, toothpaste, coupon, and socks.",gpt2,bc2f6cc7fddcd8cb8bf691f8f2307627,Who paid for the purchases?,Narrator,sister,gpt2,9b2d404d9b989c0a480cbbb88ac1e01c,Did they walk around the store?,yes,No,gpt2,2ea94d468345e5833942dd1be26f8685,Where did they shop?,shopping center,at the mall,gpt2,4c97be0dea36ad5fdee69de9d8b032e9,Where did they shop?,shopping center,Online.,gpt2,ed96211ec2afd7ef84a788863beea913,What were they shopping for?,various items,goods for games,gpt2,66174ea38c701878786157570afc08a7
I really enjoy all sports and I find that playing tennis is an excellent way to stay in shape.  I just moved to a new neighborhood and there are some public tennis courts in the park across from my apartment.  I decided to take some tennis lessons during the winter to make sure that I would be ready to play when spring came.  I really enjoyed the lessons and I actually became a pretty good player.  I decided to join a recreational tennis league in my neighborhood.  I joined a women's singles league and I have had a really good time playing tennis once or twice a week.  It's very convenient to meet right at the neighborhood courts and play tennis for an hour in the evenings.  I even decide dot treat myself to a brand new tennis racket.  Tennis is a sport that I hope to continue playing as I get older.,e765c7ee6a1e13423b04dc6ea78ea39d,How did they get the tennis equipment?,They bought it themselves,They bought from online and found it online,gpt2,fd12b03859a0b6148d4e92134b952f78,Where were they playing tennis at?,The park by the author's house has a tennis court.,The tennis courts in their neighborhood,gpt2,4cb8211ff9a79b80c818ee125f6569c6,Was there an umpire?,"No, there was not.","No, his sister's",gpt2,23e6d0c9cc2908b461a81ce1e0c299a2,Was there an umpire?,"No, there was not.",no Not sure,gpt2,2d9583ef9a32f78d6e9c8b689be97793,Were they playing tennis in a park?,Yes they were playing in the park.,a tennis courts,mhpg,a1c556f11be5219c90ca6ca0914f3435,Where were they playing tennis at?,The park by the author's house has a tennis court.,The tennis courts in the park.,gpt2,e36891a1e225ee358283518f6493d397,How did they get the tennis equipment?,They bought it themselves,They bought tennis shoes.,gpt2,275ec27ef3cc9b0300709100966afc35,Were they playing tennis in a park?,Yes they were playing in the park.,Yes,gpt2,25969d5630c7edb6306975596cfcf162,Was there an umpire?,"No, there was not.",yes,gpt2,27f85268ec463b667c13465228280aed,How did they get the tennis equipment?,They bought it themselves,hired tennis racket,gpt2,75cd6ea14180d4eb84fac118c2cfc4a1

"I recently attended the wedding of two friends of mine from college.  It was a long drive away, so my date and I drove there in regular street clothes.  We changed into our formal wedding wear once we arrived at the hotel where we would be staying for the evening.  We drove to the church and walked in.  The wedding was about to start so we quickly found some seats near other friends of ours.  An organ began to play, which let us know that the ceremony was starting.  Members of the wedding party arrived in a procession.  The bride was the last to arrive at the altar.  A minister performed the ceremony.  The bride and groom exchanged vows and also exchanged rings.  When the ceremony finished, the couple kissed, and everyone applauded.

Deciding that I wanted to send a variety of different cards to my friends, I bought a few of each card until I had enough cards for everyone.

"I recently was at a sporting event and decided I was hungry and wanted to buy something to eat.  I spotted a vending machine tucked in the corner of a stairwell that sold small snacks and drinks.  I approached the vending machine and looked through the glass to decide what I wanted.  I found a bag of chips that I know I like and decided that is what I would buy.  I read the price of the chips was one dollar.  I reached into my wallet and retrieved the dollar needed to purchase the chips.

"I remember the day that my brother got married like it was yesterday. The ceremony was perfect. He and his bride found a quaint little winery nestled in Virginia, right smack dab in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley. I arrived that morning and checked into my hotel with my date. I feel like I was more nervous then my brother! I quickly showered and pulled on my suit, before heading down to the ceremony. I pulled aside my brother and gave him a hug. I told him how proud of him I was, and how happy I was for his bride to become a part of our family. He thanked me and we made our way down. I took my place up front, and as the seats began to fill, I could not have been happier. I saw the smiles on everyone's face. I barely remember anything the pastor said during the ceremony.

"I ride the bus to school everyday . I live in New York City so riding the bus is a common thing . Everyone does it because it is convenient . In our city , it is very packed , so driving is n't as convenient or affordable . Parking is expensive so public transportation saves us a lot of money . Every morning when I go to school , I wait by the bus stop . The morning bus comes every ten minutes . Once it arrives I board onto the bus and I insert my metro card . The metro card has a balance of money stored inside it . This money is subtracted from the balance every time I ride the bus and insert my metro card . Basically the metro card pays for the bus ride . When I run out of money , I go to a metro card machine and put more money into my balance . Riding the bus is annoying sometimes . In the morning , it is very crowded so sometimes there are n't enough seats for everybody . This means I have to stand while holding on to a pole . Sometimes its so crowded that I am sandwiched in between people . If I am lucky , sometimes there will be open seats .

"I rinsed the fresh wound with cold water, then held pressure on it for a few minutes with a dry paper towel. Once the wound stopped bleeding I gently applied some peroxide and let it dry. I then applied a thin layer of neo sporin. I had to search for band aids and eventually found one in the first aid kit in the car. I found an appropriate sized band aid removed the wrapper and threw the wrapper away. I peeled one side of the band aid sticky cover off, one sticky side exposed,  I stuck it on bare skin just to the side of the wound. I then peeled off the other side and gently pressed the band-aid to my skin, making sure the wound was centered and properly covered by the pad part of the band aid.

"I sometimes put a gift in a box, if it doesn't already have one, to make it easier to wrap. It's nice to put tissue paper inside the box, too. That makes opening the gift more interesting. After I have the gift boxed, I assemble my wrapping supplies. I use rolled wrapping paper, clear tape, scissors, and ribbon. Next, I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper. I  study it, trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll. I don't want to waste paper, but I also want to neatly cover the gift. Once I decide how much paper to cut off, I mark the place with pencil, then fold there, and cut the paper along the fold line. Now I turn the gift upside down, and position it in the center of my paper. I pull up one end of the paper, and tape it to the center bottom of the box. I pull the other end of the paper smooth, pull it around  the box and tape it in place too. Then I do the ends of the package, folding the paper down, cutting it shorter if I must, and smoothing it neatly around the gift box. I tape it in place, and decorate the box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made.",585ae76332d55ccabd3f605635367c79,Who came to help?,noone,They were the homeowner,gpt2,b423accd25d5db88fe70466dda9ed7e0,Who came to help?,noone,Help,gpt2,d09972bbed1f15b5eff7432cffdb82d2,Who offered to help them?,Nobody,Nobody asked,gpt2,c5678a8edb9702c2122ab557768edcdd,Who came to help?,noone,narrator,gpt2,67b0d516e5a86157391423db9bad90b9,Will she like opening the gift?,Yes she will.,No,gpt2,ac0f66af297057deac8818916790923d,Will she like opening the gift?,Yes she will.,Yes,gpt2,1d04e96da65c6d4589c099f5b581717f,did they put a bow on their gift?,Yes they did.,Yes,gpt2,96de165287a7a4755519c3dd0a573a3d,When did they use scissors to cut the paper?,After they measure.,before they store the gift.,gpt2,8e55531c3f2aa02ae63b4ebb12113c22,When did they use scissors to cut the paper?,After they measure.,After they finished folding the box,gpt2,3394fec5f8d031e903ef4b3162d432e0,Who offered to help them?,Nobody,a stranger.,gpt2,e8ec7d85e54f7db76a786e4994c76003
"I started talking to this girl on Facebook, she was part of a meme group I belonged to. I found out that she lived in the same state as me only an hours drive away.

Once I got there , I waited for the bus to arrive along with two other people . After about 15 minutes , an express bus heading to Manhattan arrived . I boarded the bus and paid the driver my fare . I then walked to a window seat near the front of the bus , that was free . It was pretty early , and the bus was initially somewhat empty . However , several stops later , the bus was filled with fellow commuters heading to work . Along the way , the bus passed through about 5 different towns while traveling on local roads , before headed out to the George Washington Bridge to get to Manhattan . While getting there , the bus ran into a traffic jam which caused a 20 minute delay . After working its way through traffic , the bus made it onto the bridge , and several minutes later , we were at the bus terminal on 178th Street .

"I wake up at about noon. I can't believe I missed my alarm clock again. I need to be at my sister's office in 20 minutes. Put on clothes as fast as I can and run outside and call an uber. An uber driver was fortunately just a few blocks away and snags me, so it appears that things are going well so far. I get into his car and am sweating and visibly stresses. The cab driver, a man named Marcus, asks how I am doing in a very down to Earth way. I let him know I am fine and was just in a rush.

The best prices I could find consisted of two layovers and included an overnight flight but I was willing to suffer a little bit to save a few hundred dollars. After I booked my flight I gave my Dad the information and he said he would schedule some days off to spend with me. I did some research on things I would like to do in Maui and decided I wanted to go whale watching and possibly snorkeling if the weather was nice. Dad made the reservations since he gets a discount as a resident. I also found some restaurants that I wanted to try. I thought about if I needed to buy anything before I went and decided to pack light and purchase essentials there to not risk my bag getting lost. The trip went as planned and was very relaxing and beautiful.,c7dd56cb7e7dc044d8bebff19176117a,Who planned the trip?,The person telling the story.,The narrator,gpt2,a0a2fe42b615ad0ab2f7cd954aa2fd44,Who would be going on the trip?,They will,The narrator,gpt2,3bd1c005b7a143ab69832a366b27cd91,Why did they pick that location?,That's where their dad lives.,yes,mhpg,d55893f39a417345adfa4796f21fd931,Why did they pick that location?,That's where their dad lives.,They wanted to visit their Dad in Maui,gpt2,b67ef1869404991c5025b302ab29bb7f,Who did they visit on their trip?,They were seeing their dad.,The narrator,gpt2,8bac2b1a56e9b35d472757ffa503d2c3,Will they need warm or cold weather clothes?,They needed warm weather clothes.,Warm weather clothes will do,gpt2,d0295fa72baaa8cfacf04267c0adca2c,Did they have fun?,"Yes, they had a nice time.",yes they did,gpt2,3e8b21e16304abeae37a959e5592e10b,Why did they choose the location they did?,it is where their dad lives,for an experience,gpt2,36b95887e18d3da08ba25518c6509626,Will they need warm or cold weather clothes?,They needed warm weather clothes.,They will need them at least warm weather clothes,gpt2,ff9981d45dc924f8b91a8e08d26d9e10,Who planned the trip?,The person telling the story.,the author,gpt2,f64c5950accba94de7b1447851b6acc7

I wanted to redo my master bathroom.  The bathroom was old and not up to date.  I looked at a bunch of magazines and different bathrooms to get inspiration on how I wanted my newly renovated bathroom to look.  I decided to do marble counters and ceramic floor tiles.  I also decided to redo the shower with a frameless glass shower door and chrome fixtures.  I then asked friends and family for referrals on contractors.  I contacted three different contractors that my friends referred to me as reliable and got some bids.  The bids were very close in price but different in when they could start and finish.  I picked the person who I thought gave me a realistic time frame on when the work could be done.  The work started and the contractor demolished the existing bathroom but then took over a week to come back and renovate the bathroom.  It took longer than I thought it would but the end result is great.  I love my new bathroom.

"I wanted to send invitations to 25 people I hoped would come to a birthday party for my boyfriend. I drove to a store that sells different types of cards, including packages of invitations.

"I wanted to watch a movie and decided to rent one form a store video rental. I drove to the store and entered the building. It was set up in sections according to movie genres; drama, comedy, horror, action, animated, thriller. I decided to head to the drama section. I looked through there available titles. I picked out a recent release and brought the empty box up to the counter. There the attendant took the film cover and went to find the corresponding film.

I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire. Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry. I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs. Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper. I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it. When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs. As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning. I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on them.,e473913e90455960177d392cda250e72,How long did it take to build the fire?,less than an hour,Less than a day,gpt2,d48ffbe5c1d63a4a7bf366198dbbcf50,who lit the fire,the teacher,and who,gpt2,4c169c773c947595743beeed332be2ce,who lit the fire,the teacher,The narrator,gpt2,de8d25f3dbcc0d3b0232cce1cabc800e,What did they use to make the bonfire?,wood logs,a newspaper,mhpg,440ac15b011a66d4feab4e2790861ce0,What did they use to make the bonfire?,wood logs,"Wood, sticks, and newspaper",gpt2,636f97176abde09741296ecdb286c9f5,Did they cook over the fire?,yes once there were a lot of hot coals,No they did not,gpt2,d0a07a0ab56065d2be064e4f05fc5f8a,Why were they having a bonfire?,they were teaching about cooking with a campfire,They were preparing to cook on their camps fire.,gpt2,685a1b19d069d8c78dd9a952065dee2b,Why were they having a bonfire?,they were teaching about cooking with a campfire,it was a hot,mhpg,83d66d699d667922e41b5db5757f6289,who lit the fire,the teacher,The person trying to cook the fire,gpt2,d7cf6db448696e17bfe3cc70873f9bb6,How long did it take to build the fire?,less than an hour,long enough for the wood to burn.,gpt2,4fd6035f0a8cca8686176f47d29c05b4

"I was bored and wanted to play a game. This time I decided I would go bowling. I drove to a bowling alley and payed the worker there to rent some bowling shoes. I put the shoes on to make sure they fit, and was told which lane would be mine to bowl in. I went to my lane with my bowling ball, which was just the right size and not too heavy. I stepped up to the line on the floor and swung the ball under my right shoulder onto the floor. The ball hit the floor and rolled quickly down the center of the lane. A lot of pins were lined up at the end of the lane, and my ball rolled right through the center of them. All the pins fell down and I scored a strike. I was very impressed, and a machine picked the pins back up for me and put them back at the end of the lane.

They began to call for my plane and I got on line . I gave the lady my visa and ticket and I boarded the airplane . I put the luggage above my head in the luggage department and sat down . My seat was next to a window so I was very happy about that . Soon a person sat down next to me . We were told to eventually put our seat belts on as we were ready to fly . We watched a short video on what to do in case we felt some turbulence and what to do in case of emergency .

"I was living in my very first apartment of my own, and my parents were coming to visit. However, the apartment was very dirty so I needed to clean it up quickly before my parents got there. I started with the kitchen. I put all of the dishes in the dishwasher and ran it. Then, I wiped off all of the counter tops and made sure that everything on the counters was neatly arranged.  I then moved onto the bathroom. I quickly scrubbed out the toilet and the bathtub, and wiped down the bathroom counter. I also made sure to clean the mirror. I moved onto my bedroom. I picked up all of my clothes off of the floor, rearranged the items on my dresser, and made my bed. Finally, I went to clean the living room.

"I was thirsty so I decided to make a cup of tea. I looked through my box of teas and rifled through the assorted flavors. I settled on Earl Gray, which is a black tea flavored with bergamot orange. I filled the kettle with water and placed it on the stove, turning on the burner so that it would heat up and begin boiling. In the meantime, I got out a teacup and saucer, and then removed the teabag from the package and placed it into the empty cup. After a time, the water on the stove began boiling, so I removed it from the stove top and poured a cup-size amount into the teacup. It filled the cup, covering the teabag, soaking it. I removed a spoon from the drawer and placed it in the cup, stirring gently as the contents of the teabag were released and began to color the water a light brown.

"I was very excited for my birthday party. About a month before my birthday, I helped my mom pick the date and location for my party. Mom called the local fun center and reserved the date. Mom told me I could invite ten friends. I was so excited! Mom got a notebook and I told her the ten friends I wanted to invite. After this, I got to pick my theme! Of course, I chose my favorite movie, Ghostbusters! We went to the party store and got decorations and invitations. Mom looked up my friends' addresses.

"I was walking to my car last night from work and was ready to drive home . I started the car up , but I noticed that I left my phone at work , so I turned the ignition back off , locked the car doors , and shut the driver door . Unfortunately for me , I shut the door WITH my keys still in the ignition . That 's right ; I was locked out of my own car . Flustered and embarrassed , I pulled at the handles of the doors and attempted to open the trunk off the car - no luck at all . I walked back to my office , got my phone , and contemplated what I would do next . There was no one there with me , so my only hope was riding the public bus -LRB- I did n't have money for a cab -RRB- . I waited for the bus , the last one of the night , at the bus stop . The bus driver opened the door for me and I came aboard . I paid the two dollar bus fare so that I could ride and asked him for a transfer so that I could get on the next bus at the terminal . I took my seat , and the bus took me to the terminal at the plaza . I got off the bus and hopped on the bus that would take me home . I handed the transfer to the driver and took my seat . As I approached my apartment , I pushed the button to request for the bus to stop . The driver pulled over , and I thanked them and got off . When I got in the apartment , I immediately jumped into my bed . I was dead-tired , and though I had the dilemma of having my keys locked in the car , I would figure that out in the morning .",eafa5c81581053faf02f640f55504b88,Who did they go to the bus stop with?,Nobody,The narrator,gpt2,bd677caeaac071445177c241b2df6307,Why did they take the bus?,They couldn't afford a cab,It would be too long,gpt2,ee26658b24b45899a879075ffec73136,Who drove the bus?,bus driver,The author,gpt2,43e6d12254af4473f1f083548de8abb3,Why did they take the bus?,They couldn't afford a cab,to work,gpt2,c5f9b442215d0bea5ae2a37bfe9c34d3,Who did they go to the bus stop with?,Nobody,A driver.,gpt2,8d7b550077a8acecc39440cc5f6a2717,Who did they go to the bus stop with?,Nobody,The girl doing the information,gpt2,07976f14a0d556aad1156f97cb732b55,Who did they go to the bus stop with?,Nobody,noody,backtranslation,feb9e8c0ce460b6da29aed83bf7db43b,Who drove the bus?,bus driver,the narrator's,gpt2,9263742586d38d7c876bc961720efc93,Why did they take the bus?,They couldn't afford a cab,They were tired,gpt2,2ace64d6cab14f2299594677845c62cd,Who drove the bus?,bus driver,the narrator and her partner,gpt2,26016382c354f08ce9fc0c4e4733fb6a

"I went for a driving lesson when I was sixteen years old. In my town, the driving lesson had to be 3 separate days of driving for two hours at a time. My driver was very cool and relaxed. Driving for the first time is a very nervous experience so it was good to have such a laid back guy as my instructor. It helped to put all of the worries to rest. I was very nervous at first. But we started driving around town and I got more used to it. In the instructor's car, they have pedals on their side of the car as well. So that is a comfort knowing that they can take control of the car if anything goes wrong. That really helped to make me worry a lot less.

"I went out to eat at a restaurant last weekend with my husband. We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but soon enough we were seated. The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel, and our waiter appeared right after we were seated. She was warm and friendly too. She greeted us and asked for our drink orders. My husband just wanted water, but I got an unsweet tea with lemon. We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on. We ordered our entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. Our waitress took the order, then promised to have our food out soon. We sampled the bread while she was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving, which we are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong. The smell was off and it had a bad taste. I thought it must be bad. I waited until our waitress was coming back by, then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different, because I felt like the salmon was going bad. She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. He said his was delicious. The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely. She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic. She kept checking on us throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert. He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. It was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed our meal, overall. Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal.

"I went to my favorite restaurant and ordered a chicken salad, something I had never gotten before. I waited patiently for my food. When it came, it looked really good. I took a few bites and something seemed off. It seemed too salty, and the chicken was a bit cold. I thought about just eating it, but decided it would be better to send it back. I waited for our waiter to return. When he did, I explained that my meal wasn't very good. I told him the chicken was served cold and the dressing was far too salty. He apologized and offered to get me a new one. I agreed. He went to the back and had the chef make me a new chicken salad.

"I went to the Dallas Museum of Art yesterday. It was so much fun. I took my friend Becky. She loves art. When we got there we bought our tickets. I liked the big entrance with all types of art all around. First we went to the painting area. There were many paintings. We could have spent the whole day looking at all the paintings and talking about them. One painting had a lady in front of a house. It looked simple, but my friend Becky explained the painting to me. The painting had meanings or symbolism in it. She said it was like a story looking at the lady's facial expression and how her house looked. Next we went to look at the sculptures. There were very old ones and some modern ones as well. I think I liked the paintings better.

"I went to the dentist yesterday. I brushed my teeth first, because dentists like that, and I left in plenty of time, so I wouldn't be late. When I got to the office, I told the man behind the counter who I was, and that I had an appointment with Dr. Tsutaoka. He told me to have a seat. I sat in the waiting room and watched the television a while. Soon, a woman came and led me back to a small room with a big padded chair. She had me sit in the chair, and tucked a sort of paper napkin around my neck. Then the dentist came in and smiled and said hi. She asked how I was feeling, and I said I was fine. She told me she was just going to look at my teeth, and she did. She pushed a button and the chair whirred and slowly tilted back. I opened wide, and she looked at my teeth one by one, using a small round mirror on a thin metal stick to see them. She said everything looked good, and I should keep brushing and flossing. I told her I would.

"I went to the swimming pool at the local YMCA recently. I decided to go towards 1 PM since there would be less people there. I do not like sharing a lane. Even though sharing is caring, I find it to be crowded in the pool and distracting sharing a lane. I drove to the YMCA, about 15 minutes. I then parked my car and went inside. I then changed into my bathing suit. I proceeded to swim for about 35 minutes. Mostly just the front crawl, and back stroke. I also used the kicking board for about 200 meters or 4 laps of a 50 meter pool. Finally, I finished my swim.

I placed the bacon on paper towels so it would drain.  I then poured some of the bacon grease from the pan into a aluminum can.  I heated the pan back up, and added the eggs.

"I woke up this morning alert and ready.  Before doing anything else, I knew I had to make my bed.  My mother hates when my bed is a mess.  I think it looks tidier when it's made too!  I threw all the pillows off of my bed onto the floor to get them out of the way.  Then I took the sheet and pulled it up to the head of the bed.  I walked around to the other side, making sure it was all even.  After the sheets were fixed, I did the same thing with the comforter.  I made sure everything was nice and wrinkle free.

I woke up this morning and when I turned on the bathroom light switch I noticed that one of the bulbs popped and burned out. I checked the closet where I normally keep light bulbs and could not find any. I removed the bulb to see what size I needed and made myself a note on a post it.

Another thing that makes them space age is that they take credit cards as well as cash. Today I don't have cash, so I get to go down to the vending machine with my card. I swipe the card and it tells me my card is accepted. Then I choose my item. Peanut M&M's. It's always peanut M&M's. I put in the letter and number of the item. The machine thinks about it for a second then drops my item. I bend over and push open the door at the bottom.

"I'm feeling thirsty. Fortunately, there's a vending machine that I can get a drink from here. Vending machines are special machines that automatically sell things like food, drinks, and other little things. Today, I'm going to buy a bottle of water from this machine. The first thing I do is put in my money. I put in one dollar, the price of the bottle I want. Then, I put in the number for the water. Every item in the machine has its own number, which you punch into a special pad to order it. Once I press the number, the machine pushes the bottle of water down, where it falls into a slot where I can pick it up from. Some machines instead grab the bottle and carry it down gently, especially of it carries bottles made from glass.

The homemade shower cleaner consist of  a spray bottle, 1 cup of dawn dishwasher liquid and 1 cup of vinegar and regular water. After I sprayed my homemade solution around the shower I let it sit for around an hour. After an hour, I grabbed a scrubbing brush and began to scrub away all the mildew stains that were in the shower. I find it best that you have the bathroom well-ventilated when you start scrubbing because you don't want to inhale all those nasty chemicals when your scrubbing away at your shower.

It had just about everything from arcade games to bowling to a bar, and they served great food. A usual visit to the bowling alley involved me and either a group of friends or family. We would start things off with an actual game of bowling. We would go over to the counter to check in and get our bowling shoes, followed by getting our lane. While one person set up the game of bowling, the rest of us would go and get the right sized bowling ball that we wanted. When everything was all set, we'd proceed with our game. I usually always came in last, since I'm not very good at bowling.

"It has been raining a lot and the lawn has been growing. So I mowed the lawn this morning. I had to go to the gas station to get some more gas to put into the lawn mower.

I think it needed some more oil. I but a bit of oil in and it started right up. I mowed in rows as I usually do. There were several sticks on the ground I had to pick up.

"It is Sunday. I am woken up rather violently by my elder brother, he enjoys this sort of thing, I don't. I asked him why he woke me up this early on a school holiday. He didn't answer and  just gave me a grin.  I tend to sleep till late on the days I don't have school. He said dad told him to and he had work for me. I immediately knew what it meant. I had to go and help him tend the gardens. I was still half- asleep when I reached our garden. And there I saw my dad with a shovel in his one hand and a little plant on the other. As soon as he saw me his eye gleamed. I kid you not his eyes literally gave me a sparkle. He came over to the door and handed me the shovel and the plant. He said since I was 11 I'm a big boy and have to help him and mom around the house and that of course includes gardening. My dad doesn't mind the dirt , but I do.

I knew it would be a waste of precious time to go home and change so I brought a change of clothes with me to the office. I freshened up and changed in the office bathroom. I am so lucky they have a actual shower in here. So me and my friends had already decided which pub we'd hit this week, it was ""The Hive"". It was named so because it was always ""buzzing"" with people . Stupid or clever? I don't know. So the four of us , Clay , Justin , Tony and myself had to reach the pub by 8:00. I pulled up my phone to book a cab. First I opened ""ola"" the app took a lot of time to load probably because the internet speed was slow. After a minute the app finally opened and show no cabs around. Then I opened ""Uber"" it loaded almost instantly and there were cabs available near me but due to high demand it had surge pricing(more than usual rate). I had no option but to take the Uber at a high price, since we rarely get time to hangout.",f501067026c93a3688169ccdf19d941b,Where were they heading?,to The Hive bar,They hadn't yet come back.,gpt2,c1882e3ee29ffe63d62a5b813687d229,How did they call for the taxi?,on a cell app,"yes , they brought a change and clothes",mhpg,527c09f2b2b4aef0720c68acef00e7f0,When did they call for a taxi?,Before going to the pub.,On Friday.,gpt2,83054fa5b0832a61fe42c11eabb579f4,When did they call for a taxi?,Before going to the pub.,Friday afternoon,gpt2,78326248d4b9c7f242345f79fde50768,How did they call for the taxi?,on a cell app,They called from the office.,gpt2,9870ea73e151f1a6e5c8fe0e4c7fa379,Who went on the ride?,The person telling the story,nobody got in,gpt2,e61cbe0856b2069ebc1628b8090f2cbc,When did they call for a taxi?,Before going to the pub.,Friday,gpt2,4fcd9b5bea8b8b01f458855173408c57,Where were they heading?,to The Hive bar,The Hive,gpt2,f466c4421b4bd9a56a8e94962126b570,How did they call for the taxi?,on a cell app,called at the coffee shop,gpt2,81882079f7350c92b981503c117b232e,Where were they heading?,to The Hive bar,the office,mhpg,7dfe527923467bdece5df9e836730d8c

"It was a beautiful summer night, and my sister and I decided to make a bonfire. We went outside to see if we had enough firewood and discovered that we didn't have enough wood for our fire. I decided to go out into the forest to pick up some more wood while my sister used the wood we had to get a fire started. I walked around for ten minutes picking up any stray logs, branches or twigs that I could find.

They were the most amazing eggs that I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was not just the combination of being in a new place and starting new that made the eggs better.

"It was a sunny day and my sister and I were outside playing away the day. We decided it would be a good idea to have scooter races. With her on her red scooter and me on my blue scooter, we raced down the sidewalk at top speeds. Before I knew it, she began to wobble uncontrollably in front of me. She tried to jump off into the grass before crashing, but she landed hard on the pavement. I rushed to help her and noticed her knee was bleeding quite a bit. We walked slowly home to tend to her wounds. I took her into the bathroom and washed off her wound with soap and water. I then dried her wound with a clean towel.

"It was a very hot sunny Saturday morning and me and my family decide to go to the beach. Before going to the beach we had to pack the car. We packed some snacks. We packed a cooler with all our drinks and water. We put on our bathing suits and brought towels, beach chairs, a beach umbrella, beach toys, and a beach ball. Mom brought sun tan lotion to protect us from the sun. Once we got to the beach mom and dad setup all off the chairs, umbrella and towels. Mom laid down on a towel while dad went running to the ocean. We swam but not too far because the water was very deep. There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards. There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles. Dad helped us build our sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in it would fill in our pool. At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water. There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguard had to blow his whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach. I have heard that sometimes you can see shark in the ocean but lucky for us we did not see any sharks. Visiting the beach was very fun for the whole family as mom can relax and get a tan and dad could play and swim with us.",de15fc4acf236f2bd9e6876158526f2a,How did they keep lunch cold?,probably with a cooler,They kept their cooler in the cooler.,gpt2,b187468a295d01313a53572c55e1fda0,Did they bring food?,yes,ja,backtranslation,2aa88a5f32695bffdae6af053e930cb5,Did they sunbathe?,yes,"Yes, they swam",gpt2,40564af605601143e1979557195b7437,How did they keep lunch cold?,probably with a cooler,Shirt was cold,gpt2,bb5cbc744cb0d9772ce0814c53ec6ef9,Did they sunbathe?,yes,No,gpt2,a0e2bce87deec3809da8fdc0ce429ecc,Did they bring food?,yes,No food.,gpt2,e97dbc05b29dc5998c79f9e048690bbb,How did they keep lunch cold?,probably with a cooler,They had some snacks.,gpt2,a33de0011b10cecfa966bf64781e5b17,Did they bring food?,yes,"yes , they all a drinks",mhpg,e8904a1d9f087c0c3608b864599ca346,Did they ride the waves?,no,Yes,gpt2,0c27239b9ceb838e30c234caf46e1347,Did they ride the waves?,no,"no , no",backtranslation,a905f7af68408d5a044faf7ac22886e6

"It was summertime and I was very thirsty. I wanted to drink orange juice very badly, but I did not have any orange juice. Luckily I had an orange tree in my backyard. I picked some good and ripe oranges to juice. In the kitchen, I brought out my electric juicing machine and plugged it in. I washed the outside of each orange to make sure my juice did not get dirty. Then, I cut each orange in half and turned the juicer on. This kind of juicer worked by spinning a plastic piece inside the juicy part of the orange when you held the orange against it.

"It was the first warm sunny weekend in May, so I was excited to head up into the mountains and camp. I checked through my camping box to make sure I had camp stove fuel, batteries for the flashlights, camp utensils, bug spray and everything else I might need. I also double checked to make sure all the stakes and poles were with my tent. Lastly I loaded up a cooler with food and snacks. I rounded up the kids and we got into the car. We drove half an hour away on the highway before turning onto a Forest Service Road. After about 15 minutes we pulled into a campground. We selected a spot, looking for one that was well shaded and set back from the road. The kids took the tent out and began putting poles together. I helped them stake out the tent. Then we gathered up firewood together and placed it in the fire ring. I got some matches from the box and lit some of the smaller twigs. I poked around the fire until it began to burn well and then started to get out some food for dinner.",8b35e1ca1d23a68955c80ad447989f2e,How did they pick this area?,They wanted to go to a campsite,Grocery store,gpt2,9acc412ee3b01c0dc3cbabf04429759c,How did they pick this area?,They wanted to go to a campsite,they were going to go to the mountains,gpt2,b0a758fc161a29f72ce7286e4a660c08,How long did it take to get to the campground?,About 45 minutes,Around 15 minutes,gpt2,3aa0e3face7840e8bed85d3591b12a6d,Why did they choose that location for the trip?,They wanted a spot that was well shaded and set back from the road.,the narrator was well,mhpg,875bcfe8bc79b5e4d3e8c86013abde32,How long did it take to get to the campground?,About 45 minutes,20 minutes,gpt2,350770d87c074e5b964e67274957099c,Why did they choose that location for the trip?,They wanted a spot that was well shaded and set back from the road.,It was a nice place to camp.,gpt2,a028e20de35e047c67c47c9bb886bfdb,How did they pick this area?,They wanted to go to a campsite,One they owned.,gpt2,d22ad9c3fe72a8253cb03af173eb8ec7,How long did it take to get to the campground?,About 45 minutes,yes,mhpg,3973ec6476e468b87979fdae1f530ae3,Why did they choose that location for the trip?,They wanted a spot that was well shaded and set back from the road.,The mountains.,gpt2,b2ec7ca2d2a9089fded106770c553f1d,How long did it take to get to the campground?,About 45 minutes,10 minutes,gpt2,f2f957d5a22554c92f819077686af108

"Judy came home and walked past the bathroom. She noticed the shower was looking a little grimy. Going straight to the kitchen, she grabbed everything she would need to deep clean the shower. A bucket, a sponge, shower cleaner, a baggie for trash, a scrubbing pad, and a large bucket. Going in, she started by running the shower on very hot to wet down the whole shower area. Being careful not to burn herself, she waved the shower head back and forth to get all the corners wet. Then, she sprayed the shower cleaner all over the shower and organized her counter while she waited a few minutes to let it soak in. Using the sponge, she scrubbed and scrubbed to get all the build up off. She then turned the shower back on and rinsed all the tile and the fixtures, using the sponge now and again to spread the water around. She put all the debris in the baggie, and threw it away in the kitchen.

"Just recently, the light in my hallway went out, and since my younger brother is afraid of sleeping in the dark, this became an unnecessary problem.

"Katie and Jesse from next door came over and left an invitation to have a barbecue pitch in at their house. As, we packed the kids up, I made some potato salad while I waited for them to fight and argue, and finally put their shoes and jackets on so we could leave. ""Kevin,: I yelled as I got to the front door, ""Don't forget to bring the big cooler over in the car when you get up and around. My husband Kevin had just had surgery on his back, and it took him a lot longer to get up and around. He definitely couldn't make the quarter of a mile trek down to Katie and Jesse's.

I'll save you a cheeseburger,"" I teased as I kissed him goodbye. He grinned at me and beeped my nose, ""I love you Sally Jean,: He said with an exaggerated southern drawl.

I set out from my apartment with a spring in my step , because it was an amazing day . I walked through my apartment complex 's parking lot to reach the bus stop , where I waited for the bus around 5 minutes . When it came to a stop in front of me , I boarded and put a $ 1 bill and 2 quarters in the fare machine . I selected a seat near the entrance , because it has more space and fewer people . Riding the bus often gives me motion sickness , so I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the swaying motion as it rolled down the street . Behind me , two college students were eagerly discussing a class project . In the very back , a small child was loudly pretending to be a dinosaur . I was glad when I finally reached my destination . I pulled the cord signaling that I would need the bus to stop next to the hospital , and got up to exit out the bus 's side door .

"Last Tuesday was another typical workday. Following my daily 1:00 meeting, I was struck with some hunger pains. I reached into my pocket and felt around - fortunately I had some spare change. I stood up from my desk with a smile on my face and started to make my way down the hall. It was the perfect time for an afternoon snack. What would I want? There were so many options. I could opt for something healthy, maybe a granola or a kind bar. Or maybe, perhaps, it was the perfect time to indulge in some chocolate. On the other hand, I could always play it safe and get some popcorn or even some potato chips. I arrived at the vending machine and glanced at my options. Fully stocked! What luck!

"Last night I decided I was going to go dancing. My husband, daughter, sisters and their husbands and nieces went out to a nice place where a lot of people go. We got to the place we were going dancing. There was a guy at the door checking ID's to make sure there wasn't anyone under the age of 21 going in. Of course we were all over 21 so there weren't any issues. We all went in and found us a table. We then decided to order some drinks and about that time a waitress came over and asked us what we would like to have. We all gave her our order and she went to get the drinks. While she was away a good song started playing and we all decided to dance. We all went out on the dance floor and danced until the end of the song.

"Last night I decided I was going to go dancing. My husband, daughter, sisters and their husbands and nieces went out to a nice place where a lot of people go. We got to the place we were going dancing. There was a guy at the door checking ID's to make sure there wasn't anyone under the age of 21 going in. Of course we were all over 21 so there weren't any issues. We all went in and found us a table. We then decided to order some drinks and about that time a waitress came over and asked us what we would like to have. We all gave her our order and she went to get the drinks. While she was away a good song started playing and we all decided to dance. We all went out on the dance floor and danced until the end of the song.

"Last night after dinner, I had ""dishwasher duty."" That means that it was my turn to do the dishes and unload the dishwasher. After the dishwasher had washed the dishes, I first opened the door to the dishwasher. I unloaded the bottom rack first. That way, if any water drips or leftover food were stuck on the dishes still, they wouldn't trickle down to my clean dishes. The bottom drawer usually has my plates in it. After unloading the bottom drawer, I unloaded the top drawer, which usually contains my cups, utensils, and my bowls. I use a towel to dry off any leftover water drips.

After unloading the bottom drawer, I unloaded the top drawer, which usually contains my cups, utensils, and my bowls. I use a towel to dry off any leftover water drips.

"Last night, I had a party at my house. Many people were there and most of my friends hung out in both the kitchen and the living room. The living room was fine, but the kitchen was a disaster. I felt the need to clean the floor and in an effort to do so, I took out a mop and mopped up the floor. This took some of the stickiness away and made it feel much better.

I gave her a towel to dry off with and helped her get into her pajamas. After she brushed her teeth, we went to the bedroom.

"Last week I went to an art museum.  I got there early in the day so that I would have lots of time to look at everything.  The museum had many kinds of art.  There were paintings and drawings.  There were ceramics.  There were sculptures.  I went to see the paintings first.  There were some paintings by famous artists.  Other paintings were by artists I had never heard of.  I enjoyed the paintings of still life, such as flowers and fruit.  Next I went to see the ceramics display.  Some of the pottery was over 1,000 years old.  The designs on the pottery were detailed and very pretty.  Some of the pieces were brightly colored and others were brown and beige.  Some of the pottery was damaged and pieces were missing. There was some Chinese pottery and it had colorful dragons painted on it.   I enjoyed looking at all of the different styles and designs.  Finally I went to see the sculptures.  I liked the sculptures of horses.  There was a sculpture of a man riding on a horse that I particularly liked.  The man was an Indian and was wearing only pants and a feather in his hair.

"Last week my friend and I went to the public swimming pool nearby where we live. It was a beautiful day outside - a sunny 80 degrees with not a cloud in sight. When we arrived we found an empty spot and put our towels down, along with the items we brought for the day which included some snacks, suntan lotion, books, drinks, and a change of clothes. There were many people there, including lots of children with their parents and some adults alone or with friends. Shortly after we arrived, we put on suntan lotion and took a dip in the pool. It was just the right temperature. Cool, but not too cold. We swam around for a bit and then got out and laid on our towels for a while. We relaxed in the sun and had a nice chat about what was going on in our lives while we ate some snacks.

"Last week my friend and I went to the public swimming pool nearby where we live. It was a beautiful day outside - a sunny 80 degrees with not a cloud in sight. When we arrived we found an empty spot and put our towels down, along with the items we brought for the day which included some snacks, suntan lotion, books, drinks, and a change of clothes. There were many people there, including lots of children with their parents and some adults alone or with friends. Shortly after we arrived, we put on suntan lotion and took a dip in the pool. It was just the right temperature. Cool, but not too cold. We swam around for a bit and then got out and laid on our towels for a while. We relaxed in the sun and had a nice chat about what was going on in our lives while we ate some snacks.

"Last week when I took a trip into the city I had to ride on the underground to get from one place to another.

When I got to the station, I walked down the stairs that led into the underground and went over to the kiosk so I could pay my fee. After I paid my fee I took the ticket and went through the turnstile towards the train. I had to wait with a group of people for the train to arrive, but it didn't take very long. When the train got to my station the doors slowly slid open and everyone walked inside. We found our seats and waited patiently for the train to start moving. I didn't take long.

"Last week, I decided that it was time to start mowing the lawn for the season. I got the mower out of the garage and put it out back.

She asked me to make her some coffee too!  I had to grind up some more beans.  I put some filtered water in a microwave safe container.  I put the container into our microwave, which was three years old!  I had to heat up the water for six minutes because our microwave is not that fast.  I placed a filter on top of a coffee cup for my wife.  I filled the filter up with the coffee I had ground.  I tamped down the coffee grounds with my hand.  Then I carefully poured the hot water from the microwave over the coffee grounds.  I allowed the water to soak into the coffee grounds, and I allowed the grounds to come to rest in the filter.

"Last weekend, my friend and I decided it would be a good time to paper our living room. The previous residents of the house we live in had used wallpaper on the living room walls that was a very odd shade of red, which we thought looked strange. We wanted the living room to get a new color of wallpaper, and we wanted to choose a color that would match our personality. We first went to Sherwin-Williams, which is a paint and wallpaper store. We looked at the wallpaper color samples and picked up a few brochures with examples of how the samples would look on our walls. We decided that a cheery yellow color would look best on our walls, and selected that color. We then returned to Sherwin-Williams and purchased the yellow wallpaper.

"Last weekend, my wife and I had some friends over.  After the party ended, we decided that we wanted to watch a movie.  I decided to run to the Redbox booth to get a new movie that was out.

"Last year, when  I threw a party for my girlfriends birthday, I prepared a nice party with family and friends both excited. My first task was finding a day that would work and trying to be discrete about it. This was difficult because we are both busy and also because I had to alert both of our friends to invite while making sure that none of them gave away the secret. I also had to figure out how I was going to get my girlfriend to the party without telling her that we were having a party for her. After establishing all of these details, I planned the party and sent invites, planned the food, and planned some gifts. This experience was good, but was somewhat difficult . As a the party went on, my girlfriend enjoyed it and appreciated my effort.

"Laying on my side, in bed staring out the window...it must only be 6 a.m. I hear a thud, the same thud I hear every day around this time, with the exception of Sundays. The paper is here. I slowly swing my legs around out of the bed and stand up, reaching to the adjacent chair I grab my robe and put it on. It is soft and red like a micro plush blanket. I shuffle stiffly down the stairs and to the door, turn both locks...this sound prompts my great dane to come running down the stairs thinking there is an intruder...

"Making a bed in a hotel as a cleaning maid consists of stripping off the linens. The blanket  & cover are not washed unless really bad. The linens are picked up for the laundry. There are two flat sheets. The first flat sheet is spread across the bed and tucked tightly using a special fold so it won't undo itself. The send flat sheet is spread out, then the blanket.  Folding the top edge over the blanket, both are tuck between the mattress and spring board. Pillows  are put into clean pillow sacks and the top cover is laid over and tucked under the pillows. Some motels put a mint chocolate on the pillow but most don't. A real fancy hotel would have a flat sheet on top of the blanket as well as below it because that isn't washed everyday.

"My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish. Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market.  When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up.  When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones. Some of the fish he buys still has the head, fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too. The head of the fish is really good to make fish soup. I like it better when he leaves the scales (skin) of the fish as it tastes really good. There are many different ways that he cooks the fish. Sometimes he will  fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it.  He also bakes the fish in the oven which makes it soft and tender. My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi.  In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it.  My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain.",5872f1f0300834dcd2af5b94d472fa54,Who is cooking the fish?,his dad,The author,gpt2,ecc0a608864a529bab247fba02474a5b,Who is cooking the fish?,his dad,The narrator,gpt2,5ca69f2cf5a0805234682f678b58dff9,Why did they use the oven?,bake fish,Mom ordered the fish cooking the pan and the oven.,gpt2,8ccd2eab7b1e74ff036239a356199829,why were they cooking fish?,hungry,They like it,gpt2,d4431d865420d280d51930a5c169ff11,how many people helped cook the fish?,0,yes,mhpg,1b972d720b5f7e280901e6fd0b8bc303,Why did they use the oven?,bake fish,it is easier,gpt2,8fb7054362808f4e2cb725888370de4b,why were they cooking fish?,hungry,it is a good dish to eat,gpt2,eb73dd4c1d5ed0521d802c62ffb94e2e,why were they cooking fish?,hungry,they were hungry,gpt2,8fe521f09f04ab73f07e08bb3fde6e95,why were they cooking fish?,hungry,it was dirty,mhpg,ff3cf02fac2d2660eddbed7ce4d86969,Who is cooking the fish?,his dad,Dad,gpt2,f8093391ca9a8b23ea6680c84f6416d8

My daughter and I had to go to the airport to get on a airplane to go on a trip.  We got there early in the morning so we could have a lot of time.  We  checked to see if we could still get on the plane on time.  We checked to see if we had our passports which we had to have if we wanted to go on a plane.  We had to make sure we were at the right place because we didn't want to get lost.  We had to find our airplane.  You can get lost on them like you can a bus.  We found it.  We still had fifty minutes so we went in the airport restaurant to get a cup of coffee and a donut.  The donut was delicious.  It had jelly in the middle.

"My family and I are going on a trip, so I need to pack my suitcase. First I thought of where we are going so I know what kind of clothes I need. We are going to the beach so I know it will be hot. I took my suitcase out and opened it. I started by putting my sandals and extra pair of shoes towards the bottom. Then i packed my nice and folded pair of pants and some shorts also.

"My friend Thomas was going out of town and asked if I could feed his fish. I said I would of course. Getting into his building was more the challenge. I had to sign in with the front desk, designate my parking place and give my license plate before the door man would let me in the building. I cross the lobby and head upstairs. As I enter the apartment, I see the fish tank. They look happy and very active. The sun is shining in through a window across the room and there is a table next to the tank with a container of fish food. I read the container to make sure I understand the instruction. Thomas said to give the fish two nice size pinches of food. You can't give them too much or it will sink and make the water murky. I try to get just the right amount.

"My friend and I left our hotel early, about 6:30. The walk took about fifteen minutes to the station. We had to walk down a long flight of stairs down to the station. We took out our automatic payment cards, walked up to the barrier, and swiped them across the electronic reader. The barrier opened to let us in. We walked up to the map that shows how the different train lines run. We confirmed that we would have to change trains halfway there. We looked at the signs to locate the platform we needed, and walked down another flight of steps to catch our train. We waited on the platform at a safe distance until the train came roaring in. After it came to a stop and the other passengers got off, we entered the train. It was mostly empty and we were able to find seats. At the third stop we got off and quickly walked up another flight of steps to locate the platform for the next train. In two minutes our next train arrived and we got on.

"My friends and I decided to go bowling a few weeks ago. We met up at the local bowling alley around 6PM and walked inside together. The place was packed, but we managed to find a free lane and sat down. A few of us went up to the counter to pay for a few games for each person. We each then went up to the rental counter to rent some bowling shoes.

"My husband and I decided that while our son was off at college it would be a good time to renovate his room. It still had cartoony race car trim up and the carpet had seen better days. It's always best to start off with a plan so we sat down a talked about how we wanted the room to look. It is still our son's room when he needs to visit from college so it couldn't be entirely out of his taste.

"My husband and I decided that while our son was off at college it would be a good time to renovate his room. It still had cartoony race car trim up and the carpet had seen better days.

Next we got in and fastened our seat belts, then I checked the side mirrors and rear view to make sure I could see.

I pulled the gear shift towards me and pulled down one click going from P (park) to R (reverse). I check the mirrors once more and turned my head to the right to look over my shoulder to back out of the driveway.

"My sister recently came to visit in New York. Since she loves hot dogs, I decided to treat her to some homemade hot dogs. We went shopping at the  supermarket for the  ingredients. When we got back, it was about noon so we got into the kitchen to prepare the lunch. We had brought some meat , paprika garlic and some celery. After frying the  celery, we mixed it with the paprika and garlic and used it to add flavor to the meat. I stuffed meat into the casings while my sister cut the buns. We then set the sausages to cook in the oven for about thirty minutes.

"My son and I decided that we wanted to go camping somewhere not too far from where we live. I looked online and found a campsite that had lots of activities. There was a lake and some biking trails so we would bring our swimsuits and our bicycles. The website said that the campground was first come first serve so we decided to get there early, around 3pm. We loaded the car with the tent and sleeping bags and some food to grill over the fire. When we got to the campground they assigned us a spot near the lake. We went to the campsite and unloaded our tent and set it up. We purchased some firewood at the store so we could have an evening fire. With things all ready for sleeping we put on our swimsuits and headed down to the lake. After our swim we went back to the campsite and started our fire.

"My stomach woke me up this morning. It was rumbling so loud, at first I thought it was an earthquake! I jumped out of bed and ran to the kitchen. I knew that I was going to need something that would fill my empty stomach up, so I decided to make an omelette. I opened the fridge and grabbed a carton of eggs and some mixed vegetables I chopped up last night. Then I opened the cabinet to get a bowl to mix my eggs in. I scrambled the eggs up with a fork, and then got a pan to put on the stove to cook the eggs in. After I turned on the stove, I put some a little bit of oil in the pan so the eggs wouldn't stick. I hate when that happens, it always makes cleaning up after really hard! Then I poured the eggs from the bowl into the pan and waited for the eggs to start to firm up. I poked at them with a spatula, pushing parts from the edge of the pan that were kinda firm slowly towards the middle of the pan. The uncooked runny eggs slide over to where the firm eggs were and cook up really quick! When there was no more runny eggs left, I turned off the stove and spread my mixed veggies on one side of the omelette.

"My stomach woke me up this morning. It was rumbling so loud, at first I thought it was an earthquake! I jumped out of bed and ran to the kitchen. I knew that I was going to need something that would fill my empty stomach up, so I decided to make an omelette. I opened the fridge and grabbed a carton of eggs and some mixed vegetables I chopped up last night. Then I opened the cabinet to get a bowl to mix my eggs in. I scrambled the eggs up with a fork, and then got a pan to put on the stove to cook the eggs in. After I turned on the stove, I put some a little bit of oil in the pan so the eggs wouldn't stick. I hate when that happens, it always makes cleaning up after really hard! Then I poured the eggs from the bowl into the pan and waited for the eggs to start to firm up. I poked at them with a spatula, pushing parts from the edge of the pan that were kinda firm slowly towards the middle of the pan. The uncooked runny eggs slide over to where the firm eggs were and cook up really quick! When there was no more runny eggs left, I turned off the stove and spread my mixed veggies on one side of the omelette. Then I used my spatula to fold the omelette in half so that the mixed veggies were in between the sides of the omelette, kind of like a sandwich. I put my omelette on a plate and took it over to my table to sit down and eat. My stomach roared like a lion when I looked down at the omelette.

"My table has gotten all sticky from dinner, so it is time to clean it. Cleaning the table helps make the table last longer and keep bugs out, so it is good to do. Some tables can be cleaned with a wet rag, but some tables are especially dirty so they need cleaning chemicals. My table is really dirty and made of stone so I find a good cleaning spray to use on it. The spray I chose is good for stone and doesn't hurt it, and it also gets rid of the stickiness and dirt on the table. I spray the table with not too much of the chemical, and then use some paper towels to rub the table. I make sure I rub the whole table and rub off any dirt or stickiness. After the whole table is rubbed off, I make sure there are no chemicals left on the table and that it is dry.

"My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married . He lives there and said that he would pick us up from the airport . But , the weather here was cold and there was freezing rain , so our flight was delayed for two hours . It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go . People on the flight were pretty happy to finally leave and a lot of people were having drinks . Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas . The flight itself took a little over four hours due to the fact that we had a non-stop flight . I was glad I paid the extra money for not making any stops . Six hours sitting on an airplane is more than enough for me . The flight was pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was a good thing , especially since my wife hates to fly .

"My wife had a stressful week at work and the weekend had finally come. I knew she needed to relax and feel pampered, so I arranged for us to visit the local sauna.

We parted ways to go into the appropriate locker rooms and change into our robes and the swimwear we brought along. After changing we had our massages, relaxing all parts of our bodies. Then we both went into a private sauna room and closed the wooden door. There was a pot of hot coals in the middle of the room and we had been instructed how to use it.

"Now we stood here in the line in front of the large glass window with people inside. Once our turn came up, we bought tickets to the movie we wanted to watch. The showtime wasn't for another 30 minutes. So we decided to go the arcade next door and play some games. They have real old classic arcade games there.  Remember Galaga? Donkey Kong? Even the old Star Wars simulator. That was my favorite game when I was a kid...  Once we're inside the theater, we bought some candies, popcorn, and some drinks.

"On Saturday night, I decided to go bowling with four of my good friends.  When we got to the bowling alley, we paid the cashier.  Then we each got shoes to go bowling in and selected our bowling balls.  We had to try a few balls by picking them up to see how it felt when we held it.  After everyone had their shoes and their balls, we went to our assigned lane.  Once there, we had to set up the computer that keeps track of the scores by putting in our names.

"On Saturday night, I decided to go bowling with four of my good friends.  When we got to the bowling alley, we paid the cashier.  Then we each got shoes to go bowling in and selected our bowling balls.  We had to try a few balls by picking them up to see how it felt when we held it.

On a Tuesday afternoon I had a flight reservation to go to Cancun Mexico. So I took a taxi to the airport and arrived there 3 hours early because when you have an international flight that is the require time.  I made my way to where my airline was located at and I decided to use one of the self check in kiosk which make it very easy to check in. All that you need is to have your passport ready if you are going to be going on an international flight if not all you need is a photo ID but in this case my flight was international. After your boarding pass is printed you need to take your luggage to get it checked in a well and it gets weighted and if its over the specific weight that is allowed you might be asked t pay an excess weight fee.,2e1f64e64aa2e7e37800c0a7213ac8ed,Where were they flying to?,Cancun Mexico,Mexico Mexican,backtranslation,e6d20efea9077d8af714b0855ce24f5b,Why did they arrive to the airport early?,it's required to allow enough time to get processed and screened through security,To relax.,gpt2,4ac6035d873a561c03565e730c2d9c61,Where are they going?,Cancun Mexico,Mexico Mexican,backtranslation,f61b391835aeaaa4e577a53a0c9bb3d8,Why did they arrive to the airport early?,it's required to allow enough time to get processed and screened through security,The flight was very early,gpt2,06cab6d52a5b93f90b1a223fd10150e5,Why did they arrive to the airport early?,it's required to allow enough time to get processed and screened through security,"in order to ensure processing and viewing through the security system , it requires .",backtranslation,ca71950433c6b0f0b66063059f1c0c41,Why did they arrive to the airport early?,it's required to allow enough time to get processed and screened through security,Because they wanted to get home to the flight.,gpt2,021429783af39c6465677e1b8187ca03,Where are they going?,Cancun Mexico,to Cancun Mexico,gpt2,52194a6e20d388d310c720c225c460a7,Why did they arrive to the airport early?,it's required to allow enough time to get processed and screened through security,it was a flight,mhpg,772af71c93aecfdf5e265a87e8eb9bac,Where are they going?,Cancun Mexico,to the airport,gpt2,604bec334d1241f28e59126ad57a7df3,Where are they going?,Cancun Mexico,To take home a selfie,gpt2,8e833245e351cc22114990bfc445359f

"On a hot summer day nothing is better then going to a swimming pool.  There is one at the community center by us so we can walk there.  Before we go, we get into our bathing suits and put on our flip flops.  We make sure to pack snacks, and towels and drinks into a bag, and grab a float and a ball to play with.  We walk to the pool, the hot day making us even more excited to going swimming.  Once there, we hurry to find empty lounge chairs to put our towels on and waste no time getting into the pool.  The water feels so cold at first, but its so refreshing.  We swim around and realize we have friends there.  We play a game with the ball for a while before getting out for snacks.  We dry out in the sun while we eat and drink and when we are hot again we get back into the water to swim some more.

"Once upon a time, it was time for a little girl to eat her breakfast before going to school.  It doesn't really matter what the little girl's name was, but we'll call her Jenny.

"One afternoon I was feeling thirsty and decided to make myself a pot of tea. I grabbed my tea kettle and dumped out all the water that was sitting in there and replaced it with fresh cool water.

One day I was thinking about my grandma who lives in Florida.  I thought it would be nice to write her a letter.  I sat down at the table and took out a pen and paper.  I wrote to her telling her all about the things going on in my life.  I told her about how I went to my friend's birthday party and how I was looking forward to my vacation in August.  I told her how my friends and I planned a trip to Washington D.C. for vacation.  I signed the letter and folded it up.  I carefully placed the letter into the envelope and addressed it to my grandma.  I put a stamp on the letter and I walked down to the post office.  I gave my letter to the postman and he put it in the mail to go out the next day.

"One day my mother took me out to a bowling alley to spend time with my family and it was a new experience for me since I usually never go out and get socially active with people, But once I was out there long enough and started to loosen up and have fun with my family it was a very fun experience and we all laughed and joked around. We had a team battle where all the girls took on the boys at one point my team being the boys were down and we needed a major comeback and eventually what happened was I was able to bring the boys back into the game.

"One day, I woke up for work and was shocked because it was light outside. This meant I was late for work! I looked at my alarm clock and realized that it was totally blank. My alarm clock had died! I quickly called my boss and explained why I would be late, and made sure to make a note in my phone to stop at the store later to pick up some replacement batteries. On my way home from work, I pulled into the hardware store to pick up some batteries. However, I realized that in my rush that morning I forgot to look at what kind of batteries I needed!

"One of my lights in my lamp went out yesterday so I investigated to see what was the matter.  I checked and the lamp was plugged and circuit breaker not tripped so I checked the bulb in the lamp.  Further inspection revealed the bulb was brown so I knew it had burned out and needed replacement.  Not having any extra in the house, I decided to go to the local Home Depot to buy the bulb I need.

"One of the buttons came off on my shirt, so I have to sew it back on. Sewing a button can be tricky, since you need a very steady hand. I get some thread and a sewing needle and get to work. I carefully put the button on my shirt, and start sewing. I tie a knot on the end of my thread, and put the needle through the underside of my shirt to where the button is. I guide the needle from under the shirt through one of the holes in the button, and then back through another hole. I do this many times, alternating between the four holes to make sure the button's on tight. There are a lot of ways you can sew a button, but I like to do it so the stitch looks like an X.

"Samantha was so excited to go to her new friend's seventh birthday party; it was going to be Spider-Man themed and Samantha loved spider-man! The party was going to start in 1 hour and it was time for her to get ready to go, so she ran as fast as she could into her room to grab her party clothes. When she reached into her drawer to grab her prettiest dress- It was a beautiful pink color with pretty purple flowers and polka dots on it- she found that the dress looked ruined! It was wrinkled and bunched up from being shoved into her drawer for so long underneath all her other clothes. She ran to her mom in a panic, saying she couldn't make it to the party with a ruined dress! Her mom smiled and told her it was going to be okay, then she pulled out something she called an Ironing Board, which she explained would help her get the wrinkles out of the pretty dress without hurting it. Her mom ironed the dress and sure enough, it was then free of wrinkles and she was ready to go to the birthday party!",38c808fc714a96279605867f4234b0ed,Why do they need a ironing board?,To put the dress on.,the dresses were wrinkled,gpt2,a89f8e180468d0e423c5912038d4bb24,Did they have to do all the ironing by themselves?,no,"no, she did them alone",gpt2,054066b11f3f6f78d4ef8cc0f7ad851c,What was hot?,The iron was hot,Spider-man costume,gpt2,bf7d81a07903962a8371f9087bc34e3a,Did they have to do all the ironing by themselves?,no,"No, they didn't.",gpt2,aca83b403521323deed651c7ef5d9b5d,Did they have help?,"Yes, her mom",Yes,gpt2,2221ffedebea10a7272102141af03887,Why do they need a ironing board?,To put the dress on.,it will help them get wrinkles out of the dress again,gpt2,7e37f5c83ddb9bda85e67403b37f3ec4,Did they have to do all the ironing by themselves?,no,yes,mhpg,9ca8e6fed5f0bd5e683951da6745f325,Why do they need a ironing board?,To put the dress on.,to hurting,mhpg,6fa780db6c6cc7ea564d3deaa02cb7d5,What was hot?,The iron was hot,The Ironing Board,gpt2,673a2ebb71ef27cfd4fbd8930be59a4e,Why do they need a ironing board?,To put the dress on.,it will take a few minutes to iron,gpt2,f007abe38a860c06c42ec6e530af78b5

Saturday night I went to AMC Cinema Theater with my friend Sally. It is the local movie theater in town that just opened up. Me and Sally walked in to the savory smell of popcorn being popped and the colorful lights all around the lobby of the theater. We gave out ticket stub to the worker and walked to the counter to buy some popcorn and and slushy for each of us. After we walked to the hallway where our movie was showing at. We sat in our seats and watched the movie. It was a hilarious comedy and it was really funny. After the movie was over we walked out the theater. As we walked to my car we were laughing on the way out talking about the parts of the movie that were the funniest.

"So I stand there on the side of the street, made an eye contact with the cab driver, and raised my hand and waved at him.

Taking a trip to celebrate a holiday is a wonderful experience.  I decided to take a trip to New York City this year to celebrate New Years Eve with friends.  My first question was if I should stay in a hotel or with friends.  Due to the cost of hotels I decided that staying with friends was the very best option.  I then decided that to travel to New York City my best choice would be to take the train.  The train trip from Boston to New York City is relatively short and it's very convenient because the train stop is very close to my friends apartment.  My friends and I then decided that we should make dinner reservations for a nice new years dinner in New York.

"Taking my child to bed at night is one of my most special parts of my day every single day. Our bedtime routine is generally the same every day. It begins with a bath. My child loves a bath and will absolutely not go to bed unless he can have his bath. He swims and plays in the bath tub long after he is squeaky clean. Next, he gets into pajamas and brushes his teeth. After that, he comes and holds my hand and tells me he is ready for his books. We both walk hand in hand to my bed, where he sleeps. He picks some books and climbs up into bed. We pull down the covers and both get cozy. I read him two, three or four books until he feels settled and tired enough. Then, I turn out the light and lay next to him as he says his prayers. He then tells me his favorite part of the day. I give him a kiss on the head, I blow a bunch of kisses from the doorway and say ""One Million Kisses in the Room"".

"Terri likes to vacuum the carpet, it is one of her chores she does every other day.  After school, she has a small list of little chores to do around the house.  She has to vacuum the living room and hallway for those days.  So, on one of these days, she takes out the vacuum cleaner, unwinds the cord, plugs it in, and adjusts the height of the vacuum.  This way, it is low to the ground, and gets all the dirt up.  She then hits the button for start, and it turns on.  She pushes it gently across the carpet and floors of the living room and hallway.

"The first step in taking the underground was determining where I  wanted to go. Then, I consulted Google maps on my phone. I opened the app and typed in my destination. I then selected the public transportation tab and pressed the navigate button. The app told me that I should take the red train to my destination. The station was just a couple of blocks away. I walked there and followed the instructions on the app as to which train to get (red train, northbound). I purchased a ticket at the ticket machine using my credit card. I scanned my ticket, then went through the turnstile. I followed the signs to the correct platform and waited a few minutes to for the train to arrive.

"The fishing day went really well and Allan was looking forward to his dinner of freshly-caught, fried fish.  He had filleted the fish as soon as he returned to the dock and now he rinsed and dried each fillet. He took some saltine crackers and crushed them in a plastic bag, using a rolling pin. He poured the crumbs onto a plate. He put some flour on another plate and added some salt and pepper and mixed them with the flour. Next, Allan cracked two eggs into a bowl and added a couple of spoonfuls of water. With a fork, he quickly stirred the egg and water until they were blended together. Allan put a large frying pan on his stove and turned on the burner. He added oil to about a half an inch. While the oil was heating, he took one fillet in his right hand and set it in the flour mixture and completely covered the fish. He then took the fillet and dipped it in the egg and then set the fish on the cracker crumbs. He turned the fish and pressed on the crumbs until the fillet was coated. He then carefully set the breaded fillet into the hot oil. When the edges of the fillet were starting to brown, he took tongs and carefully turned the fillet over. In just a few minutes, the bottom edges were also browning so he removed the fish from the pan with the tongs. He set the fish on some paper towels to soak up the excess oil and then moved it to his dinner plate.",2523d9f71f1d7816f1623b87fbcc6cdc,Were they an experienced cook?,yes,no,gpt2,cb813d8f69d3d87ea352eae0a9c8f3ed,Who is cooking the fish?,Allan,them,gpt2,df4d32c5566bd926619a230217e4fc6a,Who are they cooking the fish for?,himself,The fishermen.,gpt2,d7a382a94bdef8f57baae04e830112cb,When did they start cooking the fish?,After they got back from fishing,On the dinner plate,gpt2,68f47907f340f759abc9ab6a9b15a6c1,Who is cooking the fish?,Allan,The narrator of the story,gpt2,6dd99d584c24999e40d8f0c95e483035,Who is cooking the fish?,Allan,The narrator,gpt2,bd0bf3779bd843f464ff03b750f331b0,Were they an experienced cook?,yes,yes now,gpt2,1ceaa062926b43a9eba84c4ba8409b09,When did they start cooking the fish?,After they got back from fishing,Dinner,gpt2,e7c068fda1a80f6874bebe0350e9d218,When did they start cooking the fish?,After they got back from fishing,After they had finished cooking the fish.,gpt2,90c3d923dadecd93136db179ee44625b,Who are they cooking the fish for?,himself,It's been fish.,gpt2,e0c17fd71bba507a7f89c740adb1e7a0

"The grass on our front lawn was beginning to get tall and thick, so before it grew any higher, I thought it would be a good idea to cut it.  I decided to pull out our lawnmower from the shed in our backyard.  There are several kinds of lawnmowers, but the kind of lawnmower we own in gas-powered.  Because our lawnmower had no gas in it, I pulled a gas storage container off of a high shelf in our backyard shed and filled the gas tank.  To start the lawnmower, I pulled the starting cable vigorously a few times.  The lawnmower's motor roared to loud life and I began pushing it through the grass in the yard in a methodical back-and-forth pattern so the grass would be evenly and neatly cut.

"The kitchen floor was filthy after our big cookie baking marathon, so it was time to clean it.  After all the cookie baking mess was cleaned up, I took the vacuum cleaner, plugged it in to an outlet and vacuumed the floor being careful to get under the edges of where the counter stuck out.  I made sure I sucked up all the crumbs and other dirt before I unplugged the vacuum and put it away.  Next, I found the mop and mop bucket and carried them to the kitchen sink.  I let the water run until it was nice and hot, measured half a cup Lysol floor cleaner into the bucket, then filled it half way with hot water.  I placed the bucket on the floor, dipped the mop in to get it soaking wet, lifted it out of the water and kept it over the bucket, pulled down on the handle to wring out the extra water.  I started mopping the floor, rinsing the mop in the bucket every few minutes until I had reached the doorway.  I rinsed the mop once more, wrung it out and stood it on the kitchen floor propped up against the wall while I took the bucket out to our gravel driveway to empty it.

First , I turned the bike over and removed the front tire and tube . Next I filled the tube with air to check where the tube was damaged , and found a small glass shard which had punctured through it . After making ensure the tube was fully deflated , I repaired the puncture in the tube by using glue and applying a patch on top , then slid it back onto the tire using my hands . Next , I placed and pushed the tire back onto the tube . After which , I reconnected the tire onto the bicycle .

"The previous night and this morning before work I noticed I was missing a lot of necessary ingredients for my future meals . I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work . After I finished working I drove over to the store . It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot . Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . First , I picked up my deli . They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home .",b350e8052b0b14b5d756a866e5b99495,What did they do when they had their groceries?,Packed them into their car and drove home,"They headed to the cash/credit card store, got their food, and drove away.",gpt2,529949d8772d954ac91c841dfa5b6b76,Did they get meat?,Yes,no,gpt2,0fa71a9d05ce3d1cd5c0b1bea04c34f5,What did they do when they had their groceries?,Packed them into their car and drove home,Just drove off to work to buy,gpt2,06b99037efaa6169e31198222d6bae2c,When did they arrive?,After work.,The business day after work.,gpt2,767b3149b1b5c0545ed35820cd03c978,How did they pay for their groceries?,They used a debit card.,in their own vehicle,gpt2,f51607a12e869e5b627418b89fcdca94,Did they get meat?,Yes,yes they did,gpt2,bb6126e4c06ef9770b5bfe7d38480867,Did they get meat?,Yes,"Yes, they ate their own local meat just as they planned on",gpt2,38cbc6e674743be7fd74f8f6565743cc,When did they arrive?,After work.,The morning,gpt2,dfca4b0dffe102e0fe61cb9e071c62ff,Did they have to ask for help?,No,"No,they did not have a list on hand",gpt2,e7dc435ebe9add7cbefc89f3df525bee,How did they pay for their groceries?,They used a debit card.,They paid with their debit card,gpt2,c4b59f9f8e3835133bd74ec9380e5dfb

I looked through many postings but still did not find one I liked.  So I went to a different site and did the same thing.  I finally found a dress that I liked. So, I signed in and payed for the dress. It said it would arrive at my home in a couple of days.  Next, I needed to find some shoes.  So I searched up ""silver shoes"" and found one that I loved.

"This morning I decided to clean our bathroom shower in our house.  I knew it should only take about fifteen minutes so I got started right away.  I gathered together a cleaning sponge, a shower cleaning spray, a rinse cup, and a towel to dry my hands.  First, I removed everything I could from the shower such as shampoo bottles, soap, and razors.  Next I sprayed the shower with a shower cleaner.  I allowed this to stay on the walls about five minutes.  Then I took a wet sponge and began rubbing the tub and shower walls with a circular motion.

"This past month, I ended up coming down with some sort of illness. At first, I wasn't sure what it was, and searching the symptoms online gave me too many results to pinpoint just one illness. To avoid stressing myself further, I decided to visit my doctor. I scheduled an appointment with her over the phone to see her as soon as possible. Thankfully she would be able to see the next day. I went to the clinic the next day and told the receptionist  about my appointment. After a few minutes of waiting, my doctor saw me in her office. After a few different tests, she was finally able to give me a proper diagnosis. She told me that I had come down with bronchitis, and gave me a prescription for some medicine. I took this prescription to the pharmacy next door, and after an hour was able to get my medicine.

"This past weekend, my family made so much food that there was still plenty of it going into the week. Knowing this, we chose not to make any new food, because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend. All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top. The stove is a gas stove, which produces a flame that, in my opinion, cooks food much better than an electric stove.

We had a really good time. We all sat around the bonfire and ate snacks while sharing stories of old times. We also talked about what the future could hold for all of us. We were starting on a new road soon, we were all getting a fresh start, and it was so very exciting. I couldn't wait to start college in the fall as I'm sure most of my friends felt the same way.

"Throughout the month, my wife and I get bills to pay for things that we buy or use.  A lot of the times, we get a bill to pay rent and to pay for the electricity and gas that we use to use power and keep our house warm.

I put some water into the iron that turns into steam. Steam helps to take wrinkles out of clothes. Once the ironing board is set up I turn on the iron and give it time to heat up, about 2 minutes. Once heated up I put the pants on the ironing board. I start with the top part of the pants first and move or turn the pants after I iron each side. The I iron the leg part of the pants. I line up the leg part of the pants on the ironing board the way I want so that the crease will be the same. Once done I put everything away.

"Today I wanted to read the newspaper, but I do not have a newspaper subscription.  I decided that the best way to get the newspaper would be to go to the library and read it there.  I got dressed, put on my bike helmet, and biked over to the local public library.  There, I went in and asked the library clerk where the daily newspapers were located.  She directed me to the third floor, where all of the periodicals and newspapers were kept.  I thanked her and went up the stairs to the third floor, seeing the newspapers held on large wooden sticks.  I found the newspaper I wanted, the New York Times, and took it over to a large empty reading table.  There, I scrolled through the pages that interested me, mainly the sports and politics sections, before returning the newspaper, exiting the library, and riding home on my bike.",8b905d4076c754a2f703530a57959fb6,What did they do with the newspaper after they read it?,Returned the paper.,They went to the ALFR.,gpt2,c2349fc8468171da487776529af9267e,Where was the newspaper located?,in periodicals on the 3rd floor,On a book shelf and in their neighborhood library.,gpt2,ca2228745738e52e8fba8a71ee6fee4a,What did they do after they got the paper?,Sat at the table and read it,wrote to the clerk,gpt2,c39ada77a23c0990588265e18f3c2f89,How long did they have to wait til they got the newspaper?,Did not need to wait,They had to wait from the first floor until they got to the top floor in order for the newspaper,gpt2,1cb82c9c315336671963a1da881643cd,What did they do after they got the paper?,Sat at the table and read it,went to the library to read it there,gpt2,3b8c6264b3bde95cc2cb8cc9eac132e7,What did they do with the newspaper after they read it?,Returned the paper.,went into the reading room,gpt2,8fa93b9cc7f682ca5e9001e0f3de763c,Did they read it?,Yes,"No, they did not.",gpt2,d743bdd858594c5e1efc5ade9a80d737,What did they do with the newspaper after they read it?,Returned the paper.,Screw it up,gpt2,3b79ad8832ecbb1ff2ae553123cffa66,Where was the newspaper located?,in periodicals on the 3rd floor,At the library.,gpt2,3a15ba0681d1cc544a9a7252a0a0471f,What did they do after they got the paper?,Sat at the table and read it,"yes , they riding home",mhpg,98b30c5fdd204d6a58b7ade438737386

"Today was a really hot day. It was 95 degrees. I decided to go to the swimming pool in my neighborhood and cool off. I put on my bathing suit, a cover up dress, a hat with a large brim, sunglasses, and flip flops. I packed a bag with sunscreen, a towel, and a cold bottle of water. Then I walked three blocks to the swimming pool. It was crowded, but I was able to find an available lounge chair on the side of the pool. I put my things down and took the sunscreen out of the bag. I prayed the sunscreen all over my body. Then I laid down on the chair to relax. After about twenty minutes, I was ready to go in the water and go swimming. I swam five laps and then I was ready to get out. I got out of the pool, toweled off, and laid down on the chair again.

"Today, I had to pack a suitcase. I put all of my favorite things into it, as I was going to be gone for a very, very long time. In fact, I'm not sure when I will return to the location that I am in right now. I first entered my toiletries, including my tooth brush, hair brush, and deodorants. I also threw some cologne in there. Then, I added my clothes, including pants, shirts, socks, underwear - boxers, not briefs.

"Upon deciding that a room in the house needs new wallpaper, the family takes a trip to the hardware store. Wallpaper is selected from the designs available.

Washing clothes is a frequent activity that used to be done by hand but now can be done using washing machines and dryers. Some people with lots of children wash clothes everyday. To wash clothes you need to gather all the dirty clothes and use a laundry machine. Some people have laundry machines at home and some people need to go to a wash house to use laundry machines. The wash houses have all different size machines and some take coins and other wash houses take cards. To wash the clothes you have to separate by color so that all the white clothes are together and all the colored clothing is together. Also if you have sheets and towels you want to wash those separately. When you find a machine that is the right size for the clothes you need to wash you add the clothes and then follow the directions to see how much laundry soap you add. Some people use liquid laundry soap and some people use powder laundry soap. You can even do a mixture or combination but make sure to use the right amount. After adding the clothes and the soap you pay for the machine and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the clothes to wash. After the clothes are washed you still need to put them in a dryer unless they are delicate clothes that are not supposed to go into the dryer because they might shrink. You take the clothes and put them in the dryer but make sure not to put anything that might shrink. For the delicate clothes you hang them to dry. After you put all your clothes into the dryers it is time to fold the laundry! This is important so the laundry will be nice and neat and not wrinkled.

I scrubbed my body well with a washcloth , to get off all the sand and ocean salt that had dried on my skin , along with the sunscreen that I had been using .

"We have a large yard, a half acre on a corner lot. Due to the size, we have a ride-on mower which makes cutting the grass relatively easy, I would even say ""fun."" Thanks to a lot of experience, I can get that thing moving and get the yard done in just a little under an hour. It's normal, average, boring. Except this one time.... A cousin had taken our ride-on mower to do some maintenance on it. He had taken it on a Friday evening and had promised it would be back by Sunday evening. He was wrong. Sunday and Monday came and went with no sign of our lawn mower. Tuesday evening came and the grass was up to your ankles. It needed to be cut. We had bought a small push mower to get into the small spaces so we pulled it out. Me, my wife and my mother-in-law took turns pushing that mower up and down the yard for a good two hours. We had one tiny little bit left of the yard when Howard, the cousin, pulled up with the push mower.",f70ac6fdc81650a756655cb65e6df863,Who mowed the grass?,"The speaker, his wife and mother-in-law",Both the local tavern and a BMW,gpt2,15291c773cb1161736ca39eafe47eff7,Who mowed the grass?,"The speaker, his wife and mother-in-law",The narrator,gpt2,693168568c1997b5f85bbef93578df9c,Did anyone help to mow the lawn?,Yes,yeah,backtranslation,530901aeba336c6ea0313e50ba8ee190,Did anyone help to mow the lawn?,Yes,No,gpt2,b18ac66faa59eb8bd0b25b1301df15b6,Was the grass very long before they mowed the lawn?,Yes,language,backtranslation,b6ba65527a41bd55d39ca6cf3b03c33a,Who mowed the grass?,"The speaker, his wife and mother-in-law","the speakable , his wife and son-in-law",backtranslation,03c4f7ab8f1bd2a10ee3a12b7656bafc,Why did they need to mow the lawn?,The grass was too high,The highway traffic jam took hold,gpt2,d92867fd347d2022fd0a38da3fe5aef3,Why did they need to mow the lawn?,The grass was too high,It was dirty,gpt2,6f24124e5655b76456dead76ec275ab0,Why did they need to mow the lawn?,The grass was too high,it was dirty and they had to cut grass,gpt2,f0fb2ecc91eb860313d23c0b2d7c6d32,Who mowed the grass?,"The speaker, his wife and mother-in-law",everyone.,gpt2,43e958ee66b3a13416d3e29548624c3d
"We look out the window and discover it is a bright sunny day, which is perfect for going to the beach. We load up the car with all sorts of beach things: buckets, shovels, beach chairs, towels, and an umbrella. We also pack a lunch in the cooler. Everyone in the family puts on their swimsuits and sunscreen. We drive to the beach, and we all unload the car and walk to the beach. We set up on the beach, with our chairs and the umbrella. Mom reads her book in the chair and hangs out with the baby, while Dad takes the older kids swimming. They are very careful to not go in the water too deep.

"We normally set a menu on Sunday for each day of the upcoming week to avoid chaos during dinner time. Before I leave for the day in the morning, I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal. At around five-thirty, I begin preparing the meal. One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and seasoned green beans. I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs, ketchup, and a bit of egg to bind it. I also lightly season it for flavor. I push it into the loaf pan, and put it in the oven to cook. I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans. I like to use fresh green beans. They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking them, but they taste so much fresher. I season them with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice.

"We were excited about the awesome new mall and planned all week to visit it this past weekend! I called my sisters and friends and we all decided to meet in the front at noon on Saturday. There was plenty of parking and nice security cameras to keep us safe. We walked in the first large store and everyone decided to split up and meet at the food court two hours later.

"When I got up this morning I was very tired. I decided that I needed something to help wake me up before I started my various activities for the day. I went to the kitchen and took my electric water kettle to the sink and filled it up with enough water to make a couple of large cups of tea.

We got on our first train and everything went smoothly. However, after we got on our second train, we quickly realized we were headed in the wrong direction! We got off  at the next stop and switched to the other side of the subway station so we could get to our hotel.

"When I was a boy scout, we went fishing to a lake.  When we were on the lake (it was frozen), we decided to fish for some fish.  We drilled a hole into the lake and caught a lot.  We wanted to cook them, so we cleaned them out of all the nasty stuff in their body and started a fire.  When the fire was getting calmed down, the hot coals started to steam.  When it started steaming, we got the fish out and put it on a cast iron pan.  We put the pan on the middle of the fire with the lid on it and we waited while the fish cooked.  It smelled really good to us, especially with how hungry that we were.  After it started to smell almost burned, we took the pan off of the fire with hot gloves and ate the fish inside when cooled.",89e3b67db4f33841605ba5b2581f9ab0,Who was eating the fish?,The narrator and his boy scout troop,Skittles,gpt2,eb5a7205d3d11ce3ba35e22d9084f76d,Who was eating the fish?,The narrator and his boy scout troop,The narrator,gpt2,ef987e896f06e613543c7f2252e45ab6,Who was waiting to eat the fish?,The scouts.,The narrator,gpt2,c55204a0b024196f656c2b330107d226,Was the fish cooked over a fire?,yes,NO,gpt2,547614bf088feb667975633a332c60a9,Who was waiting to eat the fish?,The scouts.,The narrator and the narrator alone.,gpt2,d7093d347245bbc36f051f7d793d45eb,Who was waiting to eat the fish?,The scouts.,The narrator and the narrator's friends,gpt2,5a2fd90dc81ca916338b5941ce9dbf74,Who was eating the fish?,The narrator and his boy scout troop,story teller,gpt2,688d8b0301561ed9fb2a447d5357a836,Where did the fish come from?,they caught it in a lake,"Lake, Alaska",gpt2,7c4ab031137481b5c6cf7b1345309a61,Where did the fish come from?,they caught it in a lake,Frozen lake in the mountains.,gpt2,93751ab8d00806e7a141c4cec129b1b5,Where did the fish come from?,they caught it in a lake,Lake lake,gpt2,a712cd6b19ba697ed47f14dbe52fdaad

"When I was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday . Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard . I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . It was a small tree so this was not a big hole . I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . The tree grew and became quite large . The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit .",a5172a8e6ed3ab8f8f3b10e0fc1fad78,Where is the tree located?,In their front yard,In front of the house,gpt2,4b6606a651dba125f661258b23cd6734,What tools did they use to plant the tree?,shovel,Shovels,gpt2,0838dff34fceed90ae401738047dc16d,What tools did they use to plant the tree?,shovel,a bong,gpt2,14eb6d1ed632d4dfd488e6d854706818,Where was the tree planted?,In their front yard,Back yard.,gpt2,6491125ff0f53094a0469f02db4e461c,How much work was required to plant the tree?,a lot of work,a few minutes,mhpg,87f183e78d951abae045526bdd7befb3,What tools did they use to plant the tree?,shovel,a shovel and soil,gpt2,1099484b1fd80a4bd19391f3c1ce8962,Where is the tree located?,In their front yard,In the town center where the Christmas tree was planted,gpt2,fb183b22216e9d60d8712591d1cc9bb7,Where is the tree located?,In their front yard,The home of 6th grade.,gpt2,28987d2cc4532767917b972b5ee9a9d7,How much work was required to plant the tree?,a lot of work,$10,gpt2,ce0694054781acd521fb83bdcb48aca7,How much work was required to plant the tree?,a lot of work,A lot,gpt2,15e4a921f6ee0e47acb87e4bd941d19d
"When I was a teenager, I asked a girl if she would like to go bowling with me at a bowling alley.  She said that she would come and asked me what to bring.  I told her she didn't need to bring anything but herself.  I picked her up the next day and we drove to the bowling alley.  We got out of the car and went into the bowling alley.  We bought a couple of games to play and had to rent shoes so that we wouldn't slip on the slippery floor.  We got a couple of decent weighted balls to throw down the alley.  We took turns throwing the ball down the hall and trying to hit the pins on the other side.  She was a lot better than me and scored more points.

"When I was hungry last week for a little snack and a soda, I went to the closest vending machine. I felt that it was a little overpriced, but being as though I needed something, I used the vending machine. First, I put money into the snack machine and entered the code for the bag of chips that I wanted. Soon after, the snack came out. Then, I went over to the drink dispenser and got a soda.

"When I was young, my mom had an obsession with painting the walls of our house. As soon as she finished painting one room, she would start on another. We were in this never ending flux of wall colors. Her most ambitious project was painting her bedroom in an unconventional way.

The problem was, her bedroom was huge, so this took months and enlisted the help of me and my siblings.

"When it was time to clean the floor, the first thing I needed to do was sweep the debris and garbage. I use the broom to sweep the floor from one end to the next, piling all of the dust, dirt and other debris on the floor into a pile in the center of the room. I used a dustpan to collect all the debris, placing it on the floor and using the broom to sweep all of the brie onto the surface of the dustpan. I empty the contents of the dustpan into the garbage then placed the broom and dust pan into the corner. I then made a bucket of water that had floor cleaning solution diluted into it in order to make sites. I took my mop from the corner of the room where the room was, and placed the head of the mob into the water, soaking the head of the mop. Once the head of the mop was completely submerged underwater, and soaking wet, I removed the mop from the bucket and squeeze out the excess water. I then use the mop to wipe over the entire floor. I ensure that all of the stains and stuck on dirt that was on the floor have been removed with the mop, and that the floor looks spotless including when I finished. I rinsed off the mop with clean water, to remove the left over grime and dirt, and placed the mop in the corner.

"When my baby was born, I knew I would be learning a lot of new things. She woke up in the middle of the night because she was hungry. I picked her up from her crib and held her close as I walked towards the rocking chair in the nursery. I pulled down the shoulder of my nightgown and unhooked the nursing bra I was wearing so the baby could latch onto my breast and eat.

I picked her up one of those Saturdays and took her to the club.  There was a fee we had to pay to dance of about 10 dollars.  After we got in, the music started to get really loud and we got really excited.  We jumped out into the dance floor and started to dance with each other.  We would stomp our feet and clap our hands.  We would twirl around and jump around.  It was a lot of fun for us and we got really thirsty.

"When sending party invitations, I think it is important to first pick an invitation that reflects the theme of the party. For instance, if the theme of the party is a Hawaiian luau, then I would pick an invite with palm trees and tropical flowers. I think it is a wise decision to write out a list of people whom I  want to invite beforehand so that I do not leave anyone out. On the invite, I include information such as when and where the party is. I also include what type of attire people should wear so that people are dressed appropriately for the party. These day, it is much easier to send party invitations through electronic means on the computer such social media or email. It also saves money on stamps, and I do not have to write out the addresses on the envelopes by hand. After sending out the invitations, I sit back and wait for people to r.s.v.p. to tell me whether or not they will be able to attend my party.",e133b551409cec76160cb610717d5691,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,To invite friends and family to the party,gpt2,f80b2ba31ab534ec3704f937c889aa0c,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,yes,mhpg,87a7ae871e07a0ff2dc64421c6e67d92,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,inviting people to a party,backtranslation,3aa7ce0db62296933c30d75face996d1,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,One person.,gpt2,39b98ce7a85c990093b5d41153333174,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,yes,mhpg,2ec83078e703d128b00793a441eeb9b1,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,invitations were mailed early,gpt2,42b7ae2b32e2c46c27d4ac308bfafb57,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,They were going to a Hawaiian oasis to enjoy Hawaiian food,gpt2,018aa7ff3208cf6d49ac4238a292d362,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,To invite people to attend.,gpt2,69d9be971bdd75ae2836d652675f90c4,Why were invitations sent out?,to invite people to the party,invite people to a party,backtranslation,c36f876d3a2351c7cedf6e9c39975ab5,Why were the party invitations sent out?,to invite people to a party,they are new,gpt2,ea5de41ca373ddf48376b44a4c2fe2c3

"When you work in a restaurant, after the customers have paid the bill and left, you have to clean up the table and prepare it for the next customer.  Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person, but if it was a large family it could be very messy.  All the left over plates, cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed.  The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills, so it is fresh and clean for the next diners.   And if there are placemats they too will need replacing.  My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in, especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use.  Once the new place mats are down, a whole new table setting can be done.  Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table.  It may involve fancy folded napkins, or how the glasses or utensils get lined up. Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates, utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers.  But regardless of what the restaurants table set up may look like, the table has to be ready so new customers can come in and enjoy their meal.",c4f39c5c1e9347847c4606fb48dc4305,When was the last time they were cleaned?,after the last diner was finished,after the customers,mhpg,dde155ce01faec4ee1c440e43904ff2a,Who are they cleaning the table for?,So it's clean for the next diner,yes,mhpg,1acee101cc0e1593425a8e460d123494,Where did they clean the table?,At the restaurant,At the kitchen,gpt2,6893600f537a317b5c95ba129c447051,Why did they clean the table?,It was dirty,Customer service call/sales,gpt2,63eb0da68fe59d1f10f7295a7f46e81b,Who are they cleaning the table for?,So it's clean for the next diner,the restaurant guests,gpt2,3b2d53a624e9b0c8033f454c122edb06,Where did they clean the table?,At the restaurant,The middle,gpt2,afac8be6382e60be5a5ce98e9e9785be,Why did they clean the table?,It was dirty,to get grease and water out,gpt2,7acdfb45dbaec196972f3d30ccf99a73,Where did they clean the table?,At the restaurant,in the kitchen,mhpg,c65cc7ff499933394b481806c8dccfeb,When was the last time they were cleaned?,after the last diner was finished,After the customers paid the bill,gpt2,d0af3101dd72c1421f3996961e00d977,Did they have to clear the table before cleaning it?,"Yes, they clear it.",Yes they cleaned up the table.,gpt2,19d8ae83874b47e859578dc1fb3de609

My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in, especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use.  Once the new place mats are down, a whole new table setting can be done.  Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table.  It may involve fancy folded napkins, or how the glasses or utensils get lined up. Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates, utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers.  But regardless of what the restaurants table set up may look like, the table has to be ready so new customers can come in and enjoy their meal.",204c40f3564c0df234c57833ce31ffd8,Did anyone help them clean the table?,No one helped,"No, they paid for an attendant",gpt2,9fe28923331be44ad40349daf17a922b,Did they have to clear the table before cleaning it?,"Yes, they clear it.","no, done before",gpt2,fe0dec28042fa3a8f03a409cc5a7299d,Did they have to clear the table before cleaning it?,"Yes, they clear it.","yes , they paid in the restaurant",mhpg,2e4d91446f1620cf1d052ca3ae49d7eb,Who are they cleaning the table for?,So it's clean for the next diner,The Restaurant Manager,gpt2,a0c1fae9d8f61fc709eb8961d31b9887,Why did they clean the table?,It was dirty,customers are coming in,gpt2,4969e416037ff0b26c5656b8c1338e62,Who are they cleaning the table for?,So it's clean for the next diner,The wait staff,gpt2,02d141169c42e73cbfcfc2362aee4562,When was the last time they were cleaned?,after the last diner was finished,In the last week.,gpt2,2ec8a290cb2cee75ecb14483203f1ea8,When was the last time they were cleaned?,after the last diner was finished,When they left,gpt2,42be44f3a0cab9d75cfbe8e646924f23,Did they have to clear the table before cleaning it?,"Yes, they clear it.",Yes,gpt2,ece82c0ce413767e62ce5b117010e6ef,Did anyone help them clean the table?,No one helped,no they were alone in the story,gpt2,77852bd5182c0f4051c912173bc5506f
While casually browsing through my friends pictures online I discovered a new revelation . They are called Lush bath bombs and the are colorful scented fizz balls . I quickly ordered a few online from their website and when they came I was overcome with excitement . I brought a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one . I put the Hello Kitty tub stopper in my bath tub and ran my bathwater until the tub was halfway full . Then I dropped the bath bomb in the water and was anointed by the wonderful smell of lavender . The water in the tub fizzled with pretty blue glitter . I got in an soaked for more than an hour and got out feeling like a million bucks . I seemed to be a thousand times cleaner than I was before I got it .

He laced up his shoes and was ready to go. he saw an open court and he took it. he pressed the new game button and off he went. he saw that the pins were set up in a very specific way but he was ready for that challenge. he rolled the ball so far onto the lane that it knocked out all of the bowling pins and he received a strike! everyone was so amazed.

"Yes going on a train , this is was our ideal weekend activity not too long ago . We purchased tickets to travel from Boston to New York City . As we entered the platform of the train is was pure steel and looked so solidly strong . We walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there . Shortly the train horn blasted making me jump of my seat lol . Anyway we soon started moving and our train ride was underway . The conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets . love scenery so I had the window seat watching everything along the way .

Yesterday I made a flight reservation to fly from Boston to Chicago.  The first step in making a flight reservation is to determine which airline you would like to fly.  I picked American Airlines because I have most of my airline miles with them and I always like to earn more miles.  I accessed the American Airlines website and entered the desired dates of my flight.  The website then provided me a bunch of different flight options for both my departing and returning flights.  I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable and I selected them.  I was then directed to pay for my flight which I did via my American Airlines credit card.  Once my flight was paid for I received an email confirming my transaction and providing me my flight details.

"Yesterday I went bowling with my friends.  They told me that they would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm.  At 2pm I started getting ready.  By 2:30pm I was ready.  I made sure to bring socks with me, since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley.  I grabbed my car keys and got in my car.  I drove to the bowling alley.  I listened to a little bit of music on my way.  Once I got to the bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside.  Once I was inside, I walked over to my friends.  I asked them how many games they wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games.  I walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.  The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50.  I wanted two play two games with my friends so I paid $7.00.  Next, I needed to buy shoes so that I could bowl.  I needed special shoes to go bowling so that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl.  I asked the cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a pair.  Now I needed a bowling ball.  But I didn't want a bowling ball that would be too heavy.  So I chose one that was only five pounds.  All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling.  We all put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game.  I was first.  Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes, and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting.  Then I took my bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back then I let go of the bowl.  The bowling ball flew down the lane.  Out of the ten pins I knocked down six.  Since I didn't knock down all of the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's turn to bowl.  I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.

"Yesterday I went bowling with my friends.  They told me that they would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm.  At 2pm I started getting ready.  By 2:30pm I was ready.  I made sure to bring socks with me, since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley.  I grabbed my car keys and got in my car.  I drove to the bowling alley.  I listened to a little bit of music on my way.  Once I got to the bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside.  Once I was inside, I walked over to my friends.  I asked them how many games they wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games.  I walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.  The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50.  I wanted two play two games with my friends so I paid $7.00.  Next, I needed to buy shoes so that I could bowl.  I needed special shoes to go bowling so that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl.  I asked the cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a pair.  Now I needed a bowling ball.  But I didn't want a bowling ball that would be too heavy.  So I chose one that was only five pounds.  All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling.  We all put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game.  I was first.  Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes, and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting.  Then I took my bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back then I let go of the bowl.  The bowling ball flew down the lane.  Out of the ten pins I knocked down six.  Since I didn't knock down all of the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's turn to bowl.  I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.  Since I knocked down all of the pins I got a spare! By the end of the game I had won the most points out of all of my friends! I won!

"Yesterday I went grocery shopping . I left my house and drove to the store . I parked the car , walked inside and grabbed a shopping cart . I looked at my list and saw that I needed some fresh produce . I picked out the best looking strawberries , they were on sale for $ 2 a pound . I bought several pounds because my daughter loves fresh strawberries . I finished up in the produce section , buying some things to make a green salad later to go with dinner . I then stopped at the meat section and picked out some nice cuts of steak for dinner . I went into the frozen foods section and found ice cream was also on sale . I bought vanilla and chocolate . I went through the rest of the aisles , consulting my list and picking out what my family needed .

"Yesterday I woke up and decided to wear my favorite cardigan sweater to work.  After taking a shower and eaten breakfast I started getting dressed.

"Yesterday afternoon, my sister and I went to the outdoor neighborhood swimming pool. The pool requires that visitors either live in the neighborhood or be guests of a neighborhood resident in order to enter, and because we met those criteria, we had no problems getting in. The day was sunny and above eighty degrees. I wore my teal one-piece swimsuit and my sister wore her pink bikini. After we had walked to the pool from our house, we both lathered up with sunscreen and laid our towels and pool bags on vacant lounge chairs. There were only a dozen people at the pool. One of them was my sister's friend, so she left immediately to go splash around with her and hang out on a raft. I ordered a raspberry smoothie and laid out with my copy of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" while the sun heated my skin.

"Yesterday evening, my friend Jasmine called me on my cell phone. We talked about so many things and we were on the phone for about 2 hours. She asked me how life was ever since I moved from Denver to Atlanta. I told her that life had been amazing and the only thing that sucks, is the horrible traffic. Jasmine also mentioned that she will be visiting me next month for a week long vacation. I was so excited to hear that I will have a visitor because sometimes it can get lonely not having family in the same city as you.

"Yesterday my car broke down , so I was thinking of how I would get to work . I decided one of the best options would be to take a public bus . Since I 've never taken one before , I went to the city website and looked at a schedule of all the bus times and routes . When I had finally decided on the bus that I needed to take , it was time to put my plan into action . I left my house and walked over to the bus stop .

Yesterday my wife and I wanted to watch a new movie that had just hit the video stands.  I went to the local store which had a Red Box video vending machine outside of it.  I looked over the selections it had till I found the one I wanted.  I put my credit card into the slot for paying and purchased a copy of the movie to watch.  I took the copy from the machine and headed home after stopping at the store to buy some popcorn for the movie.  I placed it into the DVD and watched the movie while enjoying the popcorn.  The movie and the popcorn were great.  When I was done I popped the DVD out of the machine and went back to the store to return the movie to the Red Box video vending machine.  It was an excellent experience and I will definitely do it again.,ea104da7652f5450322457fdf632ee62,Did they return the movie on time?,Yes,"Yes,they returned it to the Red Box just as it sat",gpt2,2c2c5e7fe527c485ef7c74777c468185,Did they return the movie on time?,Yes,Yes they did,gpt2,a3f414dfa94ff04ae2e436492bb9a84f,Where was the movie rented?,RedBox machine,at the kitchen,mhpg,87b159d4061ccf20a23710dff4b08a8e,is it DVD or VHS?,the husband rented a DVD from Redbox,DVD and VHS,gpt2,4f0001ed060a1de96bb6da57fd5b4faf,When did they rent the movie?,yesterday,when the DVD was ready to be seen,gpt2,af091ec326b1ff7d46cb8abb863236ca,Did they return the movie on time?,Yes,no,gpt2,dfdc88db484b5af587f037a5d6925f8e,is it DVD or VHS?,the husband rented a DVD from Redbox,DVD format,gpt2,5624419662be60b6228c26897e677606,Where was the movie rented?,RedBox machine,At the store,gpt2,01b391985a149905ff531bf2cba55879,is it DVD or VHS?,the husband rented a DVD from Redbox,DVD,gpt2,5613a8f4161f08671ee9ab8ce4760206,Where was the movie rented?,RedBox machine,At the Red Box store in downtown Chicago,gpt2,5040a33445d55ad84c7c2fcc17235db9

I fried the eggs, cooked the bacon, fried the hash browns, and cooked the toast. After my spouse and I ate, I had a few more dishes to do.

"Yesterday your father and I decided to go play a few rounds of tennis.  Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with two people, sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs.  There is a low net between both people playing the game.  We use tennis rackets and tennis balls to hit the ball back and forth to each other.  Sometimes one person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball so that person scores.  The person with the highest score without any fouls or out of bounds wins the set.  We played for a few hours before both of us became extremely tired, then we came home.

I then stuffed each check into a separate envelope, wrote the addresses of the companies onto their respective envelopes, and dropped off the envelopes into the mail pickup box.",1844179bbd6bb6b8b3c44037ff115c86,When were the bills due?,In the month of May,yes,mhpg,c2dfb0b8c17582fb4e203aa79db02a8d,Where do they send the bills?,To the three companies,To the mail pickup box,gpt2,dc01282fc49dbc2df411120d88277205,Did they go to the bank to cash any money?,No,"No, they went to the bank to pay.",gpt2,54d4a5a7e5cd675734647fb393a45f5b,What were the bills for?,utilities,the heating and water,gpt2,4ff5d64667b9a0474ba2f68cf52c8845,How did they pay there bills?,by check,By mail,gpt2,0173dd43bffd9a8adbbb4aed1bf9e32b,When were the bills due?,In the month of May,after the payment deadline,gpt2,45b463ec5f332e3893715161a110a8d2,What were the bills for?,utilities,"Electricity, gas and heating",gpt2,66a3075e94e0a9e7a157bc5ccc3af093,Where do they send the bills?,To the three companies,in the mail,gpt2,7ba680eefc8e3319150016026f674881,How did they pay there bills?,by check,by credit cards,gpt2,3a7f4159b032a5c5072f47d487094027,Do they seem upset about paying their bills?,no,"No, they are happy with the payment.",gpt2,9f30c21ddd39ed67105a77bbb4bb41df
"Yesterday, I went on a date with my husband. We decided to go on a picnic in the park. Before the date, I got out our picnic basket so I could fill it with some good food. In the picnic basket, I put in some leftover cold fried chicken. I also put in a potato salad, some grapes and strawberries. For drinks, I put in some sparkling water. Then I add made sure to include napkins, utensils, and a picnic blanket. The park is close by to our home, so we decided to walk there. It took less than 5 minutes to arrive. When we got there, my husband laid out the picnic blanket on the soft grass. We sat down, and I emptied the basket. We had a good time. We were talking and laughing while eating our food. We some birds and gave them some of the breading off the fried chicken. The birds loved it. It was fun, and we really enjoyed each other's company. It was a good break for us from everyday life.

"Yesterday, I went to a doctor appointment. My doctor's name is Dr. Jane who asks her patients to call her by her first name. My appointment was set for two weeks ahead of time for a follow up. I got to the office ten minutes early in case I had to fill out any paperwork. I entered the lobby and approached the front desk. The desk nurse greeted me and had me sign in with my name and doctor I was there to see. She told me I could sit down to wait so I found a chair near the front to sit. I didn't have to wait long and was called to the back by the head nurse. The nurse first took my weight, then my temperature and blood pressure readings. She said everything was fine. Next, she had me follow her to the room where the doctor would see me. Once there she had me sit on the bed and asked me how I was and if I had any symptoms. After taking a blood sample she left the room. I waited for 10 minutes and Dr. Jane came in. After a short discussion, she said the antibiotics had done their job and that my vertigo was all cleared up. After thanking the doctor I paid my fee and was even given a sucker with my receipt which made me smile. Finally, I left the office.
