", 6% of the population was reported to live below the poverty line, when adjusted for taxes and transfers. Denmark has the 2nd lowest relative poverty rate in the OECD, below the 11.3% OECD average. The share of the population reporting that they feel that they cannot afford to buy sufficient food in Denmark is less than half of the OECD average. With an employment rate of 72.8%, Denmark ranks 7th highest among the OECD countries, and above the OECD average of 66.2%. The number of unemployed people is forecast to be 65,000 in 2015. The number of people in the Legal working age group, less disability pensioners etc., will grow by 10,000 to 2,860,000, and jobs by 70,000 to 2,790,000; part-time jobs are included. Because of the present high demand and short supply of skilled labour, for instance for factory and service jobs, including hospital nurses and physicians, the annual average working time have risen, especially compared with the recession 1987-1993.

"2. The relative quiet of the Tatar attacks on Russia in the late 30s and early 40s of the 17th century is undoubtedly due to the occupation of Azov by the Don Cossacks. The Russian government did not want to start a war with Turkey, did not send troops and after a long occupation the Cossacks left the town in 1642. The builders of the Belgorod Line and residents of the southern Russian districts, by the increase of Tatar attacks, immediately felt the change in the situation on the lower reaches of the Don. 3. In summer of 1633, 2000 Budjak Tatars invaded the southern Polish land and began to ravage Podolia. Crown Field Hetman Stanislaw Koniecpolski camping with the Polish army at Bar, led the 2000 cavalry against the Tatars and forced them to retreat. He then crossed the Dniester and on 4 July at the Battle of Sasov Rog on the River Prut defeated enemy. Poles captured several Budjak mirzas, among whom was the son-in-law of Cantemir Mirza, freed all the captives and captured a large part of the loot. In August Silistrian Pasha, Abaza Pasha, led the Turkish troops came to the Polish border and encamped near Khotin . Koniecpolski with a Polish army  went out to meet the enemy and established fortified camp near the fortress Kamenetz-Podolsky. Initially Abaza Pasha entered into peace negotiations with Koniecpolski. On 19 September the Budjak Horde  under Kantemir Mirza arrived to help Abaza-Pasha. On 20 September Abaza-Pasha crossed the Dniester and Kantemir Mirza attacked the Polish position. On 23 September Abaza Pasha, confident of his numerical superiority, attacked the Polish camp near Kamenets, but was defeated and forced to retreat to Moldavia.",f3b4e9a1b69c70af503beaf5fa2f79c5,Abaza Pasha retreated from where?,near Kamenets,Koniecpolski,naqanet,132996c7f775e19dd53209e1141a2b9d,Abaza Pasha retreated from where?,near Kamenets,moldavia,nabert,2fe8c98a13b7520c1538e926df667371,How many after Kantemir Mirza attacked Poland in September did he retreat to Moldavia?,3,1,naqanet,82a1c6b5e39fff052905eb73e6795e5d,How many days after Abaza-Pasha crossed the Dniester and Kantemir Mirza  attacked the Polish position did he attack the Polish camp near Kamenets?,3,-3,naqanet,2899ff6622f49fc611b880819702feb0,How many times did Budjak Tatars invade the Southern Polish land?,1,2,naqanet,d2ca1acb4de0aaa1a281fd8705d36b13,What year did the Budjak Horde arrive to help Abaza-Pasha?,1633,0,naqanet,34e200e86555307aeab29beca91019e8,What year did the Budjak Horde arrive to help Abaza-Pasha?,1633,1996.0,nabert,6780e75d8be3ff3a6b9c2d6b01b12bf2,What year was Battle of Sasov Rog?,1633,0,naqanet,9933c182208f62211c7a2dc2098737d5,Who were the enemies of the Budjak Tatars?,Poles,2000 cavalry,nabert,e80cc348c9ef88bf46a96f556ebb5921,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"A 2013 analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that from 1971 to 2008, the size of the black-white IQ gap in the United States decreased from 16.33 to 9.94 IQ points. It has also concluded however that, while IQ means are continuing to rise in all ethnic groups, this growth is occurring more slowly among 17-year-old students than among younger students and the black-white IQ gap is no longer narrowing. As of 2008, a study published in 2013 by Heiner Rindermann, Stefan Pinchelmann, and James Thompson have estimated the IQ means of 17-year-old black, white, and Hispanic students to range respectively from 90.45-94.15, 102.29-104.57 and 92.30-95.90 points. They explain that the gap may persist due to the crack epidemic, the degradation of African-American family structure, the rise of fraud in the educational system (especially with respect to No Child Left Behind), the decrease in unskilled real wages and employment among African-Americans due to globalization and minimum wage increases, differences in parental practices (such as breastfeeding or reading to children), and ""environmental conditions shaped by [African-Americans] themselves."" To resolve this, they ultimately recommend the reestablishment of ""meritoric principles"" and ""blindly graded objective central exams,"" as opposed to ""affirmative action,"" in education.",601df5be575b42ee728efa4737d7c0da,How many IQ points did the black-white IQ gap decrease between 1971 and 2008?,6.39,-6.389999999999999,nabert,cf511260241696782451900e61348176,How many IQ points did the black-white IQ gap decrease between 1971 and 2008?,6.39,2,naqanet,576c4f31fabf85879525892fb53a2318,How many IQ points did the black-white IQ gap decrease in the United States in a 2013 analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress?,6.39,2,naqanet,df6015bc20e3710cd5cf7fed8aae24eb,How many IQ points did the black-white IQ gap decrease in the United States in a 2013 analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress?,6.39,6.389999999999999,nabert,bbe77f544415c28f4ac2660c3d053cce,How many people authored the study released in 2013?,3,2,naqanet,e538fcb508354186a059cfbb15479827,"How many people worked on and published a study that estimated the IQ means of 17-year-old black, white, and Hispanic students?",3,17,naqanet,7792b55830f882522de1acc427bea2f8,How many points did the black-white IQ gap decrease by from 1971 to 2008?,6.39,-6.389999999999999,nabert,2ed5e7ea81fafdfff22d9b9da8d25313,How many points did the black-white IQ gap decrease by from 1971 to 2008?,6.39,17,naqanet,b847e816341f4ab28fed824b1b2daf18,How many points did the black-white IQ gap decrease from 1971-2008?,6.39,-6.389999999999999,nabert,35470fd0b3d9899ddc9570a92b3735f4,How many points did the black-white IQ gap decrease from 1971-2008?,6.39,17,naqanet,91953a24fd2afbda4c1c66df236d2036,How many points difference is the IQ range in 17-year-old black students?,3.7,0,naqanet,04ce2959a44572b8f9c9d657fc1b91a7,How many points difference is the IQ range in 17-year-old black students?,3.7,0.6700000000000017,nabert,4ac553536c5ab8619e0bb7f225aff7a7,How many reasons are cited as causing the persistent gap between white and black IQs?,6,2,naqanet,8bcc4f5c5044ee484147ca5668aca752,How many reasons are cited as causing the persistent gap between white and black IQs?,6,5,nabert,5e3e068feeb926586000b25101d2bfc7,"In a study published in 2013, who was estimated to have the higher IQ means between 17-year-old black, white or Hispanic students?",white,Hispanic students,naqanet,97ccbf22e27a74287fdf3f8c7e01b59d,"In a study published in 2013, who was estimated to have the higher IQ means between 17-year-old black, white or Hispanic students?",white,heiner rindermann,nabert,a7af387dcaf66849a8202e320d77544b,"Which race had a higher IQ according to a study published in 2013, black, white or hispanic?",white,"black , white",nabert,5db9216abb8740f961634e343ab921b3,"Which race had a higher IQ according to a study published in 2013, black, white or hispanic?",white,hispanic,naqanet,c9ddebe9b3b37075cfe54ccc955fe79b,Which race had the lowest IQ means range from 1971 to 2008 in the analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress?,black,black - white,nabert,5525f43d5420ac7eb00cb8abac2c947c,Which race had the lowest IQ means range from 1971 to 2008 in the analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress?,black,black-white IQ,naqanet,689cad2fb0e030945788cd93799ba215

"A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43,796 inhabitants, 79% of whom were Chinese (71% of the Chinese were Hakka people), 14% Malay, and 6% Indian. Another estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20,000. In 1931, 61% of Kuala Lumpurs 111,418 inhabitants were Chinese, and in 1947 63.5%. The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers, in part due to government employment, as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived. Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled, increasing from 12.5 to 15%, while the proportion of Chinese dropped. The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service, and later the implementation of the Malaysian New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business. In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million, with 52% Chinese, 33% Malay, and 15% Indian. From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77%, but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43% compared to Bumiputras at 38%. By the 2010 census, according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non-citizens, the percentage of the Bumiputera (Malaysia) population in Kuala Lumpur had reached around 45.9% (44.7% Malay), with the Chinese population at 43.2% and Indians 10.3%.",2c9d5d992b2db1bd76a9f409d1f45891,How many percent of people were not Bumiputras  in 2000?,62,39,naqanet,93a1daa635997a1ad9dab94b9d00f5be,How many percent of people were not Chinese in 1891?,21,71,naqanet,bf93d6986472e274f00c56e9adaa8f33,How many percent of people were not Chinese in 1931?,39,0,naqanet,0668578c1c662f07db1d2be8f478255b,How many percent of people were not Chinese in 1947?,36.5,0,naqanet,1ef40e41894d4cbe0f326780f42cda05,How many percent of people were not Chinese in 1980?,48,0,naqanet,b4c68c90a5b9eaccb1e9fb08d36a10ef,How many percent of people were not Chinese in 2000?,57,71,naqanet,d9fffd1c65d0cfa79850b0d147849272,How many percent of people were not Indian in 1891?,94,0,naqanet,953cac8e05d68d57b14ad7f4a1a59f78,How many percent of people were not Indian in 1980?,85,0,naqanet,1b2a573f800e59410aab7a8593122009,How many percent of people were not Indian in 1980?,85,94.0,nabert,0178ad4aaaafb1aee2940a3e605ee736,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1891?,86,0,naqanet,a16f25519acc1ac7a27c11e49e6bb726,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1947?,87.5,0,naqanet,aeed26f4e2e85d97b94f166a97f5744a,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1947?,87.5,36.5,nabert,d5886b4448e73a56e86aa0e919d21658,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1957?,85,0,naqanet,8d660121aade34a2a82b793f62569532,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1957?,85,87.5,nabert,86bafff4ad84962a1a3f001c299a737c,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1980?,67,0,naqanet,56ed0512550465ccae3e8d11714678f7,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"A power outage that disrupted play in the third quarter served as a fitting metaphor for the Giants' general lack of power on the field this night. Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered during practice, and backup receiver Ramses Barden saw his season come to an end during this game by way of a torn Achilles tendon. Former Giant Jason Garrett was making his head coaching debut for a Cowboys team revitalized by the firing of head coach Wade Phillips one week earlier. The Dallas defense held the Giants to just 6 points in the first half, aided by cornerback Bryan McCann's 101-yard ""pick 6"" from his own end zone. In a dimly lit third quarter, after a bank of lights went dark, Felix Jones extended the Cowboys' lead to 20 points on a 71-yard touchdown reception. Only after a total blackout caused an eight-minute play stoppage did Manning finally put the Giants' first touchdown on the board, in the form of a 5-yard pass to Manningham. The teams continued to trade touchdowns; a 24-yard pass from Kitna to Austin was followed by a 35-yard reception by Boss. But the Giants' turnover problem resurfaced in the fourth quarter, where a fumble and an interception ended up costing them any chance at a comeback.",7227fd1d161dc440acddb872efd4cc84,How long did the power stay out?,eight-minute,71-yard,naqanet,fe1af8ba5011c29515d7450bf1b14f0f,How long did the power stay out?,eight-minute,power outage,nabert,87f1f26110585650f8059eeafe78efd4,How many quarters did Smith play?,0,1,naqanet,eeded43977970841bdb98e5e768fad38,How many quarters did Smith play?,0,2,nabert,619d2f3c21195f16f347e57fe97e5c19,What quarter did the Giants get their first touchdown?,third quarter,fourth quarter,nabert,0db4a2dfa4d79732988717263ba8d111,What quarter did the Giants get their first touchdown?,third quarter,third,naqanet,c17c7b39e7fbb23151c7f0e5ec4f7515,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"According to Finnish historians, the casualties of the Finnish Defence Forces amounted to 63,204 dead or missing and around 158,000 wounded. Officially, the Soviets captured 2,377 Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union, although Finnish researchers estimated the number to be around 3,500 prisoners. 939 Finnish civilians died in air raids and 190 civilians were killed by Soviet partisans. Germany suffered approximately 84,000 casualties in the Finnish front, 16,400 killed, 60,400 wounded and 6,800 missing. In addition to the original peace terms of restoring the 1940 border, Finland was required to Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union, conduct War-responsibility trials in Finland, lease Porkkalanniemi to the Soviets as well as ban fascist elements and allow left-wing groups, such as the Communist Party of Finland. A Soviet-led Allied Control Commission was installed to enforce and monitor the peace agreement in Finland. The requirement to disarm or expel any German troops left on Finnish soil by 15 September 1944 eventually escalated into the Lapland War between Finland and Germany and the evacuation of the 200,000-strong 20th Mountain Army to Norway.",0c46f6214ef56b0a1418943cb7a4099c,How many Finnish civilians were killed?,1129,939,nabert,e3494b0a79a97ae588cccdb13a628d10,How many more Germans were wounded than killed or missing combined?,50800,0,naqanet,80bb6b6a8bb8c269a1226a6cd3dc4af2,How many more Germans were wounded than killed or missing combined?,50800,44000.0,nabert,a875abb967f21430007a076a6e50223d,"How many total Germans were killed, wounded and missing?",83600,67200,naqanet,578d098625991e6885872ec8d5e87c1f,"How many total Germans were killed, wounded and missing?",83600,79604.0,nabert,95f8a1bf7e7375354c98e76f56833cb9,Were more German casualties killed or missing?,killed,missing,naqanet,7f2d189467882455db73969ce11bdf59,Were more civilians killed by air raids of by Soviet partisans?,air raids,749,naqanet,141aaa302e4ed4d676617109dc9bb9c9,Were more civilians killed by air raids of by Soviet partisans?,air raids,civilians killed by air raids,nabert,e725bed188a03fafdd9419d477a88fa7,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"According to West German figures in late 1944 the Soviets transported 27,000 to 30,000 ethnic Germans, a majority of whom were women aged 18 to 35, to the Ukraine and the Donbass for forced labour; about 20% (5,683) were reported dead or missing. Data from Russian archives published in 2001, based on an actual enumeration, put the number of German civilians deported from Yugoslavia to the USSR in early 1945 for reparations labour at 12,579, where 16% (1,994) died. After March 1945, a second phase began in which ethnic Germans were massed into villages such as Gakovo and Kruševlje that were converted into labour camps. All furniture was removed, straw placed on the floor, and the expellees housed like animals under military guard, with minimal food and rampant, untreated disease. Families were divided into the unfit women, old, and children, and those fit for slave labour. A total of 166,970 ethnic Germans were interned, and 48,447 (29%) perished.

"Advancing to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1994, the Canucks opened the fourth round against the Boston Bruins with a 1-0 win in Game 1. Winger Raffi Torres scored the winning goal with 18.5 seconds remaining. The following game, the Canucks won 3-2 in overtime with Burrows scoring the winner 11 seconds into the extra frame, making it the second fastest overtime goal in Stanley Cup Finals history. As the series shifted from Rogers Arena to TD Garden for Games 3 and 4, Boston tied the series with 8-1 and 4-0 victories. Game 3 marked the highest score by one team in a Finals game since the Colorado Avalanche defeated the Florida Panthers in 1996 Stanley Cup Finals. During the contest, the Bruins lost first-line forward Nathan Horton for the remainder of the series when he suffered a serious concussion from a controversial hit by Canucks defenceman Aaron Rome, who received a four-game suspension as a result. Returning to Vancouver for Game 5, the Canucks won 1-0 with a goal from late-season acquisition Maxim Lapierre in the third period. With an opportunity to win the Stanley Cup in Boston, Vancouver lost Game 6 by a 5-2 score. The Bruins first four goals occurred in a span of four minutes and 14 seconds during the first period, setting a Finals record for the fastest four goals scored by a team (surpassing the previous mark of five minutes and 29 seconds set by the Montreal Canadiens in 1956 Stanley Cup Finals).

"After 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009. In 2009 the U.S. membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of private sector unions for the first time, at 7.9 million and 7.4 million respectively. In 2011 states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack especially in Wisconsin, as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures. Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain.  Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.",435ed61f2d47247cef38aa995baa2496,How many jobs did state and local-government raise between 1950-1976?,8000000,8,naqanet,d90bee0a2e0c1abea5099c1c42950b4e,How many millions did public sector union membership surpass private sector union membership by?,0.5,2,naqanet,eeb7ab0d167c72dbcde019b700620d80,How many more state and government jobs were there in 2009 than 1976?,4600000,4600000.000000002,nabert,3eb43f6114ee98aa1a0742a7fbfefab5,How many more state and government jobs were there in 2009 than 1976?,4600000,8,naqanet,56fe4a66cd20a738824d192e55114b15,How many more union jobs were there in 2009 compared to 1950?,12600000,12600000.000000002,nabert,0c519c3b0e08d9a54bbd018c62862e87,How many more union jobs were there in 2009 compared to 1950?,12600000,8,naqanet,bde88017a5ae2e614d8d0cddc29b2562,How many state and local government employees increased from 1950 to 2009?,12600000,12600000.000000002,nabert,dce3b342005cc75f4ecb8aa7f6291591,How many state and local government employees increased from 1950 to 2009?,12600000,3,naqanet,4672a7ffa7dacec2af8d986e836a9223,How many states did public sector unions come under attack from Republican legislatures?,4,3,naqanet,12b050efc8932d463456f0d9a97eaac1,How many states had public sector unions come under heavy attack?,4,3,naqanet,560e2842a513064dfdc3dad38fab44e6,How many years did it take to quadruple state- and local-government employment?,59,-1917,naqanet,58d0633e23171ac3bd0bda96d7c15db7,How many years did it take to quadruple state- and local-government employment?,59,26.0,nabert,b0b1ab63ba23a450afc450e9aa8bfc23,What did the Conservatives argue public unions were too powerful for?,helped elect their bosses overly generous pension systems,elect their bosses,nabert,391ab9c4eb7731c35031795584cb998f,What did the Conservatives argue public unions were too powerful for?,helped elect their bosses overly generous pension systems,overly generous pension systems,naqanet,f46915ee89befe1d3bb3bdfbb169fd9a,Which states had the public sector unions come under heavy attack?,Wisconsin Indiana New Jersey Ohio,Wisconsin,naqanet,604755b822d5d9c4a2eda5e9ba5c194e,Which year had the most workers?,2009,1976,naqanet,598efe55b443a4842546a65022f92c2c,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"After Atahualpa's execution, Pizarro installed Atahualpa's brother, Túpac Huallpa, as a puppet Inca ruler, but he soon died unexpectedly, leaving Manco Inca Yupanqui in power. He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa's generals Rumiñahui, Zope-Zupahua and Quisquis, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire.:221-223,226 Archaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007. Forensic evidence suggests that the natives were killed by European weapons, probably during the uprising in 1536. Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled. Under the pretense of recovering a statue of pure gold in the nearby Yucay valley, Manco was able to escape Cuzco.:235-237",548d3ffa4368c252fc7ccc26f9b88820,"What happened second, the remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway or evidence showing natives were killed with European weapons?",Forensic evidence,"women , and adolescents",nabert,006f9ad73ae44cdf8af7393bb69d257b,"What happened second, the remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway or evidence showing natives were killed with European weapons?",Forensic evidence,"women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway or evidence showing natives were killed with European weapons",naqanet,3df8263d58fadf0f1b08b1e1922aab7a,Who did Tupac Huallpa succeed as Inca ruler?,Atahualpa,manco inca yupanqui,nabert,3bbe3a18213a30729371a78f5dfaa378,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"After Culloden, government forces spent the next few weeks searching for rebels, confiscating cattle and burning Non-Juring Episcopalian and Catholic meeting houses; many of those who participated in the Rebellion came from this element of Scottish society. Prisoners from regiments in the French service were treated as POWs and exchanged, but 3,500 captured Jacobites were indicted for treason. 650 of these died awaiting trial, 120 were executed , 900 were pardoned and the rest transported. The Jacobite lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino and Lovat were beheaded on Tower Hill in April 1747, but these were among the last executions. Public sympathies had shifted and Cumberland's insistence on severity earned him the nickname 'Butcher' from a City of London alderman.

"After William's landing in England, James' Lord Deputy in Ireland, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell took action to ensure that all strong points in Ireland were held by garrisons of the newly recruited Irish Catholic army, loyal to James. The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison. A Jacobite army of around 1,200 men, mostly ""Redshanks"" , under Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised . When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained. Nevertheless, a Jacobite force under Richard Hamilton routed a Protestant Williamite militia in an encounter at Dromore, County Down  on 14 March 1689 and occupied eastern Ulster.",941aec2c8d927f5ee8a2668feaaf5103,"How many months after the Siege of Derry did a Jacobite force route a Protestant Williamite militia in an encounter at Dromore, County Down?",3,2,naqanet,e3bbd9b3292a7b4578f75398b45a52e4,How many months after the Siege of Derry did the encounter at Dromore County Down take place?,3,1,nabert,8a7d126b25369a8ce8cbec9f8f426336,How many months after the Siege of Derry did the encounter at Dromore County Down take place?,3,2,naqanet,fa86c11c41dbb785d91657666d6ad792,In what city did the Jacobites defeat an uprising?,Bandon,"Ireland were held by garrisons of the newly recruited Irish Catholic army, loyal to James.

"After a convincing win over a struggling Redskins team in Week 7, the Colts faced one of their toughest opponents of the year in the Denver Broncos. The Broncos sat atop the AFC West standings with a 5-1 record thanks in large part to a strong running game and a dominating defense that had only allowed two touchdowns on the season. Both defenses played well in the first quarter, which ended with the Colts leading 3-0. Denver took the lead early in the second quarter on a Jake Plummer one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis cut the lead to one on their next drive, which ended in a 30-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal, but the Broncos answered with a 15-yard touchdown pass from QB Jake Plummer to WR Javon Walker just before halftime to expand their lead to 14-6. On their first drive of the half Indianapolis came within one point of the lead on a 12-yard touchdown pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne. On the Colts' next possession, Wayne and Manning hooked up again for another touchdown, this one a 5-yard TD pass to take the lead 20-14. But the Broncos came back with a one-yard touchdown run by Mike Bell, giving them a one-point lead at the end of the third quarter. After a Vinatieri field goal and another Denver touchdown, the Colts were down by 5 points with a little over half of the fourth quarter remaining. After the Colts received the kickoff, they marched down the field. The drive ended with a 19-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Wayne, the third time they hooked up for a touchdown in the game. The Colts were now up by one point and decided to go for the two-point conversion to go up by a field goal. The conversion was a success as Manning found Reggie Wayne in the end zone again. Jason Elam came through for Denver and made a 49-yard field goal to tie the game at 31. The final drive of the game resulted in an Adam Vinatieri field goal with two seconds left to put Indianapolis up by three. Manning ended the game with three touchdown passes, all of them to Reggie Wayne. Rookie RB Joseph Addai had a career-high 93 yards rushing on only 17 carries.

"After successive defeats suffered in the revolutions of 1890 and 1893, and not having achieved free and fair elections, the Radical Civic Union entered a serious crisis, which deepened after 1896 with the suicide of Leandro N. Alem and the death of Aristóbulo del Valle. In 1897, Hipólito Yrigoyen, profoundly disagreeing with the direction of agreements imposed by Bernardo de Irigoyen, dissolved the Committee of the RCU in the province of Buenos Aires, due to which the radical party practically ceased to exist. The dissolution of the Radical Civic Union resulted in the formation of a core of radical elements that recognized as their leader Hipólito Yrigoyen. Onto this core - composed of young men, recruited from the middle class, professionals, businessmen, employees, ranchers of the old federal tradition, settlers and laborers from the countryside - was Yrigoyen able to impose discipline and enthusiasm. In this context, in 1903 Hipólito Yrigoyen began his revival and reorganization. On February 29 of 1904, after 7 years of inactivity, the National Committee of the Radical Civic Union said the electoral abstention of all the radicals of the Republic in the elections of representatives from the nation, senators from the capital, electors for president and vice president of the nation, and announced an armed resistance.",13ea9d0952f31032078023863e7ad9b1,"Before 1904, when was the last time National Committee of the Radical Civic Union was active?",1897,-7.0,nabert,21de4c5246cec144c6e462235e3828f5,"Before 1904, when was the last time National Committee of the Radical Civic Union was active?",1897,1904,naqanet,edeea9030df118a70747aa9e41933ea0,How many years after the revolution of 1890 did the next revolution follow for the Radical Civic Union?,3,6,naqanet,c6bc828758307d72893835b2411b6235,How many years was there where nobody fought?,7,14,naqanet,1719477bea2a0a4ba8c9a71699b0a424,"Who died first, Leandro N.

"After the Battle of Deçiq Ottoman government decided for peaceful means of suppression of the revolt because frequent clashes with Albanians attracted the attention of the  European Great Powers. On 11 June sultan Mehmed V visited Skopje where he was greeted enthusiastically by the local population together with two Albanian chieftains who swore their allegiance to the Ottoman sultan. On 15 June, the date of the Battle of Kosovo, he visited the site of the historical battle greeted by 100.000 people. During his visit to Kosovo vilayet he signed a general amnesty for all participants of the Albanian revolts of 1910 and 1911. He was welcomed by the choir of the Serbian Orthodox Seminary with Turkish songs and vice-consul Milan Rakić had gathered a large contingent of Serbs, but many Albanians boycotted the event. Ottoman representatives managed to deal with the leaders of Albanian rebels in Kosovo Vilayet and Scutari Vilayet separately, because they were not united and lacked central control. The Ottoman Empire first managed to pacify the northern Albanian malësorë  from Scutari Vilayet reaching a compromise during a meeting in Podgorica. In order to resolve the problems in the south, the Ottoman representatives invited Albanian southern leaders to a meeting in Tepelenë on 18 August 1911. They promised to meet most of their demands, like general amnesty, the opening of Albanian language schools, and the restriction that military service was to be performed only in the territory of the vilayets with substantial Albanian population.  Other demands included requiring administrative officers to learn the Albanian language, and that the possession of weapons would be permitted.",4b4e36f538ea05b42629e0fcf51a08e5,How many Albanian revolts did Mehmed V sign general amnesty for all participants during his visit to Kosovo vilayet?,2,3,naqanet,ed16ba7497926fa0aec67c3b71098718,How many promises did the Ottoman representatives make to the Albanian leaders?,5,2,naqanet,0df36659324162c78bd517ea903b72c2,How many promises did the Ottoman representatives make to the Albanian leaders?,5,3,nabert,89e1ab5014a68dfcb624c0381d2f8d78,How many years received general amnesty?,2,1,naqanet,8c42798820bf301951d58859410bff6b,"Where did Mehmed V visit first, the site of the historical battle or Kosovo vilayet?",site of the historical battle,battle,naqanet,6529cc1d024be841143b63fb57e180d4,"Where did Mehmed V visit first, the site of the historical battle or Kosovo vilayet?",site of the historical battle,kosovo vilayet,nabert,d4de2e826de1ce85cab79e3ddeeca335,Where was Mehmed V visiting when many Albanians boycotted the event?,Kosovo,Skopje,naqanet,907e9927bbbbed964d31e53f3904e7eb,Which group of Albanian leaders were pacified first?,the northern Albanian malësorë,Ottoman sultan,naqanet,55fea51817e7874c33eb465dbd0be433,Which group of Albanian leaders were pacified first?,the northern Albanian malësorë,"mehmed v visited skopje where he was greeted enthusiastically by the local population together with two albanian chieftains who swore their allegiance to the ottoman sultan . on 15 june , the date of the battle of kosovo , he visited the site of the historical battle greeted by 100 . 000 people . during his visit to kosovo vilayet he signed a general amnesty for all participants of the albanian revolts of 1910 and 1911 . he was welcomed by the choir of the serbian orthodox seminary with turkish songs and vice - consul milan rakic had gathered a large contingent of serbs , but many albanians boycotted the event . ottoman representatives managed to deal with the leaders of albanian rebels in kosovo vilayet and scutari vilayet separately , because they were not united and lacked central control . the ottoman empire first managed to pacify the northern albanian malesore",nabert,228efa9c1b85460fb02afe7dd9bb9847,"Which happened first, the Battle of Kosovo or the Battle of Deçiq?",the Battle of Deçiq,Battle of Kosovo,naqanet,7c3f9654fa9ffc025387094026e40bb5,"Which happened first, the Battle of Kosovo or the Battle of Deçiq?",the Battle of Deçiq,the battle of deciq,nabert,338d062cd363fd784b63047b804ebbb8,"Which happened first, the meeting in Tepelenë or the meeting in Podgorica?",the meeting in Podgorica,meeting in Tepelenë,naqanet,94aa8ea93499e0a6ed5461cb03f06b52,Who visited the site of the historic Battle of Kosovo?,sultan Mehmed V,vilayet,naqanet,b29ccca48e622d124545a44db5e288b2,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"After the Restoration Charles II pulled together four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of £122,000 from his general budget. This became the foundation of the permanent English Army. By 1685 it had grown to 7,500 soldiers in marching regiments, and 1,400 men permanently stationed in garrisons.  A Monmouth Rebellion in 1685 allowed James II of England to raise the forces to 20,000 men.  There were 37,000 in 1678, when England played a role in the closing stage of the Franco-Dutch War.  After William III of England and Mary II of England accession to the throne England involved itself in the War of the Grand Alliance, primarily to prevent a French invasion restoring James II (Marys father).  In 1689,  William III expanded the army to 74,000, and then to 94,000 in 1694.  Parliament was very nervous, and reduced the cadre to 7000 in 1697.

"After the end of Forty Years' War in 1424, Ava gave up its dream of rebuilding the Pagan Empire. Instead, for the next six decades, it would struggle to hold on to its vassal states. Rebellions arose every time a new king came to power. The new king would have to reestablish his power all over again by gaining the fealty of all the vassal states, usually by show of force. Of these, the remote vassal state of Toungoo , tucked away in the southeastern corner across the Pegu Yoma range, proved most troublesome to successive kings at Ava. Toungoo lords rebelled against Ava in 1426-1440, 1451-1459 and 1468-1470, usually with Pegu's implicit or explicit support. Ava also faced rebellions at Mohnyin  and Prome . The beginning of the end of Ava came in 1480. The new king Minkhaung II was greeted with a multitude of rebellions but it proved to be different this time.

"After the fall of Pegu in December 1599, Lower Burma was in utter chaos, and politically fragmented among Toungoo, Prome, Arakanese/Portuguese Syriam and Siamese Martaban. In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma. In early 1606, his 7,000-strong forces took Theinni, Thibaw and Momeik but the king died during the campaign on 3 March 1606.",2b268eeb26483a256887abf2e841c5bf,"How many months after Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo did he declare himself king?",4,2,naqanet,85bb3f96cc49518d9be6e6439a10320a,How many months after Pegu fall did Nyaungyan declare himself king?,2,1,nabert,bb08f368df93641ebde05200b9264b56,How many months after Toungoo and Arakanese laid siege on Pegu did it fall?,4,1,nabert,bb4a2145e9e86cbbf554e09762b3a1d8,How many months after Toungoo and Arakanese laid siege on Pegu did it fall?,4,2,naqanet,5f45463c452eaa97fb220b7dce6dec40,How many years after Pegu fell did the king die?,7,-1593,naqanet,ccca8b900fa3ee19a8bdd09a63dea157,Nyaungyan declared himself king how many years before the march to attack Mone?,5,-1600,naqanet,8f4a69d03281429bfe1a6df81d3df068,What states did Nyaungyan recapture in 1601 and 1603 after he became king?,Nyaungshwe Mone,Bhamo,naqanet,b721f41b0bfff9a9d799e42e3e7ba098,What states did Nyaungyan recapture in 1601 and 1603 after he became king?,Nyaungshwe Mone,shan state of mone,nabert,fc02075dfa9bfb6f01ef4c7b14ab66d5,When did  Naresuan of Siam die?,April 1605,1605,naqanet,8b4376fccfcd8e04e175425e3c3e33c4,When did Naresuan of Siam die?,April 1605,1605,naqanet,294e0bf274a2981a58313afa300890f6,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"After twelve years of peace following the Indian Wars of 1622-1632, another Anglo-Powhatan War began on March 18, 1644, as a last effort by the remnants of the Powhatan Confederacy, still under Opechancanough, to dislodge the English settlers of the Virginia Colony. Around 500 colonists were killed, but that number represented a relatively low percent of the overall population, as opposed to the earlier massacre . However, Opechancanough, still preferring to use Powhatan tactics, did not make any major follow-up to this attack. This was followed by a last effort by the settlers to decimate the Powhatan. In July, they marched against the Pamunkey, Chickahominy, and Powhatan proper; and south of the James, against the Appomattoc, Weyanoke, Warraskoyak, and Nansemond, as well as two Carolina tribes, the Chowanoke and Secotan. In February 1645, the colony ordered the construction of three frontier forts: Fort Charles at the falls of the James, Fort James on the Chickahominy, and Fort Royal at the falls of the York. In August, Governor William Berkeley stormed Opechancanough's stronghold and captured him. All captured males in the village over age 11 were deported to Tangier Island. Opechancanough, around 92 years old, was taken to Jamestown where he was shot in the back by a guard. Opechancanough's death resulted in the disintegration of the Powhatan Confederacy into its component tribes, whom the colonists continued to attack. In March 1646, the colony decided to build a fourth frontier fort, Fort Henry, at the falls of the Appomattox, where the modern city of Petersburg is located.",329c7d293105f3d393499e25b2f42b0c,How did Opechancanough die?,shot in the back,shot,nabert,c934039fea6c15353c182c1270165028,How did Opechancanough die?,shot in the back,shot in the back by a guard,naqanet,b7985083c4e005dede32b7953c026208,How many tribes did the settlers march against in July?,9,2,naqanet,646d69ca7c5d780a6a87fe217b80d442,How many tribes did the settlers march against in July?,9,4,nabert,cd2dca487a1ecf6938cbb1a0c9aef35c,What happened first: Anglo-Powhatan War began or Fort Henry?,Anglo-Powhatan War,Anglo-Powhatan War began,naqanet,1e543b3da1d94d5f552f474940d7c371,"Which fort was built last, Fort James or Fort Henry?",Fort James,Fort Henry,naqanet,75c36d7b02a4b878cda1dba7f2be62d5,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"After winning at home, the Bengals traveled down south to take on the Jaguars.  The Jags scored first in the first quarter when Josh Lambo kicked a 32-yard field goal to make it 3-0.

"All these problems came to a head on 1 June 1648, upon Alexei I's return to Moscow from the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra monastery. A crowd of Muscovites surrounded the Tsar and complained about the boyars and prikaz officials. Instead of hearing the petition, the royal bodyguards started dispersing the crowd, pushing them away from the Tsar. This unexpected reaction caused a major outbreak of anger among the people. On 2 June the insurgents burst into the Moscow Kremlin and demanded the surrender of Leontii Pleshcheyev , Duma diak Nazar Chistoy , boyar Boris Morozov  and his brother-in-law Pyotr Trakhaniotov . Morozov commanded the Streltsy  to drive the rioters out of the Kremlin, but they refused. When not acting as the Tsar's bodyguards, the musketeers held artisanal jobs in Moscow. This conflict of interest led them to side with the plight of the townsmen, stating that they, ""...did not want to stand in antagonistic relations with the crowd for the sake of the traitor and tyrant Pleshcheyev."" The people would not hear the Tsar's heartfelt pleas to spare Pleshceyev and, on June 3, Alexei surrendered the official. In their fervor, the crowd did not wait for Pleshcheyev to be executed instead, ""...they cuggeled him so black and blue and with axes they cut him asunder like a fish, the pieces they let lie naked here and there."" The rebels set fire to the White City and Kitai-gorod. They burned between 15,000 and 24,000 houses; between 1700 and 2000 people died in the riot. The rioters split into two groups to target the most hated boyars, diaks, okolnichys, and merchants, killing Nazar Chistoy as he begged for mercy. When rumors spread that Morozov's men had started the fires to antagonize the rioters, the boyar head hunt gained greater momentum.",69444c0023d321204df98a37fb6a1ffe,How did the rioters execute Pleshceyev?,they cuggeled him,him so black and blue and with axes they cut him asunder like a fish,naqanet,45728e8ed1419c2c7f20c3a2ab210ab2,How did the rioters execute Pleshceyev?,they cuggeled him,"traitor and tyrant pleshcheyev .

"Although it failed to dislodge the Burmese from Kengtung and Sipsongpanna at the beginning of the century , Siam never gave up its claims on these lands. They tested the waters in 1849, by raiding as far north as Kengtung. But when the Second Anglo-Burmese War started, the Siamese viewed it as their opportunity to take over the trans-Salween states. In late 1852, a large infantry and elephant force marched from Chiang Mai and launched a two-pronged invasion of Kengtung. Burma couldrespond only after the new king Mindon had seized power in February 1853. Because he was still concerned about the British threat, Mindon could only send several thousand infantry troops from the Mone  garrison to relieve the Siamese siege of Kengtung. With the troops by Kenghung sawbwa, the Burmese eventually drove out the Siamese but only after heavy loss of life. In 1854, the largest Siamese invasion force, consisted of Laotian levies, tried once more. But this time, with the British front quiet, the Burmese were ready. Mindon had deployed a larger, well-equipped army . The Siamese forces again reached Kengtung but could not break through.

"Another factor in the revolt of 1381 was the conduct of the war with France. In 1337 Edward III of England had pressed his claims to the French throne, beginning a long-running conflict that became known as the Hundred Years' War. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England. By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in Calais and Brest alone, for example, were costing £36,000 a year to maintain, while military expeditions could consume £50,000 in only six months.

"Arizona dominated St Louis to win the NFC West and clinch their first home playoff game since 1947. Arizona took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter after a one-yard TD run by Tim Hightower and a Kurt Warner 12-yard TD pass to Larry Fitzgerald. In the second quarter the Rams would score on a three-yard TD pass from Marc Bulger to Steven Jackson, following a Kurt Warner interception. The Cardinals would respond with two field goals from Neil Rackers from 44 and 22 yards to make the halftime score 20-7. In the third quarter, Cardinals linebacker, Gerald Hayes, would force two Steven Jackson fumbles, the second one recovered by Darnell Dockett, who would return it 11 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. Down 27-7, the Rams attempted to come back in the fourth quarter, starting with a Josh Brown 51-yard field goal to make the score 27-10, but a Bulger pass was intercepted by rookie cornerback, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, for 99 yards, for the touchdown that sealed the game and propelled the Cardinals to their first playoff game since 1998, and their first division title since the days the Cardinals were in St. Louis in 1975.",1edbdf1c822225ce1f59cf866bca2b48,How many total field goals were kicked in the game?,3,4,naqanet,914becfdc7e21568895e02926c1162f1,How many total touchdowns were scored in the game?,5,7,nabert,14d7c8f4ef83d7fbce9cbbb7ea86497a,how many yards did Hightower run?,1,one,nabert,1e651b3ca96eb93810ccd4a9c5456914,how many yards did Rackers make?,66,44,naqanet,9246168ff91ce2d0e12fdbd9f8bb76ee,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Armenia gave way to communist power in late 1920. The Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started on the 29th of November 1920. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan, when the Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of the Nagorno-Karabagh and Syunik regions of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik as a self-governing region on December 25, 1920. In January 1921 Drastamat Kanayan sent a telegram to Njdeh, suggesting allowing the sovietisation of Syunik, through which they could gain the support of the Bolshevik government in solving the problems of the Armenian lands. Njdeh again proved himself as a long-sighted politician, he did not depart from Syunik and continued his struggle against the Red Army and Soviet Azerbaijan.",cf32c61acdb72795942cb260d1ef0278,How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia did  actual transfer of power take place?,3,0.0,nabert,aa646288c29e7c4ed85e3987f733bbf6,How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia did  actual transfer of power take place?,3,23,naqanet,b0f76c2076ee374f47a1f673a7751217,How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia did the actual transfer of power take place?,3,0.0,nabert,c30466ec8ccf39559865745c6fe19ee0,How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia did the actual transfer of power take place?,3,23,naqanet,ec2db811704476c21b1e8faf46589b3b,How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started did  Garegin Nzhdeh declare Syunik as a self-governing region?,26,23,naqanet,7377407862ee165cf80e5f97edb03351,How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started did  Garegin Nzhdeh declare Syunik as a self-governing region?,26,24.0,nabert,a728a2b6a34e79496a52b906037fe691,How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started did the actual transfer of power take place in Yerevan?,3,0.0,nabert,896428630796035dbf67f2c0de052837,How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started did the actual transfer of power take place in Yerevan?,3,23,naqanet,d7af36173664215569e18c28cca9258b,How many days passed from when the invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started to when Syunik was declared as a self-governing region,26,23,naqanet,e0949eb1f89817771d9698593a27525e,How many days was it between the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia and the official transfer of power occured in Yerevan?,3,0.0,nabert,b125c91663dd1584b23db014131b9397,How many days was it between the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia and the official transfer of power occured in Yerevan?,3,23,naqanet,9f5e9c8f09cf82ae06c758477a6b167a,How many promises did the soviets make?,3,2,naqanet,6a426433a1364577ea1fcc7071916b83,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"As Somalia gained military strength, Ethiopia grew weaker. In September 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie had been overthrown by the Derg , marking a period of turmoil. The Derg quickly fell into internal conflict to determine who would have primacy. Meanwhile, various anti-Derg as well as separatist movements began throughout the country. The regional balance of power now favoured Somalia. One of the separatist groups seeking to take advantage of the chaos was the pro-Somalia Western Somali Liberation Front  operating in the Somali-inhabited Ogaden area, which by late 1975 had struck numerous government outposts. From 1976 to 1977, Somalia supplied arms and other aid to the WSLF. A sign that order had been restored among the Derg was the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state on February 11, 1977. However, the country remained in chaos as the military attempted to suppress its civilian opponents in a period known as the Red Terror . Despite the violence, the Soviet Union, which had been closely observing developments, came to believe that Ethiopia was developing into a genuine Marxist-Leninist state and that it was in Soviet interests to aid the new regime. They thus secretly approached Mengistu with offers of aid that he accepted. Ethiopia closed the U.S. military mission and the communications centre in April 1977. In June 1977, Mengistu accused Somalia of infiltrating SNA soldiers into the Somali area to fight alongside the WSLF. Despite considerable evidence to the contrary, Barre strongly denied this, saying SNA ""volunteers"" were being allowed to help the WSLF.",2ea3a487e4d44bd3017e7b885a96af9e,How many months after Mengistu Haile Mariam was made head of state did Ethiopia close the U.S. military mission and the communications centre?,2,1966.0,nabert,58947fb357c189a04248dd2ed4cc7886,How many months after Mengistu Haile Mariam was made head of state did Ethiopia close the U.S. military mission and the communications centre?,2,3,naqanet,c3de0868e8860238e6b2054cb67c1978,How many months was it from the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state to Mengistu accusing Somalia of having SNA soldiers joining the WSLF?,4,2,naqanet,c713323ce049b6c594c9075e0453b84a,How many months was it from the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state to Mengistu accusing Somalia of having SNA soldiers joining the WSLF?,4,3,nabert,2dac1680326041bc11ada8cd99776b96,How many total years did Somalia supply arms and other aid to the WSLF?,2,1,naqanet,614061bede2fc05e798084233aeac309,How many years after the period of turmoil for the Dergs did the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state take place to try and restore order?,3,0.0,nabert,80a3f3695703b277061eb4df60465bbd,"What event happened first, separatist struck government outposts or Mengistu was accused of infiltrating into Somali?",struck numerous government outposts,numerous government outposts,nabert,118ad26b509594194e909c8409055dd4,Where were the Derg located?,Somalia,WSLF,naqanet,5f85a2ffd743cde9a12739c6d9c305ee,Where were the Derg located?,Somalia,ethiopia,nabert,3ee29d010f24d92bed3059e749f45cc7,"Which came first, the Red Terror or the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state?",the Red Terror,announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head,naqanet,319b96c8199eb30ecfe09c0c6ff31670,"Which came first, the Red Terror or the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state?",the Red Terror,announcement of mengistu haile mariam as head of state,nabert,c39d86b2208cc9c87d61a611ec36ca8f,"Which happened first, the closing of the military mission or Soviet Union approaching Mengistu with aid?",offers of aid,closing of the military mission,nabert,40b106390db571c8a4f2e562c255d1c0,"Which happened first, the closing of the military mission or Soviet Union approaching Mengistu with aid?",offers of aid,secretly approached Mengistu,naqanet,44be7a86541e119c41259710cf3d72ec,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"As a result of these deaths, Prime Minister Antonio Maura increased the Spanish garrison at Melilla from 5,000 men to 22,000 in preparation for an offensive. All the Spanish forces involved were conscripts; at this stage, Spain had neither professional troops, nor indigenous troops under arms. The Spanish army was poorly trained and equipped and lacked basic maps. The next day, the Spanish troops were shot at by francs-tireurs and skirmishes occurred near Melilla. General Marina decided to post six companies at Ait Aixa, under command of Colonel Álvarez Cabrera. They left Melilla at nightfall but got lost and, in the morning, found themselves in the Alfer Canyon, where they were decimated by gunfire from the heights. Colonel Cabrera and 26 men were killed, and 230 were wounded. On 26 June, the Spanish suffered a second defeat at the Lobo Canyon, when Marina sent another force under General Pintos to protect Segunda Caseta.

"As with most civil wars, the internecine conflict left a bitter legacy, which continues to influence Irish politics to this day. The two largest political parties in the republic through most of its history  were Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the descendants respectively of the anti-treaty and pro-treaty forces of 1922. Until the 1970s, almost all of Ireland's prominent politicians were veterans of the Civil War, a fact which poisoned the relationship between Ireland's two biggest parties. Examples of Civil War veterans include: Republicans Éamon de Valera, Frank Aiken, Todd Andrews, and Seán Lemass; and Free State supporters W. T. Cosgrave, Richard Mulcahy and Kevin O'Higgins. Moreover, many of these men's sons and daughters also became politicians, meaning that the personal wounds of the civil war were felt over three generations. In the 1930s, after Fianna Fáil took power for the first time, it looked possible for a while that the Civil War might break out again between the IRA and the pro-Free State Blueshirts. Fortunately, this crisis was averted, and by the 1950s violence was no longer prominent in politics in the Republic of Ireland. However, the breakaway IRA continued  to exist. It was not until 1948 that the IRA renounced military attacks on the forces of the southern Irish state when it became the Republic of Ireland. After this point, the organisation dedicated itself primarily to the end of British rule in Northern Ireland. The IRA Army Council still makes claim to be the legitimate Provisional Government of the Irish Republic declared in 1918 and annulled by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.",03082da1a26511d519a2be4ef449ae37,How many Civil War veterans are listed?,7,2,naqanet,0aa5a1b391a3336f059dc3c391225448,How many Civil War veterans are listed?,7,3.0,nabert,28855bbf30e50cdd96199664e7005ee0,How many Free State Supporter Civil War veterans are listed?,3,2,naqanet,c96b11cd40f148d704ce1fac7cb2ac68,How many Free State Supporter Civil War veterans are listed?,3,4,nabert,b00fbe8271ad2d381d587fe1b2565c82,How many republican Civil War veterans are listed?,4,2,naqanet,2d46d0293b0c0c4676b4e406441c75b7,How many years was the IRA Army Council the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic until it was annuled by the Anglo-Irish Treaty?,3,27.0,nabert,96af87848c8d8822dda51f13dc8675d1,What are Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael?,political parties,anti,nabert,9fdfae652be74d482eb5124474dfa1fc,What are Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael?,political parties,anti-treaty,naqanet,c68ff28ac808fb4421a728ea3422de24,What is the name of the treaty that was annulled,Anglo-Irish Treaty,Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921,naqanet,fe268b9f581808e6950ab18b59714f70,What were most of the politicians in Ireland?,veterans of the Civil War,Civil War,naqanet,4d84dcc9fc796e35ca5c5106d18e66d2,What were most of the politicians in Ireland?,veterans of the Civil War,fianna fail,nabert,486995376293fe8a2915df10c4edb870,Which political group in Ireland ascended to power first?,Fine Gael,fianna fail,nabert,a15945a375598f2fd0d175069cee6ca6,Which political group in Ireland ascended to power first?,Fine Gael,veterans of the Civil War,naqanet,1d88f486ac92322ab3caa8db218f1e50,Which political group in Ireland was pro-treaty?,Fine Gael,fianna fail,nabert,7592c301f5c3459ca20757a27008d5d4,Who did they fear would start another civil war?,IRA pro-Free State Blueshirts,Fine Gael,naqanet,2f2698b63872e7f2489cc0a9aa73433a,Who did they fear would start another civil war?,IRA pro-Free State Blueshirts,fianna fail and fine gael,nabert,1aee74a270bbce176ddecab7063213ff,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"At Pagan, the new king Kyawswa controlled just a small area outside the capital. Instead, the real power rested with three former Pagan commanders of nearby Myinsaing. It was the brothers, not the nominal sovereign Kyawswa, that sent a force to retake Lower Burma in 1294 after Wareru had decided to become a vassal of the Sukhothai Kingdom. Wareru drove back the Myinsaing forces. Concerned by the increasing power of the three brothers, Kyawswa submitted to the Mongols in January 1297, and was recognised by the Mongol emperor Temür Khan as viceroy of Pagan on 20 March 1297. In December 1297, the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa, and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom. In January 1300, the Myinsaing forces led by Athinhkaya seized the southernmost Mongol garrisons named Nga Singu and Male, just north of modern Mandalay. On 22 June 1300, the Mongol Emperor declared that Kumara Kassapa, one of Kyawswa's sons, was the rightful king of Burma, and sent in a 12,000-strong army from Yunnan. The Mongol army reached Male on 15 January 1301, and Myinsaing on 25 January. But they could not break through. The besiegers took the bribes given by the three brothers, and began their retreat on 6 April. But the commanders were executed by the Yunnan government when they got back. The Mongols sent no more invasions, and withdrew entirely from Upper Burma on 4 April 1303.",b41d6ea4f6f9451f9258fee979aa3514,How many months passed between the overthrow of Kyawswz and the seizing of Nga Singu?,1,2,naqanet,b7c0217f2a41f3da77d50aeda804249b,How many months passed from the submission of Kyawswa to the overthrow of Kyawswa?,11,2,naqanet,4b6d507b714492e6102db9f2b1019e97,"What happened first, the taking of Lower Burma, or the submission of Kyawswa?",Lower Burma,retake Lower Burma,naqanet,16ee069a4431eccd2685bbd57f0599de,Who controlled just a small area outside the capital?,Kyawswa,new king kyawswa,nabert,ce6a5acc1de9cba8139960360f6c6636,"Who declared that Kumara Kassapa, one of Kyawswa's sons, was the rightful king of Burma?",the Mongol Emperor,Emperor,naqanet,f12e52c0c9ac1618ec71a8662d1ab2bc,Who was Kumara Kassapa's father?,Kyawswa,Mongol Emperor,naqanet,136410ebb842de62f36c6fa89c574231,Who was Kumara Kassapa's father?,Kyawswa,wareru,nabert,2f8404057ea21d001c302cf482fd4258,Who was concerned by the increasing power of the three brothers?,Kyawswa,Temür Khan,naqanet,55cd77c9dbb2d003a1aca51caf880b21,Who was the Myinsaing Kingdom founded by?,the three brothers,Temür Khan,naqanet,58ae7db1a2124f2b25415fbcb7e08d55,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Ava's authority deteriorated further in Shwenankyawshin's reign . Three of the king's own brothers openly raised a rebellion in 1501. Mohnyin, Ava's former vassal, now began to raid its territory. In 1507, Ava ceded to Mohnyin all northern Avan territory down to present-day Shwebo in the vain hope that the raids would stop. It did not. Ava desperately tried to retain Toungoo's loyalty by ceding the key Kyaukse granary to Toungoo but it too failed. Toungoo took the region but formally broke away in 1510. Ava's only ally was the Shan state of Thibaw , which too was fighting Mohnyin's raids on its territory. Mohnyin was attacking other Shan states when it was not raiding Ava. It seized Bhamo from Thibaw in 1512 in the east, and raiding Kale in the west. The Ava-Thibaw alliance was able to retake Shwebo for a time but Mohnyin proved too strong. By the early 1520s, Chief Sawlon of Mohnyin had assembled a confederation of Shan states  under his leadership. Prome had also joined the confederation. The confederation wiped out Ava's defences in Shwebo in 1524. Finally on 25 March 1527, the forces of the confederation and Prome took Ava. The Confederation later sacked Prome in 1533 because Sawlon felt that Prome had not given sufficient help.",07b933e767b51c2a476699d97d51eed8,"After the rebellions began in 1501, how many years did Ava last before it was finally taken?",26,-1507,naqanet,4929fca828f3fa3f6709b0afac5844ba,"After the rebellions began in 1501, how many years did Ava last before it was finally taken?",26,6.0,nabert,43bd7988b611c569bc815ff0a24a69fb,How many years was it between when Ava ceded all northern Avan territory to Mohnyin and when the forces of the confederation and Prome took Ava?,17,20,naqanet,9c7366e9d97fb8fd645b77eb45c0fc10,What happened first: king's brothers raised a rebellion or confederation and Prome took Ava?,king's brothers raised a rebellion,king ' s brothers raised a rebellion,nabert,1e8c7894e6622587ea662134332ababc,Which cities did Mohnyin seize and raid in 1512?,Bhamo Kale,Bhamo,naqanet,58f6742225ad0b61e61c6c44f374a031,"Which happened first, the forces of the confederation and Prome taking Ava or the king's brothers raising a rebellion?",king's brothers raising a rebellion,king ' s own brothers openly raised a rebellion,nabert,892b160ddc1bb04582c0fe2948b217f6,"Which happened first, the forces of the confederation and Prome taking Ava or the king's brothers raising a rebellion?",king's brothers raising a rebellion,raised a rebellion,naqanet,83469f95bff1f5c4d6d9f140302ac28d,"Which happened first, the seizure of Bhamo or the sacking of Prome by the Confederation?",seizure of Bhamo,The Confederation later sacked Prome,naqanet,cba8063452c85e40a1523f7821a4b41d,"Which happened first, the seizure of Bhamo or the sacking of Prome by the Confederation?",seizure of Bhamo,seized bhamo,nabert,d1dc10f8d3baea2a0b7310dd66984801,Who seized Bhamo in 1512?,Mohnyin,Ava,naqanet,7996db96596f6b9dd106acba4e45ad9f,Who seized Bhamo in 1512?,Mohnyin,thibaw,nabert,5c677f154a64b40ef103ea23094f21a9,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Average daily ridership for DART has been in the vicinity of 200,000 riders per day over the last couple decades. In the 1st quarter of 1998, DARTs weekday ridership averaged 211,000 riders per day system-wide.

"Baldwin de Burg was a nephew of Baldwin I of Jerusalem and the Count of Edessa from 1100 to 1118. In 1118 his uncle died and he became King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. In the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, fought near Sarmada on 28 June 1119, the Franks suffered a disastrous defeat by the forces of Ilghazi, the ruler of Mardin. Later that year Baldwin regained some territory, but the Franks were seriously weakened. Baldwin asked for help from Pope Callixtus II. The pope forwarded the request to Venice. The terms of the crusade were agreed through negotiations between the envoys of Baldwin II and the doge of Venice. Once the Venetians decided to participate, Pope Callixtus II sent them his papal banner to signify his approval, At the First Council of the Lateran he confirmed that the Venetions had crusader privileges, including remission of their sins. The church also extended its protection to the families and property of the crusaders. In 1122 the Doge of Venice, Domenico Michiel, launched the seaborne crusade. The Venetian fleet of more than 120 ships carrying over 15,000 men left the Venetian Lagoon on 8 August 1122. This seems to have been the first crusade in which the knights brought their horses with them. They invested Corfu, then a possession of the Byzantine Empire, with which Venice had a dispute over privileges. In 1123 Baldwin II was captured by Balak of Mardin, emir of Aleppo, and imprisoned in Kharput. Eustace Graverius became regent of Jerusalem. The Venetians abandoned the siege of Corfu when they heard this news, and reached the Palestinian coast in May 1123.",c6187f55c12c46d3a251f6592217c076,How many days after the Battle of Ager Sanguinis did e Venetian fleet leave the Venetian Lagoon?,1137,112.0,nabert,41af1f8c0a2fea350362c3c0a656369e,How many days after the Battle of Ager Sanguinis did e Venetian fleet leave the Venetian Lagoon?,1137,20,naqanet,b30461a19e78ce4f4250fd9141a3f240,How many times before 1122 had the Venetian fleet knights taken their horses with them?,0,2,naqanet,7d2e878db6faa853507074393af81416,How many years after Baldwin de Burg became Count of Edessa did he become King Baldwin II of Jerusalem?,18,0.0,nabert,1d61e69af123891cb9e803239aef9fad,How many years after Baldwin de Burg became Count of Edessa did he become King Baldwin II of Jerusalem?,18,1118,naqanet,e09024b288453f20b66089c3b1661700,What caused the Venetians to abandon the siege of Corfu?,Baldwin II was captured,Palestinian coast,naqanet,afdfd69bfc87547986f01ea1568a1b7d,What caused the Venetians to abandon the siege of Corfu?,Baldwin II was captured,launched the seaborne crusade,nabert,55a7482de9206081c4b04e30001af591,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Before the Monthon reforms initiated by king Chulalongkorn, Siamese territories were divided into three categories: Inner Provinces forming the core of the kingdom, Outer Provinces that were adjacent to the inner provinces and tributary states located on the border regions. The area of southern Laos that came under Siamese control following the Lao rebellion  and destruction of Vientiane belonged to the later category, maintaining relative autonomy. Lao nobles who had received the approval of the Siamese king exercised authority on the Lao population as well as the Alak and Laven-speaking tribesmen. Larger tribal groups often raided weaker tribes abducting people and selling them into slavery at the trading hub of Champasak, while themselves falling prey to Khmer, Lao and Siamese slavers. From Champasak the slaves were transported to Phnom-Penh and Bangkok, thus creating a large profits for the slavers and various middlemen. In 1874 and 1884, king Chulalongkorn enacted two decrees banning the capture and sale of Kha slaves while also freeing all slaves born after 1868. Those abolitionist policies had an immediate effect on slave trading communities. In 1883, France attempted to expand its control in Southeast Asia by claiming that the Treaty of Huế extended into all Vietnamese vassal states. French troops gradually occupied the Kontum Plateau and pushed the Siamese from Laos following the Franco-Siamese War. A new buffer zone was thus created on the west bank of Mekong, as the area lacked the presence of the Siamese military local outlaws flocked the newly created safe haven. In 1899, Siam abolished the tributes collected from vassal states, replacing them with a new tax collected from all able bodied men, undermining the authority of Lao officials. The combined effects of the abolitionist laws and taxation led the Lao and Kha  nobility into an open rebellion.",ad5e7e0cd957ff455ebacc21d1698401,How many years apart were king Chulalongkorn's decrees regarding Kha slaves?,10,-6,naqanet,9fce215af955ea3abb0db4ce50f3100d,In which year was King Chulalongkorn's first decree banning the capture and sale of Kha slaves?,1874,0,naqanet,84e9fdd2b215ad4c43fa70811d36a2c1,Southern Laos belonged to which category of territory?,tributary states,Lao nobles,naqanet,5d0675483a9e2fed59b095a7a9fccc18,Southern Laos belonged to which category of territory?,tributary states,inner provinces,nabert,60c6c388cd6a17228bea723eb4e11d5f,What were the three areas that were formed when dividing the Siamese territories?,Inner Provinces Outer Provinces tributary states,Chulalongkorn,naqanet,37b636d9637a40a39c7924d839493742,What were the three areas that were formed when dividing the Siamese territories?,Inner Provinces Outer Provinces tributary states,inner provinces,nabert,aeb323bdf4c6b846003ecdc7a47d3d64,"Which event happened first, the Lao rebellion or when the French troops gradually occupied the Kontum Plateau?",the Lao rebellion,French troops gradually occupied the Kontum Plateau,naqanet,cf4f76853d95642ac098d9a6eb980f41,"Which event happened first, when king Chulalongkorn enacted two decrees banning the capture and sale of Kha slaves or when Siam abolished the tributes collected from vassal states?",king Chulalongkorn enacted two decrees banning the capture and sale of Kha slaves,Chulalongkorn enacted two decrees banning the capture,naqanet,029d5333fec4a0498d99f7527dc21409,"Which event happened first, when king Chulalongkorn enacted two decrees banning the capture and sale of Kha slaves or when Siam abolished the tributes collected from vassal states?",king Chulalongkorn enacted two decrees banning the capture and sale of Kha slaves,two decrees,nabert,b4d8cb6c72fd8218a2f8352fddec8272,"Which happened first, the Treaty of Huế or the banning Kha slave capture?",banning Kha slave capture,banning the capture,naqanet,653aae061ca2c4fb0de0fb6aaa665161,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Between 1874 and 1921, the total population of Cambodia increased from about 946,000 to 2.4 million. By 1950, it had increased to between 3,710,107 and 4,073,967, and in 1962 it had reached 5.7 million. From the 1960s until 1975, the population of Cambodia increased by about 2.2% yearly, the lowest increase in Southeast Asia. By 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took power, it was estimated at 7.3 million. Of this total an estimated one to two million reportedly died between 1975 and 1978. In 1981, the PRK gave the official population figure as nearly 6.7 million, although approximately 6.3 million to 6.4 million is probably more accurate.

"Beyond Indonesia's art deco architecture also much of the country's rail and road infrastructure as well as its major cities were built during the colonial period. Many of Indonesia's main cities were mere rural townships before colonial industrialization and urban development. Examples on Java include the capital Jakarta and Bandung, outside Java examples include Ambon and Menado city. Most main railroads and rail stations on Java as well as the main road, called Daendels Great Post Road  after the Governor General commissioning the work, connecting west to east Java were also built during the Dutch East Indies era. Between 1800 and 1950 Dutch engineers created an infrastructure including 67,000 kilometers  of roads, 7,500 kilometers  of railways, many large bridges, modern irrigation systems covering 1.4 million hectares  of rice fields, several international harbors, and 140 public drinking water systems.

"Brandenburg-Prussia's claims in Silesia were based, in part, on a 1537 inheritance treaty between the Silesian duke Frederick II of Legnica and the Hohenzollern Prince-Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg, whereby the Silesian duchies of Liegnitz, Wohlau and Brieg were to pass to the Electorate of Brandenburg if the Silesian Piasts should become extinct. At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the ""Great Elector"" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage.",40065a03a86bd374ca086e81b0ec6ba7,How many years after Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf was the Great Turkish War?,82,66,naqanet,2c4f21009903c24fc9de9a1f33d0606b,How many years after the Battle of White Mountain was won did the Emperor take back control of Schwiebus?,73,9.0,nabert,7a411b8b26c68e5c77aa390d6a6c1b27,How many years after the inheritance treaty between the Silesian duke  and the Hohenzollern Prince-Elector did the Piast line end,138,66,naqanet,acf12a056ef898c97a71f72d09dce5a7,How many years before Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War was the battle of white mountain won?,64,9.0,nabert,7ea69ccdb4a6cd601711db6e7f70ea6a,"What event happened second, the Battle of White Mountain or Joachim III Frederick inheriting the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf?",Battle of White Mountain,joachim iii frederick,nabert,33cc33846cd7895b3eaff10c711ad0da,What were the names of the people apart of the treaty?,Frederick II Joachim II,Frederick II of Legnica,naqanet,d83dd531f111b8c6e5ecbb60263d6455,What were the names of the people apart of the treaty?,Frederick II Joachim II,"duke frederick ii of legnica and the hohenzollern prince - elector joachim ii hector of brandenburg , whereby the silesian duchies of liegnitz",nabert,21492b520b565d8babee7aab0b089e8d,Which two wars are mentioned?,Thirty Years' War Great Turkish War,Brandenburg-Prussia,naqanet,be147079fcf1c1bbe7f13a0f5024cf3e,Which two wars are mentioned?,Thirty Years' War Great Turkish War,great turkish war,nabert,be012e2b06caa66581aa787a6b025c1c,Who did the inheritance treaty involve?,Frederick II of Legnica Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg,Frederick II of Legnica,naqanet,e4983c35cf6338df949ef334d28ea7cb,Who did the inheritance treaty involve?,Frederick II of Legnica Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg,brandenburg - prussia,nabert,012041bee1782482ab8137a6f5542156,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"By 2007, 56.8% of evacuees had found jobs, 22.3% were unemployed and seeking work, and 31.2% of evacuees were unemployed and living off government benefits rather than seeking work. The average monthly salary among the evacuees was NIS 5,380 (about $1,281), a slight rise of 2.1 percent from the average salary the year before. This was, however, a sharp drop of 39% from the settlers average monthly income before the disengagement. The average salary among evacuees was lower than the general average, as compared to above average before the disengagement. In addition to a drop in salary, the evacuees also suffered a drop in their standard of living due to the increased price of goods and services in their places of residence as compared to the settlements. Following the disengagement, settlers were temporarily relocated to hotels, sometimes for as long as half a year, before moving to mobile homes as temporary housing known as caravillas, before they could build proper homes. By June 2014, about 60% of evacuees were still living in these caravillas. Only 40% had moved to permanent housing, although construction of permanent settlements for the evacuees continues to progress. By July 2014, eleven towns for the evacuees had been completed with the expellees joining ten additional towns. Many of the permanent settlements under construction were given names reminiscent of the former Gaza settlements. By August 2014, unemployment among evacuees had dropped to 18%.

"By 2012, the USMC reported fleetwide readiness rate had risen to 68 percent; however, the DODs Inspector General later found 167 of 200 reports had ""improperly recorded"" information.

The required mission capable rate was 82%, but the average was 53% from June 2007 to May 2010. In 2010, Naval Air Systems Command aimed for an 85% reliability rate by 2018.

"By late August 1921, Spain lost all the territories it had gained since 1909. Spanish troops were pushed back to Melilla, which was their biggest base in the eastern Rif. Spain still had 14,000 soldiers in Melilla. However, Abd el-Krim ordered his forces not to attack the town. He subsequently told the writer J. Roger-Matthieu that since citizens of other European nations were residing in Melilla, it was feared they would intervene in the war should their citizens come to harm. Other reasons included the dispersal of Rifian fighters from several loosely allied tribes following the victory at Annual; and the arrival in Melilla of substantial reinforcements from the Legion and other Spanish units recalled from operations in western Morocco. By the end of August Spanish forces at Melilla numbered 36,000 under General Jose Sanjurjo and the slow process of recovering the lost territory could begin. Thus the Spanish could keep their biggest base in the eastern Rif. Later Abd el-Krim would admit: ""I bitterly regret this order. It was my biggest mistake. All the following tenor of events happened because of this mistake."" By January 1922 the Spanish had retaken their major fort at Monte Arruit  and had reoccupied the coastal plain as far as Tistutin and Batel. The Rifian forces had consolidated their hold of the inland mountains and stalemate was reached. The Spanish military suffered losses even at sea; in March the transport ship Juan de Joanes was sunk in Alhucemas Bay by Riffian coastal batteries, and in August 1923, while shelling Riffian positions, the battleship España ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas and was eventually scrapped in situ. In a bid to break the stalemate, the Spanish military turned to the use of chemical weapons against the Riffians.",401981693a1437e709b3d11ca7b6d351,What did Abd el-Krim call his order?,biggest mistake,attack the town,naqanet,fbc225b839884fd40dc2d5e9e1523c5a,What did Abd el-Krim call his order?,biggest mistake,not to attack,nabert,7747cb81a2dcd5e985a274e08d4eeb3d,What did Abd el-Krim regret not attacking?,Melilla,feared they would intervene,naqanet,c7aecd61626da50bef645896157166db,What did Abd el-Krim regret not attacking?,Melilla,the town,nabert,0acf630b8f5ff8e4e1fbbcc51711793d,"What event happened first, Spain loosing all territories it had gained since 1909, or the Spanish retaking their major fort at Monte Arruit.",Spain loosing all territories,Spain lost all the territories,naqanet,69ddf18466eb16b8929cc2443e2f987f,"What event happened first, Spain loosing all territories it had gained since 1909, or the Spanish retaking their major fort at Monte Arruit.",Spain loosing all territories,territories it had gained,nabert,8a8e39c2c6bc06feb7e72c7a25daaa37,"What event happened first, the Spanish military suffering losses even at sea, or the battleship Espana running aground?",Spanish military suffering losses,Spanish military suffered losses even at sea,naqanet,0c13829f732051bfc6f89fcd15d5d120,"What event happened first, the Spanish military suffering losses even at sea, or the battleship Espana running aground?",Spanish military suffering losses,battleship espana,nabert,763ea5f275823a363c55aa3643bf1aa0,What happened second: had retaken their major fort or España ran aground?,España ran aground,espana ran aground,nabert,5e7bedb23fc00623a3f7dde7c22e7af5,Where is the city that Abd el-Krim ordered his forces not to attack?,eastern Rif,Spain,naqanet,cfe56f394fe647ca7c16c0d5f88565fa,Where is the city that Abd el-Krim ordered his forces not to attack?,eastern Rif,melilla,nabert,9b09ba58338c0bc5340b0488c8869f05,"Which was the Spanish military first suffered losses at sea, Jaun de Joanes or Espana?",Juan de Joanes,Jaun de Joanes,naqanet,cdbdd58bfa438da7f96d4848cc59b489,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"By the end of 1986, Computer Entertainer claimed the Atari 7800 had sold 100,000 consoles in the United States, less than the Sega Master Systems 125,000 and the Nintendo Entertainment Systems 1.1 million. According to Atari, due to manufacturing problems, it only managed to produce and sell 100,000 units by 1986, including units that had been in a warehouse since 1984. A common complaint in 1986 was a lack of games, including a gap of months between new releases (Galagas release in August was followed by Xevious in November). By the end of 1986, the 7800 had 10 games, compared to Segas 20 and Nintendos 36; nine of the NES games were third-party, whereas the 7800 and Master System had no third-party games. A reason cited for the lack of third-party interest in the 7800 was its small 100,000 install base and low market penetration.",85fd839b5f3925da67729a61eec329f7,How many months passed between the release of Galagas and Xevious?,3,2,naqanet,51d6b28f7cb228c25220743a290bee7a,How many more games did the NES have available compared to the 7800?,26,27,naqanet,924118ca0d46c9d04e94dc977c154f64,How many more games did the NES have available compared to the 7800?,26,99990.0,nabert,1e1186a15fa030ef03720dfa28f90e88,Which console had sold the least by the end of 1986?,Atari 7800,Nintendos,naqanet,c83abdf2ef1110631dc4f92d7ca759d2,Which console had sold the most in 1986?,Nintendo Entertainment Systems,Computer Entertainer,naqanet,3228c9624d16944f380d300b726a260c,Which console had sold the most in 1986?,Nintendo Entertainment Systems,atari 7800,nabert,9b4c38fb4bba39bf27d5a2adca7c0f7c,Which consols had 20 or less games available by the end of 1986?,Segas 7800,7800,nabert,3cabc9351800fcdc4c7fdfdf923a018f,Which consols had 20 or less games available by the end of 1986?,Segas 7800,By the end of 1986,naqanet,45bd17957046b79a31dde3075f607ea5,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"By this time Hu Zongxian had almost collected his strength: Lu Tang had won a decisive victory in Taizhou south of Ningbo and came back to help deal with Xu Hai; while 6000 fresh aboriginal soldiers from Baojing and Yongshun were on its way to come to Hu Zongxian's aid. The imperial inspector Zhao Wenhua reiterated the emperor's wishes that surrender was not an option, so Hu Zongxian made a show of receiving Xu Hai's surrender while waiting for the opportune moment to strike.

He grew increasingly recalcitrant, refusing an invitation to an official Mid-Autumn party and even killing an envoy from Hu Zongxian. In late September, reinforcements from Baojing and Yongshun arrived and began small-scale skirmishes around the Shen Family Estate.

"Canada defines a small business as one with fewer than 100 paid employees and a medium-sized business as one with at least 100 and fewer than 500 employees.  As of December 2012, there were 1,107,540 employer businesses in Canada, of which 1,087,803 were small. Small businesses make up 98.2 percent of employer businesses, medium-sized businesses make up 1.6 percent of employer businesses and large businesses make up 0.1 percent of employer businesses. In 2012, over 7.7 million employees, or 69.7 percent of the total private labour force, worked for small businesses and 2.2 million employees, or 20.2 percent of the labour force, worked for medium-sized businesses. In total, SMEs employed about 10 million individuals, or 89.9 percent of employees. Canadian high-growth firms are present in every economic sector and are not just concentrated in knowledge-based industries. In terms of employment, the highest concentrations of high-growth firms in Canada during the 2006-2009 period were in construction (4.9 percent of all firms); business, building and other support services (4.6 percent); and professional, scientific and technical services (4.5 percent). In 2011, only 10.4 percent of SMEs exported.

"Census tract 0038.00 of the 2006 Canadian census covers Kensington Market. In the time between these censuses, the population of Kensington Market grew by 1.08% from being 3,740 in 2006 to rising to 4,029 in 2011 (Census 2006, Census 2011). The 2006 Canadian census revealed that the average family income in Kensington was $61,339, compared to the City of Toronto which has an average family income of $96,602.00. The 2006 Canadian census also revealed that the average income for individuals was $23, 335, whereas in 2011 with a GNR% of 29.4%, the average individual income was $26, 403. This is relatively low in comparison to the average individual income calculated for Ontario, being $38,099 in 2006, and in 2011 with a GNR% of 27.1% the Ontarian average income was $42,264 (Census 2006, Census 2011). In addition, 71.6% of the population of this census tract earned under $50,000 (Census 2006) in 2006. This is comparable to the 78.2% of the population that earned under $50,000 (Census 2011) in the following census year i.e. 2011. It is noteworthy that a shocking 22.8% of the census tract population earned under $10,000 in 2006 (Census 2006) which increased to 27.4% in 2011 (Census 2011).",12169591c83757f327d6278639a572da,By how many dollars did the average individual income in Ontario raise between 2006 and 2011?,4165,-38073.0,nabert,d0086f4dc47d1ce4c4bde7ad5b74c614,By how many dollars did the average individual income in Ontario raise between 2006 and 2011?,4165,37696,naqanet,397ddd4471a6ffb606788517b6f26698,By how many dollars did the average individual income raise between 2006 and 2011?,3068,-38076.0,nabert,1cee366a3ccbddd9035a1c9911539faf,By how many dollars did the average individual income raise between 2006 and 2011?,3068,-403,naqanet,45c5de9cfd8135aa63d0234ef4a47017,How many dollars to an individual income increase from 2006 to 2011?,3,-34070.0,nabert,4b66daae5c7f2eee251bb924ad46b323,How many dollars to an individual income increase from 2006 to 2011?,3,0,naqanet,7c5ff263e30b2729d4e40de47c127467,How many more dollars did  Toronto average family income make than Kensington?,35263,-61339,naqanet,a12ecbb527bbfb1d1d1ac6e2273f28e4,How many more dollars was the average family income in Toronto than Kensington?,35263,-61339,naqanet,483e90d03cd9159d82d4862374e05830,"How many more percentage points of the population earned under $50,000 in 2011 thanearned under $10000 in 2011?",50.8,-6.6000000000000085,nabert,3d412d309fb972c693220600656768b9,"How many more percentage points of the population earned under $50,000 in 2011 thanearned under $10000 in 2011?",50.8,2,naqanet,91712c3e77e709f6f028918ee34ebcb7,"Which city in Canada has the least average family income, Toronto or Kensington?",Kensington,toronto,nabert,7d697e48887f128a71058844555a8af7,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown Houston boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate 610 West. Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, -tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the worlds tallest skyscraper outside a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I.

"Charles reached Rome in 1265, but was temporarily halted by financial embarrassments. Manfred, however, did not take the field against him until January 1266, when Charles' main army had crossed the Alps. Alarmed by desertions among his followers and fearing further treachery, Manfred sought to bring Charles to battle as swiftly as possible. Charles attempted to turn Manfred's position at Capua by a perilous crossing of the Apennines which wrecked his supply line; but Manfred had intelligence of his move and lay in a strong position across the River Calore, crossed only by one bridge. Charles had divided his cavalry into three ""battles"". The infantry and the first battle, consisting of 900 Provençals were at the front, commanded by Marshal of France Hugh of Mirepoix and Philip of Montfort, Lord of Castres. Behind them were the second battle, which consisted of 400 Italians and 1,000 men of Languedoc and central France. Charles commanded the second battle in person. Behind them, the third battle consisted of about 700 men from the county of Flanders under Constable of France Gilles II de Trasignies and Robert III of Flanders. Manfred had adopted similar dispositions. His Saracen archers were in the fore. Behind them was the first battle, 1,200 German mercenaries armed in coats of plates, commanded by his cousin Giordano d'Anglano and Galvano of Anglona. The second battle consisted of the Italian mercenaries, about 1,000, and 300 Saracen light horse, commanded by his uncle Galvano Lancia. The third battle, numbering 1,400, were the feudatories of the Kingdom, under Manfred's personal command.",4bc88348c1a7dd3703fefce6a7d2cb61,How many German mercenaries and Italian mercenaries were part of Manfred's battles?,2200,1500.0,nabert,8443cfa0c0d274640b36560be1fca573,How many men in all made up Charles' cavalry?,3000,1000,naqanet,1695fe4c24dd0afbc93fc6d82c81887d,How many men were in the first battle of Manfred?,1200,1600.0,nabert,13bc081984dceafa4fed8fd8d3c02f5b,How many men were in the first battle of Manfred?,1200,900,naqanet,ee8c3588f3bce8d63681bb0a518828e0,How many more men were Charle's second battle than the third?,700,300.0,nabert,ed627b304b86094d9a11287cf7cb2713,How many more men were part of Charles first battle compared to Charles third battle?,200,0.0,nabert,48f4faa53008b5eec71f82386b28a656,How many more men were part of Charles first battle compared to Charles third battle?,200,700,naqanet,9ae8dd7141e1ca582d9214fa019a1a98,How many total Italians fought from both sides?,1400,800.0,nabert,c0a4ea349d6551dd6d93b3d6e8ccb855,"How many total men did Charles have in his sceond ""battle""?",1400,1100.0,nabert,c116b8c3f07342006373d0691fe6a58e,"How many total men did Charles have in his sceond ""battle""?",1400,1600,naqanet,586ca66815a5e8d1be6c49fdbeb7118e,How many total men made up Charles second battle?,1400,1800.0,nabert,55276ac0831170ac44589d85bc6e56c4,"Which battle did Charles command in person, first, second or third?",second,"first , second",nabert,e38ced2d9ef39620b0753ceb62565e65,"Which battle in Charles cavalry had two hundred man less than the first battle, the second battle or the third battle?",third battle,the second battle,nabert,d47687b6ed98eeba6f1c406a6c1a0132,"Which battle in Charles cavalry had two hundred man less than the first battle, the second battle or the third battle?",third battle,the second battle or the third battle,naqanet,0de4eb3e5dce3a40bcaf7b61bdfd5c9f,"Which were there more of in the second battle, Italians or men of Languedoc?",men of Languedoc,Italians,naqanet,ae3d4f69b6372451d5af1efd1e7df61c,"Who commanded the first battle, France Hugh, Philip of Montfort or Charles?",France Hugh,Philip of Montfort,naqanet,115f7ed1860f8f5e72d1eebe410794d5,"Who commanded the first battle, France Hugh, Philip of Montfort or Charles?",France Hugh,hugh,nabert,4923cd6804b2eda527f67de81a1c5e8d,Who was in the infantry?,900 Provençals,900 provencals,nabert,daae9a707135cd918797c35099a631ca,Who was in the infantry?,900 Provençals,Manfred,naqanet,af3d133d1992b9369f2af6ee3190a7bd,Why did Charles stop advancing?,financial embarrassments,"temporarily halted by financial embarrassments.

"China is the second largest trading partner of Nepal. In 2015/16, total exports to China stood at US$181 million with marginal increase from US$179 million in the previous fiscal year. In contrast, import from China has been growing at the rate of 39 per cent per year. It rose from US$421 million in fiscal year 2009/10 to US$1,247 million in fiscal year 2015/16. As a result, the trade deficit with China has risen from US$401 million in 2009/10 to US$1228 million in 2015/16. Although, China has given zero tariff entry facility to over 8000 Nepali products starting from 2009, Nepal hasn’t been able to bring the trade deficit down. Nepal exports 370 products including noodles and agro products to China. Nepal regularly participates various trade fairs and exhibitions organized in China.

"Clad in all-blue uniforms for the first time in franchise history, Ron Dayne rushed for a career-high 153 yards and two touchdowns and Kris Brown kicked the winning 48-yard field goal as time expired to shock the Colts 27-24. The Texans used Dayne and rookie Chris Taylor to eat up the clock and exploit the Colts' suspect run defense, ranked last in the NFL, while taking pressure off David Carr and the struggling passing game. The win broke a nine-game losing streak to the Colts (11-4). It would be the Colts' last defeat before winning Super Bowl XLI. Mario Williams forced a Dominic Rhodes fumble on the Colts' second play. Anthony Weaver recovered the ball on the Indianapolis 47 and Houston would convert it into a touchdown, taking an early 14-0 lead. Houston led through most of the game until Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison connected for their second touchdown, a 7-yard pass that tied it 24-24 with 2:41 remaining. Carr and the Texans then engineered a six-play, 31-yard drive that ended with Brown's winning kick.

"Coming off a bye week, the Bears battled rival Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football. The team kept the Lions from scoring until the fourth quarter, and forced four takeaways. The first turnover forced was in the first half, when Lance Briggs stripped the ball from Mikel Leshoure, which was recovered by Julius Peppers. The second and third turnovers were forced in the third quarter on Zack Bowman's muffed punt recovery, and Brian Urlacher recovering Joique Bell's fumble. The final turnover occurred when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford's pass was intercepted by D. J. Moore. The Bears struck first on Jay Cutler's touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, and Robbie Gould kicked a field goal to increase the first half score to 10-0. During the game, Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh threw Cutler to the ground, injuring his ribs. Cutler was eventually replaced by Jason Campbell for a play, before returning to the game. In the second half, Gould kicked another field goal, and prevented the Lions from scoring until the final 36 seconds of the game, when Stafford threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Broyles to narrow the margin to six points, but the Bears sealed the victory by recovering the ensuring onside kick.",4eab732e26e23416d689dff28d781a80,How many points did the Bears score in the second half?,3,0,naqanet,79034c8cdf4f6d98c303769a6a0cd1ba,How many points did the Bears score in the second half?,3,10,nabert,66384505ae056b634713c0a0b791baaa,How many quarters did the Lions play before scoring any points?,3,2,naqanet,c6cc9421b3434ffa585be6998636981c,Which team scored first?,Bears,Lions,naqanet,e829ac47948b8f59d86fc32e6db55e45,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Coming off a week 2 loss, the Ravens were determined to bounce back and fight hard. On their second offensive play from scrimmage, Flacco threw a 74-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Torrey Smith. It was the first catch of Smith's career and the longest pass of Flacco's career. Before the first quarter was up, Flacco would throw two more touchdown passes to Smith for 41 and 18 yards respectively, marking the 12th time in NFL history that any receiver caught three touchdown passes in a single quarter, and the first time ever for a rookie.

"Coming off their home win over the Bengals, the Vikings flew to Bank of America Stadium to face the Carolina Panthers in a Week 15 Sunday Night duel. The Vikings clinched the NFC North about an hour before the game thanks in part to Pittsburgh's 37-36 last-second win over the Packers. With a win, the Vikings would be one game behind New Orleans to clinch homefield advantage. After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina got on the board with quarterback Matt Moore finding fullback Brad Hoover on a 1-yard TD pass. The extra point attempt was blocked, however. The Vikings then took the lead later in the quarter with running back Adrian Peterson's 4-yard TD run.

"Concerned by the Burmese consolidation of Shan states and Laotian states, China launched four invasions of Burma between 1765 and 1769. At first, the Qianlong Emperor envisaged an easy war, and sent in only the Green Standard troops stationed in Yunnan. The Qing invasion came as the majority of Burmese forces were deployed in their latest invasion of Siam. Nonetheless, battle-hardened Burmese troops defeated the first two invasions of 1765-1766 and 1766-1767 at the border. The regional conflict now escalated to a major war that involved military manoeuvres nationwide in both countries. The third invasion  led by the elite Manchu Bannermen nearly succeeded, penetrating deep into central Burma within a few days' march from Ava. But the Bannermen of northern China could not cope with unfamiliar tropical terrains and lethal endemic diseases, and were driven back with heavy losses. After the close-call, Hsinbyushin redeployed his armies from Siam to the Chinese front. The fourth and largest invasion got bogged down at the frontier. With the Qing forces completely encircled, a truce was reached between the field commanders of the two sides in December 1769.",6185f3c36d874180751aef9ea718c4d8,After how many Chinese invasions did the conflict escalate from a regional conflict into a major war?,2,1,nabert,ede4310fd75a56b274f0c16e51091840,After how many Chinese invasions did the conflict escalate from a regional conflict into a major war?,2,3,naqanet,fd8c6821cf936f6ffef351141b4489df,How many years did the second invasion of the Burmese Troops  1766-1767 last?,1,2,naqanet,b629d7fa7e051ed6acce52a334e75d68,When did the last invasion happen?,1769,1767,naqanet,42e342c65dc5ef7ba6c6c5c4175238e1,When was the first invasion by China?,1765,0,naqanet,d2f50a7cc9e974a7af0679e9aeacb342,When was the last invasion by China?,1769,0,naqanet,b0d3ae2370f607e4630249bb3ae877af,Which Chinese invasion got the furthest into Burma?,The third invasion,"China launched four invasions of Burma between 1765 and 1769.

"Cooper was selected to represent the US at the inaugural Goodwill games, held in Moscow in July 1986. North Carolina States Kay Yow served as head coach. The team opened up with a 72–53 win over Yugoslavia, and followed that with a 21-point win over Brazil 91–70.  The third game was against Czechoslovakia and would be much closer. Cheryl Miller was the scoring leader in this game, scoring 26 points to help the US to a 78–70 victory.  The US faced Bulgaria in the semi-final match up, and again won, this time 67–58.

"Cosmetic surgery is a voluntary or elective surgery that is performed on normal parts of the body with the only purpose of improving a person’s appearance and/or removing signs of aging. In 2014, nearly 16 million cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled since the start of the century. 92% of cosmetic procedures were performed on women in 2014, up from 88% in 2001. Nearly 12 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2007, with the five most common surgeries being breast augmentation, liposuction, breast reduction, eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for 34 different cosmetic procedures. Nineteen of the procedures are surgical, such as rhinoplasty or facelift. The nonsurgical procedures include Botox and laser hair removal. In 2010, their survey revealed that there were 9,336,814 total procedures in the United States. Of those, 1,622,290 procedures were surgical. They also found that a large majority, 81%, of the procedures were done on Caucasian people. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) estimates that more than 333,000 cosmetic procedures were performed on patients 18 years of age or younger in the US in 2005 compared to approx. 14,000 in 1996. This is significant because it encourages younger people to continue these procedures later in life. The increased use of cosmetic procedures crosses ethnic plastic surgery in the U.S., with increases seen among African-Americans, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans as well as Caucasian Americans. In Europe, the second largest market for cosmetic procedures, cosmetic surgery is a $2.2 billion business. Of 1191 UK newspaper articles, 89% used the term 'plastic surgery' in the context of cosmetic surgery.",c59b8dcd529c183a0e969e2f398bdb9f,How many cosmetic procedures were performed on people of a race other than Caucasian?,19,-65.0,nabert,086ca91de7990c9a485b2a9a2babba26,How many cosmetic procedures were performed on people of a race other than Caucasian?,19,2,naqanet,ee7af9bcdd7a54a4bf1bd4deaae3b48d,How many more cosmetic procedures were performed on patients younger than 18 in 2014 than 2005?,319000,-332984.0,nabert,6501d60eef97da77ea45c866f050c662,How many more cosmetic procedures were performed on patients younger than 18 in 2014 than 2005?,319000,332908,naqanet,e4fcc6e21af3e032aa38db14a8c8aa18,How many more million cosmetic procedures were done in 2014 than in 2007?,4,-4,naqanet,694cdf76147fb0af409d1473d47c22a8,How many more people under the age of 18 had cosmetic procedures in 2005 than in 1996?,319000,-92,naqanet,1b784d07eaeac61b54fee0540ca0fe6b,How many more than the top five procedures does the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for?,29,-34,naqanet,aa4efd0d8ea68fb12f8b845616752a5d,How many more than the top five procedures does the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for?,29,15.0,nabert,9d53071b65b255ed3ab7979d52d1e869,How many of the five most common procedures are not done on the breasts?,3,4,nabert,69ffeeff0a84fa4e8335b9de50fae03a,How many of the five most common procedures are not done on the breasts?,3,76,naqanet,52364b090ce8549ec67331a1c893bbc1,How many of the procedures performed in 2010 were nonsurgical?,7714524,9336814,naqanet,4901844465a4cea4412e108e576c0d8f,How many of the total procedures done in 2010 were non-surgical?,7714524,10959104,naqanet,bc736c304dbbc9606b3dd8501a261fb1,How many percent of cosmetic procedures in 2014 were not performed on women?,8,80,naqanet,bee74bf0da9301e1696585b5a07ee0eb,How many procedures which the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery keeps statistic for are nonsurgical?,15,2,nabert,39bf70385c8d964103aeaa54f39ab05b,How many procedures which the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery keeps statistic for are nonsurgical?,15,34,naqanet,d7125eb171df0c26a9b4ae77c3d24b4b,"In 2010, in percent, how many procedures were done on those not classified as Caucasian?",19,0,naqanet,d584726f89aaabc111928226a36d163a,"In percent, how many cosmetic procedures were performed on men in 2001?",12,88,naqanet,577f8238ae3162dd71a79d6e72fada56,Which of the most common procedures are not done on the breasts?,liposuction eyelid surgery abdominoplasty,"liposuction , breast reduction , eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty",nabert,bbaad671ed43871b91062d26f334a698,Which of the most common procedures are not done on the breasts?,liposuction eyelid surgery abdominoplasty,surgical,naqanet,cffcd5136fce6d764eddd852e1fde822,none,none,none,none,none
"Couceiro had undertaken a first incursion in 1911 with about 1,000 men, who had formed in groups of 60-70 men. They had left the town of Verín, 12 kilometers from the northern border with Spain, and had marched towards the border. Most of the men were from the region of Trás-os-Montes and were from a diverse array of social classes and skills. There were more than 100 priests in the group. In terms of military equipment, there were only 400 ancient rifles, a few Winchester rifles, and Mauser Pocket Pistols adapted to rifles, to which were added a score of semi-automatic pistols, daggers, and swords. The 1,000 men had crossed the border after a long march in the mountainous region between Bragança and Vinhais, near the present-day Montesinhos National Park. The republican garrison in Bragança had waited for an attack that never came. This is because the royalists had changed their plans and now marched on Vinhais, which had a smaller garrison of men—only eighty infantry, cavalry and border guards. These forces from Vinhais had left the small town and had concentrated on a hill nearby. Negotiations were begun but the military commander of Vinhais refused to join or to surrender.

"Danish officials appealed for help to French colonists at Martinique, located 324 miles away. Two French ships arrived from there to St. John on April 23, 1734, carrying several hundred French and Swiss troops to try to take control from the rebels. With their firepower and troops, by mid-May they had restored planters' rule of the island. The French ships returned to Martinique on June 1, leaving the local militia to track down the remaining rebels, which they did over the next three months. The slave insurrection was considered ended on August 25, 1734 when Sergeant Øttingen captured the remaining maroon rebels. The loss of life and property from the insurrection caused many St. John landowners to move to St. Croix, a nearby island bought by the Danish from the French in 1733. Four ships carried planters and their families from Charlotte Amalie in August. While they found St. Croix to be a richer land, they had to have their slaves clear jungle before being able to live there readily.",14287a585fa77128977f9ee2b252cf4f,How many days were the French troops away from Martinique?,38,22,naqanet,8a6fd9f75b516c4bd9b6c65f34e9a64e,How many days were the French troops away from Martinique?,38,24.0,nabert,864eee1349944d30319bc2df99901881,What day did two french ships arrive at St. John?,April 23,1757,naqanet,5fd458bd1745a77661f38f4ea3cc2678,What day did two french ships arrive at St. John?,April 23,april,nabert,f5464f44ed236ceb1c33b86f03668ddb,What kind of people were on the ships that arrived at St. Croix in August?,planters and their families,Danish officials appealed for help to French,naqanet,c84fb7b5f39d09cad6fddee87c8210bf,What kind of people were on the ships that arrived at St. Croix in August?,planters and their families,planters,nabert,db2faf1242290d46498c7c8fb626303e,When did the event end that caused many St. John landowners to move to St. Croix?,August 25 1734,1733,naqanet,48bbdb30940c4d855472ebe070eecfb3,When did the event end that caused many St. John landowners to move to St. Croix?,August 25 1734,1734,nabert,f2e86c296f21a35df64ddc42a7c0777f,When did two french ships arrive at St. John?,April 23 1734,1734,naqanet,e8ffcedf1cebd7528c8835737d7030d0,When did two french ships arrive at St. John?,April 23 1734,april,nabert,eb85d1042b81c0a545172b7f98e21dce,"Who did the Swiss allied with to capture St. John from the rebels control, the French or the Dutch?",French,Dutch,naqanet,4563d7d26ea6b8e3d31d9ea3b980203a,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Discovery of gold in the Boise Basin in 1862 brought settlement to the region again.  The lower Boise River was fully contained within Boise County from 1863 until the formation of Ada in 1864. Settlement of the lower Boise River west of Boise City was limited prior to the completion of the Oregon Shortline railroad.  Middleton was the first settlement of Canyon County, starting in 1863. The 1870 Census for Ada County listed 76 residents of the Boise Valley, excluding Boise City and the 1880 Census listed 44 residents at Middleton.  The arrival of the Railroad at Caldwell led to the establishment of a town there as of August, 1883.  Businessmen James A. McGee and Alexander Duffes filed the plat for nearby Nampa in 1886.  Parma was settled around the same time with the Old Fort Boise post office being moved to the towns location.  It was incorporated in 1904.  Ada County established precincts for each of the settlements with a combined 1890 Census population of 2,311.  Significant settlement of Greenleaf and Notus started around 1904 with the two settlements listed as precincts at the 1910 census.  Notus was incorporated in 1921 while Greenleaf was incorporated prior to 1980.  Melba was incorporated in 1912 while Wilder was incorporated in 1919.

"During the 1970s the oil shocks (1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis) hit Iceland hard. Inflation rose to 43% in 1974 and 59% in 1980, falling to 15% in 1987 but rising to 30% in 1988. Iceland experienced moderately strong GDP growth (3% on average) from 1995 to 2004. Growth slowed between 2000 and 2002, but the economy expanded by 4.3% in 2003 and grew by 6.2% in 2004. Growth in 2005 exceeded 6%. Inflation averaged merely 1.5% from 1993 to 1994, and only 1.7% from 1994 to 1995. Inflation over 2006 topped at 8.6%, with a rate of 6.9% as of January 2007. Standard & Poors reduced their rating for Iceland to AA- from A+ (long term) in December 2006, following a loosening of fiscal policy by the Icelandic government ahead of the 2007 elections. Foreign debt rose to more than five times the value of Icelands GDP, and Icelands Central Bank raised short-term interest rates to nearly 15% in 2007.

"During the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain, fearing that French control of the Netherlands might deliver Sri Lanka to the French, occupied the coastal areas of the island  with little difficulty in 1796. In 1802, the Treaty of Amiens formally ceded the Dutch part of the island to Britain and it became a crown colony. In 1803, the British invaded the Kingdom of Kandy in the first Kandyan War, but were repulsed. In 1815 Kandy was occupied in the second Kandyan War, finally ending Sri Lankan independence. Following the suppression of the Uva Rebellion the Kandyan peasantry were stripped of their lands by the Wastelands Ordinance, a modern enclosure movement, and reduced to penury. The British found that the uplands of Sri Lanka were very suitable for coffee, tea and rubber cultivation. By the mid-19th century, Ceylon tea had become a staple of the British market bringing great wealth to a small number of white tea planters. The planters imported large numbers of Tamil workers as indentured labourers from south India to work the estates, who soon made up 10% of the island's population.

"During the early reign of the Yongle Emperor, the territorial princes were restored of their positions. However, they were relocated away from the frontiers, and gradually stripped of their military power. With the subsequent policies enforced by the Yongle Emperor, the emperor was successful in consolidating the power of the central government. In 1426, the Xuande Emperor managed to force all of the territorial princes to renounce their remaining personal army after suppressing the rebellion of Zhu Gaoxu. The Yongle Emperor began the preparation for relocating the imperial capital to Beiping in 1403, a process that lasted throughout his entire reign. The construction of the future Forbidden City along with the restructuring of the Grand Canal were constantly ongoing. In 1420, the reconstruction of Beiping City was completed, and the Ming Dynasty officially relocated the imperial capital to Beiping and renamed the city to Beijing.

"Estimates vary about the number and quality of financial jobs in the city. One estimate was that Wall Street firms employed close to 200,000 persons in 2008. Another estimate was that in 2007, the financial services industry which had a $70 billion profit became 22 percent of the citys revenue. Another estimate (in 2006) was that the financial services industry makes up 9% of the citys work force and 31% of the tax base. An additional estimate (2007) from Steve Malanga of the Manhattan Institute was that the securities industry accounts for 4.7 percent of the jobs in New York City but 20.7 percent of its wages, and he estimated there were 175,000 securities-industries jobs in New York (both Wall Street area and midtown) paying an average of $350,000 annually. Between 1995 and 2005, the sector grew at an annual rate of about 6.6% annually, a respectable rate, but that other financial centers were growing faster. Another estimate (2008) was that Wall Street provided a fourth of all personal income earned in the city, and 10% of New York Citys tax revenue.  The citys securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the citys financial sector and an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the citys tax revenue, and 22 percent of the citys total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700.",829865eb34155b1cd2224d3dfbff683d,"How many, in percent, of jobs in New York City are not in the securities industry?",95.3,0,naqanet,00d578d70c4cb9a8070b4ebcd33a6a76,"How many, in percent, of the citys total wages are not from the securities industry?",78,0,naqanet,720dc5b46958ec0c43a7df30f067c6ac,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Eta Carinae was brighter still on January 2, 1838, equivalent to Alpha Centauri, before fading slightly over the following three months. Herschel did not observe the star after this, but received correspondence from the Reverend W.S. Mackay in Calcutta, who wrote in 1843, ""To my great surprise I observed this March last (1843), that the star Eta Argus had become a star of the first magnitude fully as bright as Canopus, and in colour and size very like Arcturus."" Observations at the Cape of Good Hope indicated it peaked in brightness, surpassing Canopus, over March 11 to 14, 1843 before beginning to fade, then brightened to between the brightness of Alpha Centauri and Canopus between March 24 and 28 before fading once again. For much of 1844 the brightness was midway between Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri, around magnitude +0.2, before brightening again at the end of the year. At its brightest in 1843 it likely reached an apparent magnitude of −0.8, then −1.0 in 1845. The peaks in 1827, 1838, and 1843 are likely to have occurred at the periastron passage—the point the two stars are closest together—of the Binary star orbit. From 1845 to 1856, the brightness decreased by around 0.1 magnitudes per year, but with possible rapid and large fluctuations.",8a4a341d10f8bf44a1a6708a34fd7619,How many days did Eta Carinae surpass Canopus in brightness?,3,17.0,nabert,e30a00adacab95f27c9235fd5b55931d,How many years apart was the first peak of brightness from the very last peak of brightness?,16,11,naqanet,c3277ece3b483e0c8e0ca7a446e137b8,How many years apart was the first peak of brightness from the very last peak of brightness?,16,2.0,nabert,0726338e7d0764ccb656b8f4ed9607d6,"Which lasted less, when Eta Carinae peaked in brightness or when it brightened to between the brightness of Alpha Centauri and Canopus?",peaked in brightness,eta carinae peaked,nabert,96ea245bc12fd081d81b7d51e44c6bf7,"Which lasted less, when Eta Carinae peaked in brightness or when it brightened to between the brightness of Alpha Centauri and Canopus?",peaked in brightness,when it brightened to between the brightness of Alpha Centauri,naqanet,d51f406f7b74a233ec50014abbdd7d99,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Ewbank, Martin, Maynard, and Namath are recognized based upon their achievements with the Jets. Ewbank is also recognized based upon his achievements with the Baltimore Colts, coaching them to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959. Riggins is recognized primarily for his seasons with the Washington Redskins (1976-1979, 1981-1985), as is Monk (1980-1993), who won three Super Bowl championships with Washington. Lott is in the Hall of Fame primarily for his exploits as a member of the San Francisco 49ers. Baugh and Turner are recognized based upon their achievements as players with other teams, rather than their head coaching stints with the Jets. While Parcells reversed the fortunes of the Jets, he had major impact for the New York Giants, coaching them to two Super Bowl victories. Wolf only had a brief stint with the Jets between 1990 and 1991, while most of his major contributions occurred as an executive and player personnel director with the Oakland Raiders (1963-1974, 1979-1989), and later as General Manager of the Green Bay Packers (1991-2001). Favre only played one season as a member of the Jets in 2008, between most of his career with the Packers (1992-2007) and his last two NFL seasons with the Minnesota Vikings (2009-2010).",8b7542ba56a9eddaa8f8c87ecda43248,"Which period was was Wolf executive and player personnel director with the Oakland Raiders longer for, 1963-1974 or 1979-1989 ?",1963-1974,1979 - 1989,nabert,816edeeb1109fe34188276b84e7fd5fe,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Fighting continued throughout the winter between the KDP and PUK. Complicating matters, PKK was present in Iraq. PKK was allied with the PUK which later led KDP attack the PKK. According to some sources, the PKK began to fight against all who supported KDP, including some Assyrian and Arab groups. Turkey which saw the Kurdish Civil war as an opportunity, allied with KDP and launched Operation Hammer in May, in a violent attempt to force the PKK to leave Iraqi Kurdistan. This operation caused heavy PKK casualties but was unsuccessful. PKK succeeded to keep their camps in Northern Iraq. On 25 September 1997, Turkish forces re-entered Iraqi Kurdistan and attacked PUK and PKK positions in an attempt to force the PKK to leave Iraqi Kurdistan. However, according to Turkish sources, it was an attempt to bring a cease-fire between the factions. The operation resulted in heavy PKK and PUK casualties. Later a cease-fire was negotiated between the PUK and KDP after the US decision to support a cease-fire. Despite the cease-fire, renewed fighting broke out along the armistice line between the KDP and PUK in October and November. In this round of fighting, 1,200 combatants were killed on both sides and 10,000 civilians fled their homes. On 24 November 1997, the KDP declared a unilateral cease-fire.

"Following World War II, Britain retained control of both British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland as protectorates. In 1950, as a result of the Paris Peace Treaties, the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition—first proposed by the Somali Youth League  and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali  and the Somali National League —that Somalia achieve independence within ten years. British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960. In 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis, the British returned the Haud  and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British, French and Italians agreed upon the territorial boundaries of Ethiopia with the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against raids by hostile clans. Britain included the provision that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over. Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District  to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic.",f60e965c559d6a9991734f606035583a,British returned the Haud and the Ogaden to Ethiopia how many before they tried to buy it back?,8,2,naqanet,f76d61a3a3f1aa59c54267bf57ddef2d,How many years after returning the Haud and the Ogaden to Ethiopia did the British try to buy them back?,8,-1897,naqanet,f43c9572542468e233a2b2850dd2c906,How many years after the British returned the Haud an the Ogaden to Ethiopia did Brtain unsuccessfully bid to buy back Somali lands it had turned over?,8,59,naqanet,d82417c895f5fa1b271a9715a0f50741,How many years after the British returned the Haud and the Ogaden to Ethiopia did British Somaliland remain a protectorate of Britain?,12,63,naqanet,22d630c1a9d1f6bdc0e3ff69ccfdde37,How many years did it take Somalia to achieve independence?,10,1950.0,nabert,1f2e2ae65714f6a4bfdfa75995ec2469,In what year did Somaliland achieve independence?,1960,-10,naqanet,da024be4ac03c683c824b0ddd53fcc99,In what year did Somaliland achieve independence?,1960,1970.0,nabert,021d8e6066d9066a2286a2baa02e329b,Which Somali political organizations proposed the independence clause?,Somali Youth League Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali Somali National League,"Somali Youth League  and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali",naqanet,bd7efe77c15af0bc57e012cdbd022ceb,Which Somali political organizations proposed the independence clause?,Somali Youth League Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali Somali National League,somali youth league,nabert,1af4021badd688355070aa00b18018e5,Which condition was set so that Italy had control of Somaliland?,independence within ten years,Paris Peace Treaties,naqanet,1c102a1269d27036eef5eb2326ffceb2,Which condition was set so that Italy had control of Somaliland?,independence within ten years,"italy trusteeship of italian somaliland , but only under close supervision",nabert,6a8eb80e3a36effd6a31ba2b10c5e941,Which country's nationalists gained control of the Northern Frontier district?,Kenyan,Britain,naqanet,4546acf40a377b0dd96d7af85647106a,Who decided on Ethiopian territorial boundaries?,"British, French and Italians",British,naqanet,86804d5d6bf29f6cb125c0438a404a54,Who decided on Ethiopian territorial boundaries?,"British, French and Italians",french and italians,nabert,903b996b4ed2129d0a50c01492eff5a7,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Following an impressive win over the Panthers, the Texans went home for an AFC South duel with the defending Super Bowl champions, the Indianapolis Colts (who Houston won against last time at home).  In the first quarter, the Texans delivered the first punch with WR Jerome Mathis returning a kickoff 84 yards for a touchdown.  However, the Colts responded with QB Peyton Manning completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark.  In the second quarter, Houston retook the lead with kicker Kris Brown getting a 33-yard field goal.  However, Indianapolis went ahead with RB Joseph Addais 4-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Colts managed to put the Texans in a huge hole with kicker Adam Vinatieri's 36-yard field goal, Addai's 8-yard TD run, and Vinatieri's 28-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Houston tried a comeback with RB Samkon Gado's 1-yard TD run.  Indianapolis would get their final score of the game with Vinatieri kicking a 35-yard field goal.  The Texans drew close with QB Matt Schaub's 1-yard TD pass to RB Vonta Leach.

"Following their defeat at Stamford Bridge, the Percy brothers were arraigned before a commission of Oyer and Terminer at York. This commission bound them over for massive sums; 8,000 marks payable to Salisbury, and including fines towards his countess and sons, to a total of 16,800 marks; Griffiths describes this as Salisbury's 'reckoning' of all the damage caused him estates during the course of the feud.Griffiths has summarised the financial bonds that were intended to hold the peace together. Salisbury entered into a bond with the king for 12,000 marks on behalf of his sons Thomas and John . Conversely, Northumberland and his mother bound themselves for the same amount, ‘for all offences' against York and the Nevilles. Salisbury also agreed that Lord Egremont was to be released from the 16,800 mark bond he had been punished with in November 1454, and would also desist from taking any action against the Newgate sheriffs responsible for Egremont's escape.  Egremont himself was then obligated in bond for 4,000 marks. This would have to be paid to Salisbury if he broke the peace towards the earl and his family for the next ten years. As Griffiths put, with these bonds, it was intended that ‘the slate was wiped clean.'",002ab01907ff5e3a000d3ff6f2d55a41,How many more marks was Lord Egremont bound for than the Percy brothers?,4000,12800.0,nabert,545618dc0ea8d817a1dfcfd4a38f6e1b,How many more marks was Lord Egremont bound for than the Percy brothers?,4000,8800,naqanet,88c9f335668f9852d83e5c38f517b7b4,How much money did the Percy brothers owe?,"16,800 marks",168000.0,nabert,c4bfccd7bab270f03f9328b5b2f4771b,How much money did the Percy brothers owe?,"16,800 marks",commission of Oyer,naqanet,22f4e42a6c09ed32de313d9d26045eaa,"Which Lord was to be released from the 16,800 mark bond?",Lord Egremont,Thomas and John,naqanet,4a4ff1a3e3f8ac1b809ded2c34d5cc69,Who had the least marks on them?,Egremont,family,naqanet,7eaf406fc691bd89852d7ab05127085e,Who had the least marks on them?,Egremont,lord egremont,nabert,c8a4e9cf7f4b9e5b458b4ff8c81c5296,Who let Lord Egremont out of his debt?,Salisbury,Newgate sheriffs,naqanet,cabeea11e5df262061d97977c8b7fcff,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Following their second loss to the Giants, the Cowboys returned to Arlington in a match against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (who were coming off a five-game winning streak). Despite both teams sharing the lead from time and time again, the Cowboys were able to hold off the Buccaneers. With less than a minute remaining in the fourth quarter, Orlando Scandrick intercepted a pass from Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston (who fumbled earlier in the first half) and ended the game as a Cowboys victory. Dallas' only other highlight came early in the second quarter when Ezekiel Elliott leapt onto the Salvation Army kettle after scoring a touchdown to lead Dallas 10-3. This celebration resulted in a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty; however, the following day, the NFL decided to not fine Elliott for the celebration.

"Following this victory, Edward realized that to create a force capable of retaking Jerusalem it would be necessary to end the internal unrest within the Christian state, and so he mediated between Hugh and his unenthusiastic knights from the Ibelin family of Cyprus.  In parallel to the mediation, Prince Edward and King Hugh began negotiating a truce with Sultan Baibars; a 10-year-10-month-and-10-day agreement was reached in May 1272, at Caesarea. Almost immediately Prince Edmund departed for England, while Edward remained to see if the treaty would hold. The following month, an attempt to assassinate Edward was made.

"For each vintage, the CIVC rated the villages of the area based on the quality of their grapes and vineyards. The rating was then used to determine the price and the percentage of the price that growers get. The Grand Cru rated vineyards received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to 100% of the price. Premier Crus were vineyards with 90–99% ratings while Deuxième Crus received 80–89% ratings. Under appellation rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) of grapes can be pressed (wine) to create up to 673 gallons (US) (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée and the next 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine is a blend of vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its Lees (fermentation), but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on Lees (fermentation) for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.",3cc5c34e2721d468ff09051fb58475e6,How many more higher percentage ratings did Premier Crus recieve than Deuxième Crus?,10,0,naqanet,0fdfc03765f2d83c75f368f05e737370,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"For the Fox, the origins, and the potential solution, to resolve their conflict lay in the slave trade. The Foxes were still willing to return to the French alliance if they could secure the return of their captives.:215 In fact, all they wanted was to be considered as allies and kin, not enemies. However, the French officials supported that the Illinois, Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Huron were against the Foxes. As a result, the peace treaty from 1726 was annulled in the summer of 1727.:215 With this peace treaty being annulled, the Fox declared war to the French and all their Indian allies. For the next four years, the French invested a lot of money and descended, with their allies, on Fox villages with an extreme advantage.:216 The French pursued destruction of the Fox to such an extent as to damage their relations with other tribes. The Sioux and the Iowas refused the Fox sanctuary.:218 By the summer of 1730, the Fox population was weakening and continued to be attacked until the Sauk finally granted them sanctuary. The Sauk and Fox fought off the French with the help of western Indians, who were aware of Beauharnois plan for decimation.:219 This final push would cause Beauharnois to grant a ""General Pardon"" in 1738 and peace to be restored.:219 Their historical feuds with New France encouraged many Sauk and Fox warriors to develop kinship ties with France's rivals, the British. These ties continued to be significant as late as the War of 1812, when many Sauk and Fox fought on the side of British North America.",d520807a0e2cd6fcabb0bcf063c5dc7e,How many groups did the French officials supported were against the Foxes?,4,3,naqanet,b074d2c9382adaf99cc26d0939db83d3,How many tribes were against the Fox?,4,2,naqanet,84e8012c1f02e77e9fb750faffcd0568,How many years after peace was restored did the War of 1812 begin?,74,86,naqanet,d3515c7d99a1d65eba3c93eb2ba54262,How many years after the Peace treaty from 176 began was it annulled?,1,-1726,naqanet,172efd2f3bf8d5df1688f1570a1ec0c4,How many years after the Peace treaty from 176 began was it annulled?,1,0.0,nabert,134746722240159ba1c6d18f540fa707,"How many years after the original peace treaty was annulled was a ""General Pardon"" granted?",11,12,naqanet,e097e5d6c6ddd7075e99b223ad7e694f,How many years after the peace treat was annulled was peace restored?,11,-1726,naqanet,a9aa2a80d9112688a0fe256a51c0c81e,How many years after the peace treat was annulled was peace restored?,11,12.0,nabert,bece9596be0846820aca036bb75489bc,How many years after the peace treaty was annulled did the Sauk finally grant the Fox sanctuary?,3,-1726,naqanet,027f0b60d3169b8fff87f6066833decc,How many years after the peace treaty was annulled did the Sauk finally grant the Fox sanctuary?,3,4.0,nabert,ae97dcce9c316f89a31b5b76a9b9be32,How many years did the peace treaty in 1726 last before it was annulled 1727?,1,-1626.0,nabert,148ef63f86abd1b5f23553b514efdbf3,How many years did the peace treaty in 1726 last before it was annulled 1727?,1,-1726,naqanet,affccba6781bfc866bcf8ceea6f6003e,How many years was the 1726 peace treaty in place before it was annulled?,1,-1626.0,nabert,717cff262a7bd642759ad06512aa9aad,How many years was the 1726 peace treaty in place before it was annulled?,1,-1726,naqanet,72f007065f95fe0a85e56a2431603da8,Which tribes were against the Fox?,"Illinois, Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Huron",French,naqanet,9aacb32ad179f75c890b93cee13329d1,how many year did the peace treaty last between fox and french ?,1,12.0,nabert,fa6f31a7b1da0b08a714b813545a884a,how many year did the peace treaty last between fox and french ?,1,1726,naqanet,d04fb4da97e85f28371d6310dd3dcb1f,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"For the third straight week, the game got off to an ominous start for the Jets, as Chad Pennington was intercepted by Brian Williams on the Jets' first possession. Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run.

"For their annual Thanksgiving Day game, the Lions hosted a rematch with their divisional rival, the Minnesota Vikings. The Vikings scored 13 points in the first quarter via a one-yard touchdown pass from Case Keenum to Kyle Rudolph, and a nine-yard touchdown run from Keenum. The Lions responded with 10 points in the second quarter via a 32-yard field goal from Matt Prater and a six-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Marvin Jones Jr. The Vikings extended their lead in the second quarter via a 22-yard touchdown pass from Keenum to Rudolph to make the score 20-10 in favor of Minnesota at half-time. The Vikings opened the scoring in the second half via a two-yard touchdown run from Latavius Murray. The Lions responded with two field goals from Prater in the third quarter from 32-yards, and 50-yards, respectively. The Lions reduced the Vikings lead to four points in the fourth via a 43-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Jones. The Vikings extended their lead in the fourth quarter via a 36-yard field goal from Kai Forbath. The Lions' attempted comeback failed when Stafford's pass intended for Jones was intercepted by Xavier Rhodes. On the Vikings' ensuing drive, Forbath's 25-yard field goal attempt was blocked by Darius Slay and recovered by Nevin Lawson and returned for a 77-yard touchdown, which was then nullified due to an offside penalty on Slay, making the final score 30-23 in favor of Minnesota, snapping the Lions' three-game winning streak.",fb65e3e3d2bf1c8695ff0331aab6147e,How many points did the Lions score in the first half?,10,20,naqanet,92d3eb795bde63788a6a467a961bd0d2,How many points did the Lions score in the first half?,10,30.0,nabert,7954e5f7d3ef58c331d3a6134b21fbb3,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Franconia is named after the Franks, a Germanic tribe who conquered most of Western Europe by the middle of the 8th century. Despite its name, Franconia is not the homeland of the Franks, but rather owes its name to being partially settled by Franks from the Rhineland during the 7th century AD following the defeat of the Alamanni and Thuringians who had dominated the region earlier. At the beginning of the 10th century a Duchy of Franconia  was established within East Francia, which comprised modern Hesse, Palatinate, parts of Baden-Württemberg and most of today's Franconia. After the dissolution of the so-called Stem duchy of Franconia, the Holy Roman Emperors created the Franconian Circle  in 1500 to embrace the principalities that grew out of the eastern half of the former duchy. The territory of the Franconian Circle roughly corresponds with modern Franconia. The title of a Duke of Franconia was claimed by the Würzburg bishops until 1803 and by the kings of Bavaria until 1918. Examples of Franconian cities founded by Frankish noblemen are Würzburg, first mentioned in the 7th century, Ansbach, first mentioned in 748, and Weissenburg, founded in the 7th century.",4f7c796cf7b6f5027dea46bf19194f1f,"who become the first Duke of franconia, the Würzburg bishops or kings of Bavaria ?",Würzburg bishops until 1803,Würzburg bishops,naqanet,da1de719913b77f3dd0fbcb48f6299e7,"who become the first Duke of franconia, the Würzburg bishops or kings of Bavaria ?",Würzburg bishops until 1803,wurzburg bishops,nabert,99d30edb1701100ebdddd580a296e10b,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"From 1623 to 1624 the Dutch had been at war over the Pescadores, and in 1633 clashed with a fleet led by Zheng Zhilong in the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, ending in another Dutch defeat. By 1632 the Dutch had established a post on a peninsula named Tayoan , which was separated from the main part of Formosa by a shallow lagoon historically referred to as the Taikang inland sea . The Dutch fortifications consisted of two forts along the bay: the first and main fortification was the multiple-walled Fort Zeelandia, situated at the entrance to the bay, while the second was the smaller Fort Provintia, a walled administrative office. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan for the Dutch East India Company, was stationed in Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men, while his subordinate, Valentyn, was in charge of Fort Provintia and its garrison of 500 men. In 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, son of Zheng Zhilong and leader of the Ming loyalist remnants, felt that the Qing Empire had consolidated their position in China sufficiently, while his troops needed more supplies and manpower. He began searching for a suitable location as his base of operations, and soon a Chinese man named He Bin , who was working for the Dutch East India Company in Formosa , fled to Koxinga's base in Xiamen and provided him with a map of Taiwan.",c9604db7c10887ff9df7355f264fda7a,How many years after the end of the war over the Pescadores did the Dutch participate in the Battle of Liaoluo Bay?,9,10,naqanet,6e1267846d73456c9530e2bc81812e57,How many years before the Dutch were defeated at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay did they establish a post on the peninsula of Tayoan?,1,-1,naqanet,992bb9b09f1b40541ee04b34526c7f39,How many years passed between the beginning of the war over the Pescadores and the Battle of Liaoluo Bay?,10,1,naqanet,747b3369e61fe7788903835ec14d14cf,How many years were the Dutch at war over the Pescadores?,2,1,naqanet,f8dd90414bbfab7c7cf4cc36e09819fa,In a span of how many years were the dutch at war  over the Pescadores?,2,1,naqanet,ea311a5f11bf892ad8c77829d041f060,Which among the two forts was the multiple- walled?,Fort Zeelandia,Fort Provintia,naqanet,59d4fdb75775a8b5f5073da606c99246,Which among the two forts was the multiple- walled?,Fort Zeelandia,zeelandia,nabert,9e925c9081fa20572280576aed5278a9,"Which fort was larger, Provintia or Zeelandia?",Zeelandia,Provintia,naqanet,8523c8e3c449a12500a0f65849cb4669,Which fort was not at the entrance of the bay?,Fort Provintia,zeelandia,nabert,f05dff29b9be0111a93b7f765b560eb3,Which forts belonged to the Dutch?,Fort Zeelandia Fort Provintia,peninsula named Tayoan,naqanet,31002f3373c15d2a15e63179461f45b3,Which forts belonged to the Dutch?,Fort Zeelandia Fort Provintia,zeelandia,nabert,2cfac881df1cba8385f0d1fa6152b444,Who lost the Battle of Liaoluo Bay?,Dutch,"Dutch had been at war over the Pescadores, and in 1633 clashed with a fleet led by Zheng Zhilong",naqanet,4dac3b8505791d00439f4f1a8b596516,Who was stationed at Fort Provintia?,Valentyn,Frederick Coyett,naqanet,95d58a7f80ec3ce06313c56144868bb4,who was incharge of fort provintia?,Valentyn,"Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan for the Dutch East India Company",naqanet,54e03441e12cdd9a450bc009fbd1c1a4,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"From 1962 to 1999, women entering the U.S. workforce represented a nearly 8 percentage point increase in the overall LFPR. The U.S. overall LFPR (age 16+) has been falling since its all-time high point of 67.3% reached in January-April 2000, reaching 62.7% by January 2018. This decline since 2000 is primarily driven by the retirement of the Baby Boom generation. Since the overall labor force is defined as those age 16+, an aging society with more persons past the typical prime working age (25-54) exerts a steady downward influence on the LFPR.

"From 1975, Flavin installed permanent works in Europe and the United States, including ""Untitled. In memory of Urs Graf"" at the Kunstmuseum Basel (conceived 1972, realized 1975); the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (1977); Hudson River Museum, Yonkers, New York (1979); United States Courthouse, Anchorage, Alaska (1979-89); the Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden, Germany (1989); the lobby of the MetroTech Center (with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill), Brooklyn, New York (1992); seven lampposts outside the Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, Munich (1994); Hypovereinsbank, Munich (1995); Institut Arbeit und Technik/Wissenschaftspark, Gelsenkirchen, Germany (1996); and the Union Bank of Switzerland, Bern (1996).  Additional sites for Flavins architectural “interventions” became the Grand Central Station in New York (1976), Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin (1996), and the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas (2000). His large-scale work in colored fluorescent light for six buildings at the Chinati Foundation was initiated in the early 1980s, although the final plans were not completed until 1996. His last artwork was a site-specific art at Santa Maria Annunciata in Chiesa Rossa, Milan, Italy. The 1930s church was designed by Giovanni Muzio. The design for the piece was completed two days before Flavins death on November 29, 1996.

"From 1989 to 1993, the Pacers would play at or near .500 and qualify for the playoffs, in 1989-90 NBA season, the Pacers parlayed a fast start into the teams third playoff appearance. But the Pacers were swept by the 1989-90 Detroit Pistons season, who would go on to win their second consecutive 1990 NBA Finals. Reggie Miller became the first Pacer to play in the 1990 NBA All-Star Game since 1976 on the strength of his 24.6 points-per-game average. Despite four straight first round exits, this period was highlighted by a first round series with the Boston Celtics in 1990-91 NBA season that went to Game 5. The next season, the Pacers returned to the playoffs in 1992 NBA Playoffs and met the 1991-92 Boston Celtics season for the second year in a row. But this time, the Celtics left no doubt who was the better team, as they swept the Pacers in three straight games. Chuck Person and point guard Micheal Williams were traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the off-season, and the Pacers got Pooh Richardson and Sam Mitchell (basketball) in return. For the 1992-93 NBA season, Detlef Schrempf moved from sixth man to the starter at small forward and was elected to his first All-Star game. Miller, meanwhile, became the Pacers all-time NBA era leading scorer during this season (4th overall).

"From November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields. By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha in the Hunan province.",0277a9f13d50ae18c95c750c7b371664,"How many months after the Battle of Changde began did the Japanese launch an operation against Brtisih positions in Assam, India?",4,2,naqanet,9aacd52e44c4e991fc9ffd044eb877f7,"How many months after the Battle of Changde began did the Japanese launch an operation against Brtisih positions in Assam, India?",4,3,nabert,6431023143f0f5170aa31396c269f205,How many months passed between the Battle of Changde and the Allied attack in Italy?,2,4,nabert,846ec27899e118e2177729f0cfa3c466,In what month did the Battle of Cahngde end?,December,1948.0,nabert,891c215dbb14f2e49a9e4ea18fe0b998,In what month did the Battle of Cahngde end?,December,November,naqanet,9a302f5f8c92c72bec604a9e66656ed8,The Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino how many years after the Chinese forces besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.?,1,-1,naqanet,028d44462af710e26f7f354c3ce1daee,"What happened first, The German forces were expelled from the Leningrad region or the Japanese launched the first of two invasions?",German forces were expelled,expelled German forces,naqanet,09eb9b43078cc29f82c0d84393fe8e66,What year did the Japanese launch a new attack on Changsha in the Hunan province?,1943,1944,naqanet,0b34812048e9ab46ef097193d817660d,"Which happened first in 1944, allies attacking at Monte Cassino or the British counteroffensive against the Japanese?",British counteroffensive against the Japanese,allies launched a series of attacks in italy against the line at monte cassino,nabert,8dd71e6360ccada2a3d18247627a4628,"Which happened first in 1944, allies attacking at Monte Cassino or the British counteroffensive against the Japanese?",British counteroffensive against the Japanese,at Monte Cassino,naqanet,e9e1d5087d648555060aab978d9b7175,"Which happened first in 1944, the allies attacking at Monte Cassino or the Soviets liberating Crimea?",allies attacking at Monte Cassino,at Monte Cassino,naqanet,15940f5bc2cca0672119079c745966d4,"Which happened first in 1944, the allies attacking at Monte Cassino or the Soviets liberating Crimea?",allies attacking at Monte Cassino,soviets had liberated crimea,nabert,702d6ed16286b2892c21baa47c83bec4,Who was responsible for ending the longest and most lethal siege in history?,Soviet,German forces,naqanet,c0cb84aec76da883aaaafa7d693abcbe,Who was responsible for ending the longest and most lethal siege in history?,Soviet,allies,nabert,bdda36478117cc436d26309e4b15b499,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"From the 17th century onwards, interest in the old library, with its manuscripts and incunabulae, went into decline and the modern library in the Jesuit College came to the fore. In 1756, the oldest university library was finally closed down and its books, 2,787 volumes, were incorporated into the Court Library, of which Gerard van Swieten was then director. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order (1773), the new ""Academic Library"" was created out of the book collections of the five Lower Austrian Colleges and a large number of duplicates from the Court Library. This was opened on 13 May 1777, the birthday of Maria Theresa of Austria, in the building of the Academic College. Initially, the stock consisted of some 45,000 books and during Emperor Joseph IIs dissolution of the monasteries, this was soon considerably extended. In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public. Between 1827 and 1829, it acquired the classicist extension (Postgasse 9) to the Academic College, in which it was to be accommodated until 1884. In this year, the main library, with some 300,000 books, moved to Heinrich von Ferstels new Main Building on the Ring, where stacks for some 500,000 volumes had already been prepared. With an annual growth of up to 30,000 volumes, the surplus space was soon filled. Book storage space had to be extended continuously. One hundred years later, the complete library, including departmental and subject libraries, comprised more than 4.3 million volumes. Today, Viennas University Library is the largest collection of books in Austria, still facing problems of space. In addition to the Main Library, which alone has to cope with an annual growth of 40,000 volumes, it includes three Faculty Libraries, 32 Subject Libraries and 26 Departmental Libraries.",79e8689d0f9ec38c7f3498ef7af8f8c1,"How many Faculty Libraries, Subject Libraries, and Departmental Libraries does Viennas University Library have?",61,58.0,nabert,d776ae9060c2efcc169eb78f1a55a7db,"How many books did the main library have in 1884, plus the volumes held in the Main Building on the Ring?",800000,300000,naqanet,6c7f5f7f11eabdc461a0241fd7bfd895,"How many books did the main library have in 1884, plus the volumes held in the Main Building on the Ring?",800000,502787.0,nabert,1c0c8f691efcbb2d3622bdd37fa39349,How many more volumes per year does the Main Library deal with compared to the growth of the Academic LIbrary 100 years prior?,10000,-10000.0,nabert,d7d24298bc7b5553df26b02ce556e93b,How many more volumes per year does the Main Library deal with compared to the growth of the Academic LIbrary 100 years prior?,10000,40000,naqanet,67671e7e510e0b195531b3a0c2da638c,Where did the Academic Library get its books?,five Lower Austrian Colleges Court Library,Austria,naqanet,ca5ff04f97bcc3415e47176d604b5dec,Where did the Academic Library get its books?,five Lower Austrian Colleges Court Library,the court library,nabert,95365c242f1acb312fbcfdb4e886b465,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Gamma Arietis, with a common name of Mesarthim, is a binary star with two white-hued components, located in a rich field of magnitude 8-12 stars. Its traditional name has conflicting derivations. It may be derived from a corruption of ""al-sharatan"", the Arabic word meaning ""pair"" or a word for ""fat ram"". However, it may also come from the Sanskrit for ""first star of Aries"" or the Hebrew for ""ministerial servants"", both of which are unusual languages of origin for star names. Along with Beta Arietis, it was known to the Bedouin as ""qarna al-hamal"". The primary is of magnitude 4.59 and the secondary is of magnitude 4.68. The system is 164 light-years from Earth. The two components are separated by 7.8 arcseconds, and the system as a whole has an apparent magnitude of 3.9. The primary has a luminosity of  and the secondary has a luminosity of ; the primary is an A-type star with an absolute magnitude of 0.2 and the secondary is a B9-type star with an absolute magnitude of 0.4. The angle between the two components is 1°. Mesarthim was discovered to be a double star by Robert Hooke in 1664, one of the earliest such telescopic discoveries. The primary, γ1 Arietis, is an Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable star that has a range of 0.02 magnitudes and a period of 2.607 days. It is unusual because of its strong silicon emission lines.",24657ea66ce7074d3a8c4778fc40976d,How many points difference is there between primary magnitude and secondary magnitude?,.09,-0.08999999999999986,nabert,3b283ec1eda5aa14f4cdab276024887b,How many points difference is there between primary magnitude and secondary magnitude?,.09,-4,naqanet,9f45956ccb5004b6c1f5a926a884e7d1,"Which start has a higher absolute magnitude, A-type star or B9-type star?",B9-type,B9-type star,naqanet,fd4f517e5ddc10e06db324db12ed1302,"Which start has a higher absolute magnitude, A-type star or B9-type star?",B9-type,b9 - type star,nabert,fb85ebb480b30ae4f72504232508499b,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Gebhard's supporter, Adolf von Neuenahr, surrounded Neuss in March 1586, and persuaded Ernst's small garrison to capitulate. He refortified and restocked the city and placed young Friedrich Cloedt in command of a garrison of 1600 men, mostly Germans and Dutch soldiers. The town's fortifications were substantial; 100 years earlier it had resisted a lengthy siege by Charles the Bold  of Burgundy, and between the fortifications, the natural defenses of rivers, and the garrison, it could withstand all but the most determined assaults. In July 1586, the Duke of Parma approached and surrounded the city; by some irony, Agnes' cousin, Karl von Mansfeld and his troops were a part of the Spanish force assembled against Neuss. Parma had an impressive force at his command; in addition to Mansfeld's 2000 troops, he had another 6000 or so foot and Tercios, 2000 well-mounted, experienced Italian, Spanish and German soldiers, and some 45 cannons, which he distributed on the redoubt across the river and on the heights a short distance from the city walls. According to the protocols of war generally accepted in 1586, Parma requested the capitulation of the city prior to the cannonade. Cloedt declined to capitulate, politely. The next day, being the feast of St. James, and the patron day for the Spanish, the bombardment was not initiated, although mendacious reports circulated in the Spanish camp that the Protestants had roasted two Spanish soldiers alive on the Catholic Holy day, a desecration which fanned their enthusiasm for the impending battle.",a9202b1d7283e7ea50fb4ffce0183c59,How many troops did Parma have at his command?,10000,2,naqanet,94eac4e6c55909b6f9293ba7b2492f19,How many troops did Parma have at his command?,10000,2045.0,nabert,b189062bef0903afbc89a10a1c0ce162,"Which troops of Parma forces were the largest in number, 6000 on foot or 2000 Mansfeld troops?",Mansfeld troops,2000 Mansfeld troops,naqanet,485dd29a2e6778b2abaf1c5b9036e5b0,"Which troops of Parma forces were the largest in number, 6000 on foot or 2000 Mansfeld troops?",Mansfeld troops,2000 troops,nabert,eb21c569d9e309f1e1ddfd4a198f4646,Who made up Parma's force?,Tercios Italian Spanish German,2000,nabert,94651aec243f198f14148b23d6ad0030,Who made up Parma's force?,Tercios Italian Spanish German,Karl von Mansfeld,naqanet,467cb904ee8852bb21db60b8bb7752e5,Who was in charge of Neuss before Cloedt was placed in command?,Ernst,Adolf von Neuenahr,naqanet,26e8fccdeac07ecbe196c446de5a3bc9,Who was in charge of Neuss before Cloedt was placed in command?,Ernst,friedrich cloedt,nabert,9f2ef9554b200ad39b24c3f2978fac52,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Gender disparity concern Future challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2010 census, males account for 51.27% of Chinas 1.34 billion people, while females made up 48.73% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005. In most western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%). At the moment there are about 9 million more boys than girls in China. The 2010 census reported a TFR of 1.18 (0.88 in cities, 1.15 in townships, and 1.44 in rural areas). The five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing (0.71), Shanghai (0.74), Liaoning (0.74), Heilongjiang (0.75), and Jilin (0.76).

"Hoping to rebound from their tough road loss to the Patriots, the Chiefs hosted their AFC West rival, the Oakland Raiders.  In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 56-yard and a 25-yard field goal. Chiefs quarterback Damon Huard suffered a neck injury in the first quarter and Tyler Thigpen substituted as quarterback for the remainder of the game. Huard was in for Kansas City's first two series, but didn't return after throwing an interception late in the second quarter. Marques Hagans, who was listed on the Chiefs' roster as a wide receiver, checked in as quarterback for several draw plays. The Chiefs announced at the end of the third quarter that Huard sustained ""mild head trauma,"" a move deemed controversial as Huard never sought medical attention in the following days. Under Thigpen, the Chiefs' offense struggled to move the ball down the field. In using three quarterbacks, the Chiefs had only 65 net yards at halftime. Raiders RB Darren McFadden got a 19-yard TD run in the third quarter. Oakland increased its lead with Janikowski nailing a 40-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. The Chiefs would respond with rookie QB Tyler Thigpen completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez, Kansas City executed a two-point conversion pass to rookie FB Mike Cox to make them within 8 points with just over five minutes remaining. The Chiefs' two-point conversion was the team's first in two years. Kansas City lost its opportunity to tie the game as the Raiders pulled away with RB Michael Bush getting a 32-yard TD run. The Chiefs' defense allowed the third-highest total yards on offense in franchise history. JaMarcus Russell completed only 6 of 17 passes for 55&#160;yards and led the Raiders to a 15-point victory. Following the game, Chiefs RB Larry Johnson voiced his displeasure with the Chiefs' offense and his role with the team. With the loss, the Chiefs fell to an 0-2 record for the third consecutive year.

"Hoping to snap their three-game losing streak, and coming off their bye week, the Broncos traveled to Sun Life Stadium to face the Miami Dolphins, where the Broncos had never won in their franchise history. After a scoreless first quarter, the Dolphins grabbed the lead in the second quarter, with field goals of 38 and 36 yards by kicker Dan Carpenter. After a scoreless third quarter, the Dolphins extended their lead in the fourth quarter, with quarterback Matt Moore throwing a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Anthony Fasano (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 43-yard field goal by Carpenter, giving Miami a 15-0 lead. However, after each team traded punts, the Broncos staged a rally with just over five minutes remaining, with quarterback Tim Tebow throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas to pull to within 15-7 with 2:44 remaining. After the Broncos recovered an onside kick, they subsequently marched down the field, with Tebow connecting on a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Fells, followed by Tebow scrambling for the two-point conversion to send the game into overtime. On the Dolphins' second possession in overtime, Broncos' linebacker D. J. Williams forced a fumble off Moore, giving the Broncos possession at the Dolphins' 36-yard line. Four plays later, kicker Matt Prater, who had missed two field goals in the first half, nailed the game-winning 52-yard field goal. With the win, the Broncos earned their 400th win in franchise history, their first-ever win at Miami in eight tries, and became the first team in NFL history since the AFL-NFL merger to win a game after trailing by 15 or more points with less than three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.",0a300d4c01489d3ae7d2e80457f50251,How many field goal kicks were missed?,2,3,nabert,3ad96caaab920ab4043084ab686f81d0,How many field goals did Dan Carpenter kick?,3,4,naqanet,7bb455263aab22fb6d30475f97574227,How many total field goals were kicked in the game?,4,5,naqanet,d6d9aa778575e9d768d8056fb51596a0,How many yards longer was Dan Carpenter's longest field goal than his shortest?,7,5,naqanet,c1255ef203a2538dffb24757454ae3f7,How many yards longer was Matt Prater's longest field goal than Dan Carpenter's longest?,9,16.0,nabert,3372a5a80f42ec81f1cbfdffbc383295,How many yards longer was Matt Prater's longest field goal than Dan Carpenter's longest?,9,5,naqanet,1b2736f144281362db220d846df03bdb,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"In 1570 MacGill reluctantly accepted appointment as Provost of Edinburgh. In November 1571, during the War between Leith and Edinburgh when Mary's supporters held Edinburgh Castle, MacGill was sent with Robert Pitcairn, Commander of Dunfermline to negotiate with Henry, Lord Hunsdon at Berwick upon Tweed. MacGill was to ask for 8 cannons, 3000 footmen and pikemen, and support for 1000 Scots troops, in the cause of the ""maintenance and protection of the true religion to the confusion of those that now goes about to disturb the same"". MacGill had a particular interest in the siege as the ""registers and records of the chief matters"" were guarded by artillery at Edinburgh Castle, together with the Scottish Crown jewels. The forces holding Edinburgh Castle, known as the Castilians, in 1572 twice destroyed MacGill's stronghouses in Edinburgh, and while the siege lasted the Burgh Council met in exile at Leith. Regent Morton wrote to MacGill in 1575 asking him to re-negotiate a gold and silver mining contract with the Dutch engineer Cornelius de Vos. A portrait painter working in Scotland at this time, Arnold Bronckorst, was associated with Cornelius and Nicholas Hilliard. Morton also obtained passports for MacGill's sons, John and David, to travel to France to continue their studies. MacGill died on 16 October 1579. Alexander Hay succeeded him as Lord Clerk Register.

"In 1611 a Swedish expeditionary corps under Jacob De la Gardie captured Novgorod. The Novgorodians asked the Swedish king to install one of his sons — Carl Filip or Gustavus Adolphus — as their monarch. In the meantime, Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the Swedish throne. The young king decided to press his brother's claim to the Russian throne even after the Poles had been expelled from Moscow by a patriotic uprising of 1612 and Mikhail Romanov had been elected a new tsar. While the Swedish statesmen envisaged the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to Archangelsk and eastwards to Vologda, De la Gardie and other Swedish soldiers, still holding Novgorod and Ingria, saw the war as a reaction for their forces not receiving payment for their succour during the De la Gardie Campaign. In 1613 they advanced towards Tikhvin and laid a siege to the city, but were repelled. The Russian counter-offensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle and the war lumbered on until 1614, when the Swedes captured Gdov. The following year they laid siege to Pskov but Russian generals Morozov and Buturlin held their own until 27 February 1617, when the Treaty of Stolbovo stripped Russia of its access to the Baltic Sea and awarded to Sweden the province of Ingria with the townships of Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye and Noteborg. Novgorod and Gdov were to be restituted to Russia. As a result of the war, Russia was denied access to the Baltic sea for about a century, despite its persistent efforts to reverse the situation. This led to the increased importance of Arkhangelsk for its trading connections with Western Europe.",5131fc6879a1d64de0648269ab1ee8e0,After the first attack in 1613 how many years passed before the Treaty of Stolbovo was signed?,4,1617,naqanet,8e217839ae1f5fe43ffe7b5982b63e75,After the first attack in 1613 how many years passed before the Treaty of Stolbovo was signed?,4,6.0,nabert,31a436c5ca2cb79e35471d402e8af037,How many contenders were there for the Swedish throne in 1611?,2,3,nabert,a667a866723ed8904bfa08b525c87215,How many contenders were there for the Swedish throne in 1611?,2,4,naqanet,d042983ab2a4ad3d29c5e655c8ece4b7,How many towhships were awarded to Sweden with the Treaty of Stolbovo?,4,3,naqanet,c89db85a256c2d8f9a7f9677c4e8584e,How many townships were restituted to Russia?,2,3,naqanet,c72184fb28b9270a884c076cf9d4cb25,How many townships were restituted to Russia?,2,4,nabert,ec43f9f4859d24f57516de457ad4e0e0,How many years after capturing Novgorod did the Swedes attempt a siege on Tikhvin?,2,3.0,nabert,ece2de563ac9ec7ef24402f665ab1203,How many years after the Swedes tried to lay siege to Pskov did the Treaty of Stolbovo strip Russia of its access to the Baltic Sea and the Swedes were awarded the province of Ingria?,2,3.0,nabert,805489cb6ef0e1444bf0e817e401204d,How many years after the Swedes tried to lay siege to Pskov did the Treaty of Stolbovo strip Russia of its access to the Baltic Sea and the Swedes were awarded the province of Ingria?,2,4,naqanet,9272a8a02b1d3b101309784765631e6b,How many years did the Siege of Pskov last?,2,4,naqanet,9b508d453377778b04c841bd583ed6b2,What happened first: Gardie captured Novgorod or a patriotic uprising?,Gardie captured Novgorod,Gardie captured Novgorod or a patriotic uprising,naqanet,4bdba551e296fd488c9257bc2724f2e6,What happened first: the Treaty of Stolbovo or Mikhail Romanov had been elected?,Mikhail Romanov had been elected,the Treaty of Stolbovo,naqanet,f2c65fd67011c2bc1757bd025b0d0978,What happened second: the Treaty of Stolbovo or Mikhail Romanov had been elected?,the Treaty of Stolbovo,Mikhail Romanov had been elected,naqanet,4b81a99b14f2e87e1bea3c9119c82299,What year did the Swedes lay siege to Pskov?,1615,1617,naqanet,fa0d91099e2c76e8f1ed7356d5b762ec,"Which happened first, Gustavus Adolphus succeeding to the Swedish throne, or his pressing his brother's claim to the Russian throne?",Gustavus Adolphus succeeded,press his brother,naqanet,a999293576391777c3cf3db11992e03c,"Which happened first, Gustavus Adolphus succeeding to the Swedish throne, or his pressing his brother's claim to the Russian throne?",Gustavus Adolphus succeeded,succeeded,nabert,01d555172ae553f52a604ce8b8222614,Whichcity became more important to the Russians after the Treaty of Stolbovo?,Arkhangelsk,Morozov,naqanet,e8b4588ddfd38e35b1b38fe359b0bf5f,Who succeeded to a throne first: Carl Filip or Gustavus Adolphus?,Gustavus Adolphus,Carl Filip,naqanet,42687f8deeffd79764641c675c007f20,none,none,none,none,none
"In 1664, a group of missionaries led by François Pallu, Bishop of Heliopolis, also of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, joined Lambert in the capital city of Ayutthaya after 24 months overland travel and started missionary work. In 1665-66 they built a seminary in Ayutthaya with the approval of King Narai, the Seminary of Saint Joseph . In 1669, Louis Laneau, Bishop of Motella, also a member of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, was named head of a Roman Catholic mission in mainland Southeast Asia, with his headquarters at Ayutthaya. They propagated the Christian faith and also took care of Annamite Christians and Japanese Christian communities in Thailand. Narai welcomed these missionaries, providing them with land for a church, a mission-house and a seminary .Bishops Lambert and Ballue established a Western hospital in Thailand in 1669 at Ayutthaya, with Father Laneau as the head doctor. The hospital provided medical care to about 200-300 people daily. During a 1670 trip to France, Pallu obtained from Louis XIV a letter to King Narai, which, together with a letter from the Pope, he remitted in Ayutthaya in October 1673 and which was received with great reverence. These contacts were closely associated with the development of French influence in South Asia, and especially with the establishment of the French East India Company in 1664, and the development of colonial French India.",9face3b855b8b7fe0b768bddde167486,How many years after the Seminary of Saint Joseph was built did Louis Laneau named head of the Roman Catholic mission?,3,4,naqanet,97dbde160a4a31c2b31e9d5c5e05972a,How many years after the missionaries arrived in Ayutthaya did the build the Seminary of Saint Joseph?,1,2,naqanet,1266bf53c5c876ceccadd47333d2e2f7,How many years did it take to build a seminary in Ayutthaya?,1,2,naqanet,ec389095bc43f070c775a05d78c7dff6,What was built with the approval of King Narai?,the Seminary of Saint Joseph,a seminary,nabert,fe561a46678f4328c6b715a295c50364,"Which happened first, the building of the hospital in Thailand, or Pallu's trip to France?",hospital in Thailand,the hospital,nabert,0350a6272371d72669926289e1f8ba09,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"In 1740, the Mon of Lower Burma revolted against the Toungoo Dynasty and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom based in Pegu . Throughout the 1740s, the Hanthawaddy forces were winning against Upper Burma-based Toungoo armies. The Siamese were concerned by another rising power in Burma since a strong Burma historically meant future invasions to Siam.  Concerned, the Siamese court readily gave protection to the Burmese governors of Martaban  and Tavoy who had fled to Siam. In 1745, they sent a diplomatic mission to Ava  to evaluate the political situation there, and were received by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi. They saw an Ava court that was on its last legs. By 1751, Restored Hanthawaddy forces were closing in on Ava. The Siamese concerns about the emergence of another strong dynasty based in Pegu appeared imminent. Perhaps as a precautionary measure, the Siamese decided to move their forward base into the upper coast in 1751.  While it remains unclear as to whether the Siamese ever intended  to go beyond the coast into mainland Lower Burma, the Siamese action nonetheless rang alarm bells in Pegu. Deeply concerned, the Hanthawaddy leadership withdrew two-thirds of their army back down to Lower Burma immediately after they had toppled the last Toungoo king in April 1752. This redeployment of Hanthawaddy troops proved a critical turning point in Burmese history as it gave nascent Upper Burmese resistance groups much needed breathing room. The Hanthawaddy command left less than 10,000 men to pacify all of Upper Burma.  Taking advantage of light Hanthawaddy troops, one resistance group, the Konbaung Dynasty led by Alaungpaya, drove out Hanthawaddy troops from Upper Burma by May 1754. Konbaung armies invaded Lower Burma in 1755, and captured Pegu in 1757, ending the 17-year-old Mon kingdom.",a0463776a65096e6fc5fbabd6b25ae5d,How many years after Hanthawaddy toppled the last Toungoo king Hanthawaddy themselves were driven out from Upper Burma?,2,-2,naqanet,59b872be620be2c529fb4035ef040288,How many years before the Konbaung armies captured Pegu did the Hanthawaddy leadership withdraw most of their army to Burma after they had toppled the last Toungoo king?,5,-5,naqanet,9fe658e17face6c8bfdaf89d7b8c771e,How many years did it take Alaungpaya and his dynasty to drive out Hanthawaddy troops from upper Burma after Hanthawaddy leadership had toppled the last Toungoo king?,2,-2,naqanet,32019cbb4145b4b5fd77e182eb67371c,How many years passed between the founding of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom and the invasion of Lower Burma?,15,12.0,nabert,67db523e61d73d438dc9378c687d2340,"What happened first, Siamese were in upper coast or Hanthawaddy withdrew army to Lower Burma?",Siamese were in upper coast,Hanthawaddy withdrew army to Lower Burma,naqanet,5de3f6da87a4f6008ae897a7426d07d2,What was created after the revolt against the Toungoo Dynasty,Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom,Pegu,naqanet,903089872a3fb674bb3a5b1bb883c0cf,When did the Hanthawaddi withdraw most of their troops from Upper Burma?,May 1754,1752,nabert,dae0304c5622f9b945b881ff0840e195,When did the Hanthawaddi withdraw most of their troops from Upper Burma?,May 1754,1754,naqanet,6eabc721468365196a62d3a4e725cb86,When were Hanthawaddy troops redeployed to lower Burma?,April 1752,0,naqanet,0928343fa6c14351f0ce45bb9f2178c0,When were Hanthawaddy troops redeployed to lower Burma?,April 1752,1752,nabert,af750f8f97d80cf0a51c2d1155fcadb0,Where were the Siamese recieved by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi?,Ava,"ava court that was on its last legs . by 1751 , restored hanthawaddy forces were closing in on ava",nabert,5d129084fd48cc106b1993596ce04f1f,Where were the Siamese recieved by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi?,Ava,mainland Lower Burma,naqanet,91c94933170d6bd390e168411cb7411d,Who sent a diplomatic mission to Ava in 1745?,the Siamese court,"Tavoy who had fled to Siam.

"In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico. The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of Mérida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905. These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigración Coreana a Yucatán, a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey.",c192c3a9334806cda2f291cc9579b4af,How many more Korean immigrants in 1905 that departed from Chemulpo were men than women or children?,571,201.0,nabert,384f89bf13bc9c441c93c72d805f73c2,How many years did the immigrants have to work as indentured laborers?,4,3,nabert,f9645d93082dc9dc281644b409d83d4f,Were there more men or women and children immigrants present?,men,women and children,naqanet,535735acad2310fb6e2a8613964173d6,"Were there more men or women and children who departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico?",men,women and children,naqanet,14dd5e93f34087cab1a743fad588dabc,What did the latest immigrants do to rememeber past immigrants?,a museum for the remembrance,marriages,nabert,26925f818c1d28a81f9541714a12bfa0,Which population groups consisted of less members than the male population?,women and children,Korean immigrants,naqanet,6f530befd12ca48abc320e51ba67c805,Which port did the Korean immigrants leave first Chemulpo or Veracruz?,Veracruz,chemulpo,nabert,8b04d1df26393585ecbe4cf4e78a6230,Which port did the Korean immigrants leave later Chemulpo or Veracruz?,Chemulpo,Veracruz,naqanet,a68b9291df5088eb8db7d176aa490aaf,Which town was a popular destination for the Korean immigrants?,"The town of Motul, Yucatan",Yucatan,naqanet,f7e9669e7db60ed4ecde2d71c12972e0,Which town was a popular destination for the Korean immigrants?,"The town of Motul, Yucatan",motul,nabert,68587d5bca55a50f3b2e1cf38338af61,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"In 1918, party membership was approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the ""Lenin Levy"", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed ""social-alien elements"" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million membersapproximately 10% of the Soviet Unions adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Unions 15 republics.

The power was supplied by Lorenzo Delacruz and Ryan Jones, who hit 19 and 18 home runs, respectively. Jones also had a team leading 72 RBI. Edwin Hurtado went 11–2 with a 2.95 ERA in 33 games, 16 of which were starts. The bullpen was headlined by Steve Sinclair and Dave Sinnes. Sinclair appeared in 37 games out of the bullpen and picked up a total of 9 wins with 105 innings pitched. Sinclair only made one start for the Suns all year. Closer Sinnes tied for the South Atlantic League lead with 37 saves. The Suns advanced to the league championship.

"In 2004 Philadelphia Eagles season, the Philadelphia Eagles had their best season since 1960, going 13-1 before resting their starters and losing their next 2, clinching the number one seed for the second year in a row. McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didnt play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, Terrell Owens, who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After defeating the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons, the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the 2004 New England Patriots season. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14-14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate.

"In 2009, the Libyan Army (1951-2011) consisted of 25,000 volunteers with an additional 25,000 conscripts (total 50,000). At that time, the army was organised into 11 Border Defence and 4 Security Zones, one regime security brigade, 10 Tank Battalions, 10 Mechanized Infantry Battalions, 18 Infantry Battalions, 6 Commando Battalions, 22 Artillery Battalions, 4 SSM Brigade and 7 Air Defence Artillery Battalions. Khamis Gaddafis 32nd Brigade was one of the main regime protection forces. The Khamis Brigade was considered by US diplomats in 2009 as the most capable of defending the regime.

"In 326 BCE, Alexander the Great invaded Pauravas and defeated King Porus. His armies entered the region via the Hindu Kush in northwest Pakistan and his rule extended up to the city of Sagala . In 305 BCE the area was ruled by the Maurya Empire. In a long line of succeeding rulers of the area, Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka stand out as the most renowned. The Maurya presence in the area was then consolidated in the Indo-Greek Kingdom in 180 BCE. Menander I Soter ""The Saviour""  is the most renowned leader of the era, he conquered the Punjab and made Sagala the capital of his Empire. Menander carved out a Greek kingdom in the Punjab and ruled the region till his death in 130 BCE. The neighbouring Seleucid Empire rule came to an end around 12 BCE, after several invasions by the Yuezhi and the Scythian people. In 711-713 CE, the 18-year-old Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim of Taif, a city in what is now Saudi Arabia, came by way of the Arabian Sea with Arab troops to defeat Raja Dahir.

"In 993, Khitans under General Xiao Sunning invaded Korea, but retreated after truce negotiations with minister Seo Hui of Goryeo, establishing friendly relations between the two nations. In 1004, the Liao dynasty repulsed Song China. Subsequently, as part of peace negotiations, Song China to paid tribute to the Liao emperor. However, the tension between Goryeo and Liao created another war. In 1009, General Gang Jo of Goryeo led a coup against King Mokjong, killing the king and establishing military rule. In 1010, the alliance was broken and Liao attacked Korea for General Gang's treason. Also, Khitans claimed six garrison settlements east of the Yalu River, which Goryeo claimed as its territory in truce negotiations during 993. After suffering numerous and heavy casualties against the Goryeo army, the Khitans managed to defeat Gangjo, who had begun to underestimate them. Despite this defeat, the Goryeo king managed to retain his claim on the six garrison settlements. The Khitans retreated from the peninsula, with no great prize for the war, but they did not give up their hope of gaining the six garrison settlements and making Goryeo pay tribute. However, beginning in the summer of 1018, the Khitans constructed a bridge across the Yalu River.",ac471eb5a486fc5e00adc641f54acd69,How many times did the Liao dynasty have violent conflict between 1000 and 1010?,3,2,naqanet,e8f2510ca749cbde5d13910e3ffd4764,What dynasty repulsed Song China?,the Liao dynasty,General Xiao,naqanet,c8b4b9052239d7c5465c37bd5d2143cc,Which two nations became friendly after one invaded the other?,Khitans Korea,General Xiao,naqanet,68da75938d87dfc431c116ca26c9746e,Which two nations became friendly after one invaded the other?,Khitans Korea,korea,nabert,de0eb24207f093a96c6cc920fb163028,Which two nations established friendly relations in 993?,Khitans Korea,Khitans under General Xiao,naqanet,8a1c68d54bf4f93ec5a53c46009263ac,Which two nations established friendly relations in 993?,Khitans Korea,two,nabert,bc5197acdd22b3aef8d007afb4a81321,Which two rulers established friendly relations in 993?,General Xiao Sunning Seo Hui,Seo Hui of Goryeo,naqanet,aa1a3771737e715d54c0621dd9d742e5,Which two rulers established friendly relations in 993?,General Xiao Sunning Seo Hui,minister seo hui of goryeo,nabert,daa930d5d30821572bf7dd32e3ce6415,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"In County Wexford, 100-200 Volunteers—led by Robert Brennan, Séamus Doyle and Seán Etchingham—took over the town of Enniscorthy on Thursday 27 April until Sunday. Volunteer officer Paul Galligan had cycled 200 km from rebel headquarters in Dublin with orders to mobilise. They blocked all roads into the town and made a brief attack on the RIC barracks, but chose to blockade it rather than attempt to capture it. They flew the tricolour over the Athenaeum building, which they had made their headquarters, and paraded uniformed in the streets. They also occupied Vinegar Hill, where the United Irishmen had made a last stand in the 1798 rebellion. The public largely supported the rebels and many local men offered to join them. By Saturday, up to 1,000 rebels had been mobilised, and a detachment was sent to occupy the nearby village of Ferns. In Wexford, the British assembled a column of 1,000 soldiers , two field guns and a 4.7 inch naval gun on a makeshift armoured train. On Sunday, the British sent messengers to Enniscorthy, informing the rebels of Pearse's surrender order. However, the Volunteer officers were skeptical.

"In February 1479, a Portuguese army commanded by Garcia de Meneses, Bishop of Évora, penetrated into Extremadura. His objective was to occupy and reinforce the strongholds of Mérida and Medellín, controlled by Beatriz Pacheco, Countess of Medellin and supporter of Afonso V. According to Palencia, the Portuguese army was composed of about 1,000 Knights , plus infantry. 180 Knights of the Order of Santiago marched alongside him, commanded by their treasurer, Alfonso de Monroy. On February 24, near the hill of Albuera, the army was challenged by Isabellian forces commanded by Alonso de Cárdenas, Master of the Order of Santiago. The army consisted of 500 Knights of the Order, 400 Knights of the Hermandad , and 100 infantrymen. The battle was heavily contested. The Isabellian infantry suffered a severe blow from the Juanist cavalry and became disorganized, but intervention by the Master of Santiago aided the panicked infantry. The Portuguese were forced to retreat, leaving significant spoils of war on the battlefield, as well as around 85 dead Knights. Only 15 Isabellian Knights were killed. The bulk of the Portuguese army was able to take refuge in Mérida and from there continued its march to Medellín, which they occupied.

"In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over Bessarabia as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany.

"In October 1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara's Flare and Sharp's Extended Vector Animation formats. Several developers quickly created a C library for producing SWF. In February 1999, MorphInk 99 was introduced, the first third-party program to create SWF files. Macromedia also hired Middlesoft to create a freely available developers' kit for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5. Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a non-disclosure agreement, but they are widely available from various sites. In April 2006, the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format . Although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats , this new documentation covered all the new features offered in Flash v8 including new ActionScript commands, expressive filter controls, and so on. The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format. The license does not allow the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of Flash files. The Flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions. In June 2009, Adobe launched the Open Screen Project , which made the SWF specification available without restrictions. Previously, developers could not use the specification for making SWF-compatible players, but only for making SWF-exporting authoring software. The specification still omits information on codecs such as Sorenson Spark, however.",99c6d5617b43f09ccc45d10e95d1ed39,How many SWF file format versions did Macromedia hire Middlesoft to create a developers' kit for?,3,2,naqanet,c1b889624d98ad115216aa9a162dc097,How many months after Macromedia disclosed Flash 3 was Morphlnk 99 introduced?,4,2,naqanet,bc32abc670cc997f5949d0eeacba4e49,How many months after Macromedia disclosed Flash 3 was Morphlnk 99 introduced?,4,96.0,nabert,6be335834550025bf60a7b4e546a8dde,How many months after Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification on its website was MorphInk 99 was introduced?,4,2,naqanet,15c357d5e2e9c24c362b667f4943968c,How many months after Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification on its website was Morphlnk 99 introduced?,4,2,naqanet,51023f91d5d6f66f8219e37e8d122654,How many months were there between the disclosure of Flash Version 3 and the introduction of MorphInk 99?,4,2,naqanet,3f8ac87a54669244cad79c01deb8d01f,How many months were there between the disclosure of Flash Version 3 and the introduction of MorphInk 99?,4,6,nabert,c35e860336ad873106dbf8d508bb494e,How many other companies was it competing with for semi-open formats?,2,3,naqanet,d433df37ff03bad936a5c83fa9296c06,How many versions of Flash had been put out by 1998,3,6,naqanet,64b6334cc10aa2bab67e8d8b1a52ac1e,How many versions of the SWF file format was the Middlesoft developer's kit made for?,3,2,naqanet,e5b244eea54a46b29db2e67b33884242,How many years after Flash SWF file format specification was released did Adobe launch the Open Screen Project?,3,11.0,nabert,d2a96461aae26fb4a276eb0abba85e6e,How many years passed between the disclosure of Flash Version 3 and the release of the Flash SWF file format?,8,-1993.0,nabert,84b74c4fbe0a6f10a0694a09c96f9ab0,What companies was it competing with for semi-open formats?,Xara Sharp,Xara's Flare,naqanet,96f1603680fb43d5fd6a4dbf9d3f2f90,What companies was it competing with for semi-open formats?,Xara Sharp,swf,nabert,865fb2d4641e335e9582926e276ac6cb,"What happened first, launch of Open Screen Project or  Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3?",Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3,Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification,naqanet,8c0c3f41453e094af5de531bcbab4320,"What happened first, launch of Open Screen Project or  Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3?",Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3,macromedia disclosed the flash,nabert,779cbfbca27246c6a918e1bce3eeb00a,"Which was released first, Sharp's Extended Vector Animation formats or Flash Version 3?",Sharp's Extended Vector Animation,flash version 3,nabert,1faf6a5d9c32f30e2107df9412ddb217,"Which was released first, the Flash SWF file format specification or Open Screen Project?",Flash SWF file format specification,Flash SWF file format specification or Open Screen Project,naqanet,8e1221959786bb3be7dc760944cf860e,Why was Middlesoft brought onboard?,create a freely available developers' kit,freely available developers ' kit,nabert,17a045ded65e38335ae7ba0c64d697a5,Why was Middlesoft brought onboard?,create a freely available developers' kit,kit for the SWF file,naqanet,efd2a7c054e1dce76bbdbaa2d632c30c
"In September 1998, Barzani and Talabani signed the U.S.-mediated Washington Agreement establishing a formal peace treaty. In the agreement, the parties agreed to share revenue, share power, deny the use of northern Iraq to the PKK, and not allow Iraqi troops into the Kurdish regions. The United States pledged to use military force to protect the Kurds from possible aggression by Saddam Hussein. At the same time, implementation of the U.N. Oil-for-Food Programme brought revenue to northern Iraq, allowing for increased standards of living. Iraqi Kurdistan became a relatively peaceful region, before the terrorist group Ansar al-Islam entered the area in December 2001, bringing renewed conflict. Around a month later, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act into law, providing for military assistance to Iraqi opposition groups, including the PUK and KDP. The KDP estimated that 58,000 of its supporters had been expelled from PUK-controlled regions from October 1996 to October 1997. The PUK says 49,000 of its supporters were expelled from KDP-controlled regions from August 1996 to December 1997. The PUK and KDP later co-operated with American forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, routing Iraqi forces with the help of American air power and overrunning much of northern Iraq including the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul.

"In a matchup of fellow rookie quarterbacks Geno Smith and E.J.

"In early 1765, a 20,000-strong Burmese army stationed at Kengtung, led by Gen. Ne Myo Thihapate, left Kengtung for yet another Burmese invasion of Siam. With the main Burmese army gone, Liu used a few minor trade disputes between local Chinese and Burmese merchants as the excuse to order an invasion of Kengtung in December 1765. The invasion force, which consisted of 3,500 Green Standard troops along with Tai-Shan militias, laid siege to Kengtung but could not match battle-hardened Burmese troops at the Kengtung garrison, led by Gen. Ne Myo Sithu. The Burmese lifted the siege and pursued the invaders into Pu'er Prefecture, and defeated them there. Ne Myo Sithu left a reinforced garrison, and returned to Ava in April 1766. Governor Liu, in his embarrassment, first tried to conceal what had happened. When the emperor became suspicious, he ordered Liu's immediate recall and demotion. Instead of complying, Liu committed suicide by slicing his throat with a stationery knife, writing as blood was pouring from his neck: ""There is no way to pay back the emperor's favor. I deserve death with my crime"". While this kind of suicide in the face of bureaucratic failure apparently was not unusual in Qing China, it reportedly enraged the Emperor nonetheless.

"In early July, Verijsel received 360 Ambonese troops, led by Kraeng Tanate, to aid him in the defence of Semarang. On 21 July, Captain Gerrit Mom arrived from Sulawesi with 800 troops to serve as further reinforcements. Mom and Tanate were then sent to recapture Demak, occupied by 4,000 rebels under the command of the Chinese general Singseh and Javanese general Raden Suryakusuma. The ensuing battle took place over several days and resulted in a Dutch victory. The Dutch troops continued on to Kudus, where an estimated 2,000 Chinese soldiers were awaiting arrivals from Kartosuro. With their numbers reinforced by further troops led by Ngabehi Secanegara from Jepara and Captain Hendrik Brule from Semarang, Mom and Tanate recaptured the city without a fight on 28 August. After the recapture of Demak and Kudus, the remaining regents began to surrender, promised pardon by Pakubuwono II. The Chinese and Javanese rebel coalition, which was beginning to unravel, continued to hold Kartosuro until December 1742, being only chased out of the city when Cakraningrat IV came and retook it. Although the Javanese were allowed to escape unmolested, the Chinese were only able to escape to nearby Prambanan after a ""pitched battle"" in Asem. Two months later the Chinese, accompanied by noted Javanese leader Pakunegara, made a last stand but were defeated and forced to run to the foothills along the southern coast.

"In literature, apart from Scott's Waverley novels, the best-known books with the Rebellion as a backdrop include Robert Louis Stevenson's novels Kidnapped and Catriona, the Jacobite trilogy by D.K. Broster and in modern times, Diana Gabaldon's Outlander novels. While not strictly related to the '45, the British author Joan Aiken wrote a series of children's books set in an alternative 18th-century Britain where James II was never deposed and his son James III battles constant pro-Hanoverian conspiracies. Significant screen versions include 1948's Bonnie Prince Charlie starring David Niven who summarised it as 'one of those huge, florid extravaganzas that reek of disaster from the start' and Culloden, Peter Watkins' 1964 docu-drama. In addition to the current Outlander TV series, the aftermath of the Rebellion is the theme of the now lost 1966 Dr Who series The Highlanders. Musical references to the '45 are numerous, both in bagpipe music  and in song; the most famous is the Skye Boat Song but there are many others, one collection being the 1960 album Songs of Two Rebellions: The Jacobite Wars of 1715 and 1745 in Scotland by Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger.",38a6e06137d80dbd28b9f6e0e94e21be,How many Jacobite Wars were there in the first part of the eighteenth century?,2,3,naqanet,56ac4270b15c1ef541df87ef1861b7f2,How many parts are there in  the Jacobite trilogy by D.K.

"In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković.

"In the course of the Lutheran Reformation numerous Imperial States had adopted the new confession, against the opposition of the ruling Catholic House of Habsburg, who recognised these conversions as a quest for increasing autonomy to the detriment of the central Imperial authority. At the 1521 Diet of Worms Emperor Charles V had Martin Luther banned and the proliferation of his writings prohibited, which in 1529 provoked the Protestation at Speyer by several Lutheran estates.  The tensions culminated to an open conflict over the Lutheran Augsburg Confession of 1530, the Apology of which, written by Philipp Melanchthon, was rejected by the Emperor. In turn several Lutheran states led by Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse met at the town of Schmalkalden, where they established the Schmalkaldic League in 1531. In 1544 Charles V returned to Germany from the Italian War after he had signed the Treaty of Crépy and began to forge alliances not only with Pope Paul III but also with Lutheran princes, foremost with Duke Maurice of Saxony, the Albertine cousin of Saxon Elector John Frederick I. In view of the Emperor's preparations for battle, the Schmalkaldic leaders on 4 July 1546 gathered at Ichtershausen and agreed that a preventive strike would be advisable, as long as Charles V had not concentrated a significant amount of mercenaries. The Emperor gathered an army of around 52,000 men  for his campaign, that was to start on the Danube.",892c16bf8e89177ca59d913e2125bba9,How many years after the Protestation at Speyer did the Lutheran Augsburg Confession take place?,1,-1,naqanet,f3e3e925c5026b92f6a615403934f521,What was John Frederick I's title?,Saxon Elector,Emperor,naqanet,0980c787564e5dac5b26a413b5ac455e,What was John Frederick I's title?,Saxon Elector,"duke maurice of saxony , the albertine cousin",nabert,5b40519569aa4f02fec809bdae60d7f4,"Which happened first, the Diet of Worms, or the Protestation at Speyer?",Diet of Worms,"Diet of Worms Emperor Charles V had Martin Luther banned and the proliferation of his writings prohibited, which in 1529 provoked the Protestation at Speyer",naqanet,c7ecd2d1b885023c418a5a74be28586e,"Which happened first, the establishment of the Schmalkaldic League, or the Treaty of Crépy?",the Schmalkaldic League,established the Schmalkaldic League,naqanet,014ffb27cc7925d2af7c4d4c24fcd422,Whose Apology was rejected by Charles V?,Philipp Melanchthon,Emperor,naqanet,6b848d582ee016eed59107eac6259c1f,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"In the spring of 2000, Walkertons system typically drew most of its water from one well at a time, alternating unevenly between wells 5, 6, and 7. Well 7 was turned off between March 10 and May 2, ran alone from May 2 through May 9 before turning off again, and was then used again between May 15 and May 19. From May 9 to May 13, Well 5 provided the bulk of Walkertons water, supplemented from May 10–13 by Well 6.

"In their Week 2 home-opener, the Vikings faced the Carolina Panthers in a low-scoring fight. The Vikings would draw first blood with a 26-yard field goal by kicker Ryan Longwell. In the second quarter, Carolina got a field goal with opposing kicker John Kasay. The Vikings would respond with another Longwell field goal (a 22-yard FG), but they fell before halftime with opposing RB DeAngelo Williams getting a 3-yard run for the Panthers. The Vikings trailed a bit further in the third quarter, as Karney kicked a 26-yard field goal. The Vikings started their own comeback. In the fourth quarter, Longwell faked a field goal try and threw a 16-yard TD pass to FB Richard Owens to tie the game up going into overtime. In OT, Longwell booted the game-winning 19-yard field goal to give Minnesota the win.

"Instead, the Allies spent 1702 and 1703 taking towns such as Venlo and Roermond in the modern Dutch province of Limburg, as well as Liège, Bonn and Huy. Failure to take Antwerp in May 1703 ended hopes of a quick victory while a Dutch army under Slangenburg was surrounded by a French force several times their size at Ekeren on 30 June and only just escaped. Recriminations were considerable, with Slangenburg blaming his commander Obdam but also Marlborough and Van Coehoorn for failing to support him. Van Coehoorn was a difficult character with few friends while William's death in March 1702 deprived him of his most powerful sponsor and much of his influence. The campaigns of 1702 and 1703 showed his limitations as a field officer and led to criticism from both Marlborough and Dutch colleagues. In early 1704, he spoke with the Envoy of Savoy about possible opportunities in their army but died on 17 March in The Hague attending a conference with Marlborough.

The city was occupied by French forces for six years between 1757 and 1763, as part of the conditions of the Second Treaty of Versailles between France and Austria. A large waterworks infrastructure project called the Ganzepoot  was constructed in Nieuwpoort in the 19th century to drain the polders and channel water in and around the town and to the North Sea.

"Japan, Canada and New Zealand are perceived as evolving destinations for international students. In 2006, Japan, Canada and New Zealand together shared roughly 13% of the international student market, with approximately 327,000 of the 2.7 million students who traveled abroad for the purposes of higher education. Japan has around 180 000 overseas students studying at its institutions and the government has set targets to increase this to 300, 000 over the next few years. Canada has seen a large increase in the number of Indian students, where the number of Indian students rose 280% in 2010 compared to 2008. Organizations such as Learnhub are taking advantage of this growing trend of Indian international students by providing recruitment services that bring Indian students abroad. In 2012, in Canada 10 percent of university students were international students.  Canada accepted more than 100,000 international students for the first time, bringing the total number of international students in Canada to 260,000, which is nearly identical to that of Australias 280,000. Recent changes to Canadas immigration regulations that came into effect on January 1, 2015 have placed international graduates from Canadian universities at a disadvantage.

"Knopf was founded in 1915 by Alfred A. Knopf Sr. along with Blanche Knopf, on a $5,000 advance from his father, Samuel Knopf. The first office was located in New York's Candler Building. The publishing house was officially incorporated in 1918, with Alfred Knopf as president, Blanche Knopf as vice-president, and Samuel Knopf as treasurer. From the start, Knopf focused on European translations and high-brow works of literature. Among their initial publications were French author Émile Augier's Four Plays, Russian writer Nikolai Gogol's Taras Bulba, Polish novelist Stanisław Przybyszewski's novel Homo Sapiens, and French writer Guy de Maupassant's Yvette, a novelette, and Ten Other Stories.

"Knopf was founded in 1915 by Alfred A. Knopf Sr. along with Blanche Knopf, on a $5,000 advance from his father, Samuel Knopf. The first office was located in New York's Candler Building. The publishing house was officially incorporated in 1918, with Alfred Knopf as president, Blanche Knopf as vice-president, and Samuel Knopf as treasurer. From the start, Knopf focused on European translations and high-brow works of literature. Among their initial publications were French author Émile Augier's Four Plays, Russian writer Nikolai Gogol's Taras Bulba, Polish novelist Stanisław Przybyszewski's novel Homo Sapiens, and French writer Guy de Maupassant's Yvette, a novelette, and Ten Other Stories.

"Late in the 18th Century, Qing dynasty set about a momentous task, the creation of the Siku Quanshu. The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board  was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included over 361 scholars, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong  as chief editors. There was around 3,826 scribes who copied every word by hand. These copyists were not paid in coinage but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia. It took over a decade until the encyclopedia was completed and all seven copies were distributed.",35b558159bbca099157a4d08cf01e696,"How many copyists and scholars in total were called upon to gather, review, and copy books brought to them?",4187,361,naqanet,a182264bb9eb6f1cc9599b89eba7ee9d,How many scholars and scribes were in the editorial board created in march of 1773?,4187,722.0,nabert,15c94204d51bba7167f1c9810df47209,Were there fewer scribes or scholars?,scholars,scribes,naqanet,3b688c29f18fab05dd78cfcbce444897,"Which were there less of, scholars or scribes?",scholars,scribes,naqanet,bc9d16caa7443951106dc428c30a211a,"Who the smallest group of people, 3,826 scribes or 361 scholars?",361 scholars,"3 , 826 scribes",nabert,75d0979af4b3e80c5d53816c5bbc87f1,"Who the smallest group of people, 3,826 scribes or 361 scholars?",361 scholars,scribes,naqanet,c613d5628dbedee4306870281450df6f,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Law-abiding by nature, Armenian-Cypriots always had a high profile with the British administration and many became conscientious civil servants and disciplined policemen or were employed at the Cyprus Government Railway and at Cable and Wireless. Throughout the 1920s-1950s, many worked at the asbestos mines at Amiandos and the copper mines at Mavrovouni and Skouriotissa, some of whom had been trade unionists. Some Armenian-Cypriots participated in the 1897 Greco-Turkish War, the two World Wars and the EOKA struggle. Also, the Eastern Legion was formed and trained between December 1916 and May 1918 in Monarga village, near Boghazi, consisting of over 4,000 Diasporan Armenian volunteers who fought against the Ottoman Empire. Some Armenian refugees arrived from Palestine and Egypt. The Armenian-Cypriot community prospered throughout the British Era, by establishing associations. In many ways unique across the whole Armenian Diaspora, it was built just outside Nicosia between 1924-1926, after the generous and benevolent donation of the Egyptian-Armenian tobacco trading brothers Krikor and Garabed Melkonian, initially in order to shelter and educate 500 orphans of the Genocide, who planted the trees in front of the school in memory of their slaughtered relatives.

"Led by former Giant Kurt Warner, the defending NFC champions took the field at Giants Stadium against a Giants team still reeling from their bad loss in New Orleans. The Giants scored first, sending Jacobs in for a 4-yard touchdown run following a Terrell Thomas interception. Later, Arizona running back Beanie Wells scored his first career touchdown on a 13-yard rush. Manning responded by throwing a 62-yard touchdown to Nicks for his longest reception of the year. In the second half, the Cardinals' Tim Hightower and Jason Wright scored touchdowns. But it was turnovers that decided this game; Manning's 3 interceptions were as many as he had thrown all season. The Giants scored only 3 points in the second half, ending the game on an interception to Antrel Rolle. The Giants notable streak of 38 consecutive starts by the same offensive line unit was ended here, as offensive tackle Kareem McKenzie missed the game with a groin injury.

"Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing sub-replacement fertility; its estimated total fertility rate of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999.

Beckham appeared to have the catch, but as he brought the ball up in celebration, it was knocked out by Malcolm Butler in a play eerily similar to a drop by Lee Evans in the closing seconds of the 2011 AFC Championship Game. Manning scrambled for a loss on third down, and Josh Brown kicked the go-ahead field goal to give New York a lead. However, a last second game-winning field goal by the Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski ended the Giants hopes. Although he was cleared to play, Victor Cruz, a day later, announced he would not play this season as he underwent surgery to repair an injured left calf.",c4b2200d3d38a8f58133908f0f0ff695,How many games had the Patriots lost all season?,0,2,naqanet,def2aa59f7a45b18b09a261d32223b82,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Mehmed built a fleet to besiege the city from the sea .Contemporary estimates of the strength of the Ottoman fleet span between about 110 ships , 145 , 160 , 200-250  to 430 .

An August 2011 poll found her coalition had only 36% support compared to a rival potential coalitions 51%. However, she scored well on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012 and again in July 2014. Merkels approval rating dropped to 54% in October 2015, during the European migrant crisis, the lowest since 2011. According to a poll conducted after List of Islamist terrorist attacks in 2016 in Germany Merkels approval rating dropped to 47% (August 2016). Half of Germans did not want her to serve a fourth term in office compared to 42% in favor. However, according to a poll taken in October 2016, her approval rating had been found to have risen again, 54% of Germans were found to be satisfied with work of Merkel as Chancellor.

"More than 5,000 US troops of General John J. Pershing's forces, including elements of the 7th Cavalry and the African-American U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment, entered Mexico in hot pursuit of Villa. The campaign consisted primarily of dozens of minor skirmishes with small bands of insurgents. Gen. Pershing failed to catch up to Villa. On 21 June 1916, two troops of the 10th, totaling 92 troopers, attacked Mexican Federal Army troops in an engagement in the Battle of Carrizal, Chihuahua. 12 US troops were killed and 23 taken prisoner; 45 Federales were casualties, including the Mexican general Gomez.

"Northern Europe is home to a large bear population, with an estimated 2,500 (range 2,350-2,900) in Sweden, about 2,200 in Finland, about 700 in Estonia and 70 in Norway, totaling to nearly 5,000 individuals in the wild. Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500-3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. Brown bears inhabited the mountains of Austria until as recently as 2011, after a reintroduction effort failed and the species became extinct again. There is currently no effort to reintroduce the species into Austria. The entire alpine population of brown bears includes about 50 individuals, most of them living in the Adamello-Presanella Alps in Italy. Reintroduction of 10 Slovenian brown bears to the Trentino area in 1998 and 2002 produced occasional visitors to the South Tirol, the Swiss Geography of the Alpss, Bavaria and isolated sightings in the Geography of the Alpss.

"On 10 September 1580, 600 Papal troops  commanded by Sebastiano di San Giuseppe , landed in Smerwick, near the same point where Fitzmaurice had landed the previous year. They had been paid for and sent by Pope Gregory to aid the rebellion. Desmond, Baltinglass and John of Desmond made an effort to link up with the expeditionary force but English forces under Ormonde and Grey blocked them and prompt naval action by Richard Bingham blockaded the Papal force's ships into the bay at Smerwick. San Giuseppe had no choice but to fortify his men in the fort at Dún an Óir. In October 1580, Grey de Wilton with up to 4000 troops arrived at Smerwick and laid siege to the garrison. The invasion forces were geographically isolated on the tip of the narrow Dingle Peninsula, cut off by Mount Brandon on one side and the much larger English force on the other. They had no means of escape. In addition, the English had brought up heavy artillery by sea, which rapidly broke down the improvised defences of Dún an Óir. After a three-day siege, commander Di san Giuseppe surrendered on 10 October 1580. Grey de Wilton ordered the massacre of the invasion forces, sparing only the commanders. Italian and Spanish troops, and Irish men and women, were beheaded and their bodies thrown into the sea. Among the English soldiers present at the siege and massacre was the writer and explorer Walter Raleigh. This was brought against him as a criminal charge in one of his trials. Raleigh argued that he was ""obliged to obey the commands of his superior officer"" but he was unable to exonerate himself.",3e8f70bc4f3dc8f3d31699ac49254f0a,How many days after Sebastiano di San Giuseppe landed in Smerwick did he surrender?,30,0,naqanet,f4596edf6c2c6fe37ef96ebe8faf021d,How many months after 600 Papal troops landed in Smerwich did Grey de Wilton arrive with 4000 troops?,1,2,naqanet,e5c2ee4e0ee18a88c774ba0003d4087e,How many months did these events span for?,2,3,nabert,fcf672d34470560384ac523ceea7aa7f,How many months into the year of 1580 did commander Di san Giuseppe surrender?,10,2,naqanet,b886a0cf24f06616b2b6aa7a9eb541d5,How many months into the year of 1580 did commander Di san Giuseppe surrender?,10,3,nabert,502622de0b38bdb576f2636fd75dbfd0,On what day did the seige again the troops led by di San Giuseppe which would lead to his surrender begin?,October 7 1580,1580,naqanet,890296c2fec8bfd8e3fda8b6dd9ef5eb,On what day did the seige again the troops led by di San Giuseppe which would lead to his surrender begin?,October 7 1580,october,nabert,af8bc114a515af2e1cb725420edb6e60,What year did Fitzmaurice arrive in Smerwick?,1579,1580,naqanet,cbcafac438698fea8203e272d9b45d04,"Which happened first, Di san Giuseppe surrendering or the landing in Smerwick?",landing in Smerwick,di San Giuseppe,naqanet,dfa6753fa84b15337f8d66bbd7c8142b,"Which happened first, Di san Giuseppe surrendering or the landing in Smerwick?",landing in Smerwick,landed in smerwick,nabert,0181901c9a1a5e8704de4cf694de5262,Which two men landed in Smerwick?,Sebastiano di San Giuseppe Fitzmaurice,Papal troops,naqanet,c2041dab515fc366ab530bea23e0fe9f,Which two men landed in Smerwick?,Sebastiano di San Giuseppe Fitzmaurice,sebastiano di san giuseppe,nabert,8e260571ed38d2c180a4db079f5153dd,"Who arrived in Smerwick first, Grey de Wilton or Papal troops?",Papal troops,Grey de Wilton,naqanet,c4ce7e3a4ab583612f5e8c92151d4c69,"Who landed in Smerwick later, Fitzmaurice or Sebastiano di San Giuseppe?",Sebastiano di San Giuseppe,fitzmaurice,nabert,d3ca3ef3999de7ff30955096081b8d75,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"On 12 November , a Constituent Assembly was elected. In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets. On 16 December 1917 , the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated. On 20 December 1917 , the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The Red Terror was started in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin's life. The Jacobin Terror was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. Leon Trotsky had compared Lenin to Maximilien Robespierre as early as 1904. The Decree on Land ratified the actions of the peasants who throughout Russia gained private land and redistributed it among themselves. The Bolsheviks viewed themselves as representing an alliance of workers and peasants and memorialized that understanding with the Hammer and Sickle on the flag and coat of arms of the Soviet Union.Other decrees:",e75e70c28254079397179d0a4ffdc5a9,How many mandatory candidates in total were there for the election?,84,27.0,nabert,7ee81c6083097678f70f8a865e83d86c,How many months after its formation was the Consstituent Assembly dissolved?,2,5,nabert,f6b815d93323e24f1ed893ffae63e1a2,How many months after the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin did the Red Terror begin?,9,2,naqanet,1b1df1c5a4e455812fe53b35623647ab,How many months after the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin did the Red Terror begin?,9,4,nabert,1b0717a5c90236bd30b2453ee98098ee,How many months after the Constituent Assembly was elected did the Bolsheviks dissolve the Constituent Assembly?,2,1,nabert,f63388406b15677686addd1f82abac5b,How many months before the Red Terror was started did Bolsheviks dissolve the Constituent Assembly?,8,2,naqanet,1c77c34940b37669e50b65e86fd963ed,How many months before the Red Terror was started did Bolsheviks dissolve the Constituent Assembly?,8,4,nabert,76724051a4b5aad1f391855df77adab5,How many months did the Constituent Assembly last?,2,1,nabert,f8a095523cc7c773064368597db4847a,How many more mandatory delegates did the Socialist Revolutionaries propse than the Bolshevik Central Committee did?,32,19,naqanet,76b24dc64db1cf2cf3aecfcd8920568c,How many total mandatory delegates were proposed by both the Bolshevik Central Committee and the Socialist Revolutionaries?,84,33.0,nabert,ae08f4fe3a3aba1a0157fdcecb7ed65d,How many total of the mandatory candidates were women?,8,33.0,nabert,1ed650531f19e56434798f44b28e0901,How many total of the mandatory candidates were women?,8,84,naqanet,9fe2c75c2c42aac91b4128ba8c2d941d,How many women were mandatory candidates in the Constituent Assembly elections?,8,19.0,nabert,b66016318bca175d929584ebce5621db,How many women were mandatory candidates in the Constituent Assembly elections?,8,84,naqanet,4c5dec5a623df7b3092f7053355b7d57,"Which event happened first, the Constituent Assembly being elected, or the elimination of hierarchy in the army?",Constituent Assembly being elected,Constituent Assembly was elected,naqanet,1357344bed090dcae5082c41b3e9158e,"Which event happened first, the start of the Red Terror, or the failed assassination attempt on Lenin's life?",failed assassination attempt,Red Terror,naqanet,8d6b944dcbb83e63810a62027a5ba7c8,"Which happened first, the failed assassination attempt on Lenin, or the Red Terror?",failed assassination attempt on Lenin,failed assassination attempt,naqanet,cbb3e4bd376b0e2b76830df38a049547,Which party did not have a majority after the election?,the Bolsheviks,Socialist Revolutionary Party,naqanet,17468c9c056516da7acec661dc574199,"Who proposed more delegates in the elections for a Constituent Assembly, the Bolshevik Central Committee or the Socialist Revolutionaries?",Socialist Revolutionaries,Bolshevik Central Committee or the Socialist Revolutionaries,naqanet,b1e71e200fb8f9c92c28c4ccc6b5d8a9,"Who proposed more mandatory delegates, the Bolshevik Central Committee or the Socialist Revolutionaries?",Socialist Revolutionaries,Bolshevik Central Committee,naqanet,a460e84776606b72cca1486999fb3693
"On 15 December 1773, he was commissioned as Ensign in the 14th Regiment of Foot. On 28 March 1774, he joined his first regiment, moving to quarters in Dover on 13 May 1774. In March 1775, he left for America, where, on 25 August 1775, he was appointed Lieutenant in the 14th Regiment of Foot. By 28 November 1778, he had returned to St Georges, Hanover Square, London, where he married Anne Breynton ( 1756 - 15 August 1829), the daughter of the famous minister in Nova Scotia, Rev Dr John Breynton ( 1719-1799). In 1790, he bought Elmhurst Hall and various other properties in Staffordshire, while still maintaining a house in London. In 1794 he raised the Staffordshire Yeomanry (Queens Own Royal Regiment) and became its Major and subsequently Colonel. In 1797, he tried to sell off his Staffordshire estates. The following year 1798 he raised the Staffordshire Yeomanry Infantry.

"On 16 February 1525, 25 villages belonging to the city of Memmingen rebelled, demanding of the magistrates  improvements in their economic condition and the general political situation. They complained of peonage, land use, easements on the woods and the commons as well as ecclesiastical requirements of service and payment. The city set up a committee of villagers to discuss their issues, expecting to see a checklist of specific and trivial demands. Unexpectedly, the peasants delivered a uniform declaration that struck at the pillars of the peasant-magisterial relationship. Twelve articles clearly and consistently outlined their grievances. The council rejected many of the demands. Historians have generally concluded that the articles of Memmingen became the basis for the Twelve Articles agreed on by the Upper Swabian Peasants Confederation of 20 March 1525. A single Swabian contingent, close to 200 horse and 1,000 foot soldiers, however, could not deal with the size of the disturbance. By 1525, the uprisings in the Black Forest, the Breisgau, Hegau, Sundgau, and Alsace alone required a substantial muster of 3,000 foot and 300 horse soldiers.",60c54289cbb9051a1ae080dc9f69b14a,How many areas were there uprisings in by 1525?,5,3,naqanet,234ad34079f37c057372a1c61b010f46,How many areas were there uprisings in by 1525?,5,4,nabert,be792332402dada5de006de6f0d78ee3,How many days after 25 villages belonging to the city of Memmingen rebelled were the Twelve Articles agreed on by the Upper Swabian Peasants Confederation?,32,4,naqanet,4c9e3e3b19422e8dfeedaca35657437d,How many days passed between the 25 villages of Memmingen rebelling and the Upper Swabian Peasants Confederation?,32,4,naqanet,43d47f67da74b66686ecd0d632735609,How many horse soldiers made up the Swabian contegent to control uprisings in villages in February 1525?,200,500,naqanet,e1b37c4312f248d3f91c088be374cb01,How many minimum horse soldiers and foot soldiers weren't able to deal with the disturbance?,1200,0,naqanet,5b9275a8bc4d93980ff9b5c1431f3221,How many minimum horse soldiers and foot soldiers weren't able to deal with the disturbance?,1200,500.0,nabert,1de5dfd75a339735e4f860b530ac4b86,How many months after 25 villages belonging to Memmingen rebelled were the Twelve Articles agreed on by the Upper Swabian Peasants Confederation?,1,2,naqanet,dcb02bbc765fb88834098b0457ebba35,How many months passed between the rebellion by the villages of Memmingen and the Twelve Articles agreed on?,1,2,naqanet,2f02ea880a2f209ccbd7b48af4e68699,How many more foot soldiers than horse soldiers were required to handle the uprisings in 1525?,2700,-300,naqanet,8fa6026b04ef0af1ad09a2ab287eb4bd,How many more foot soldiers than horses did the Swabian contingent have?,800,1000,naqanet,ac918d5086e77c4bb5021b2bb51a6a21,How many more foot soldiers than horses did the Swabian contingent have?,800,2800.0,nabert,e4b479692e89bef5141deda68d87f803,How many more foot soldiers were needed than horse soldiers by 1525?,2700,700,naqanet,ea2ff176df2c1af5ec11fdb789287260,How many places were uprisings held in 1525?,25,3,naqanet,2caa7a2736189eb33d25598ee7fed84f,How many places were uprisings held in 1525?,25,4,nabert,2270be0553c34d7ffed40035d0784174,The articles of Memmingen were the base of what?,the Twelve Articles,twelve articles clearly,nabert,f4f74167de0f24d0d1cbeaf58484306d,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

Local engagements broke out in the town and the surrounding area between 22 April and 1 May 1918 as several thousand western Red Guards and Red civilian refugees tried to push through on their way to Russia.

"On 19 June 2015, Oshkosh Defense announced the U.S. Army had awarded the company a five-year requirements contract worth a potential $780 million to Recapitalize (Recap) its Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (FHTV). The FHTV 4 contract covers an estimated 1,800 FHTVs and in addition to HEMTTs covers PLS trucks and also includes the production of approximately 1,000 new production PLS trailers. HEMTT models account for around 75 per cent of the Recap potential, and all work performed under the contract will be completed in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Deliveries will run from 2015 to 2019. In March 2016, Oshkosh received FHTV 4 awards valued at $430 million and covering the Recap of 1212 HEMTTs and PLS, plus the production of 345 new-build PLS trailers. Deliveries are slated for 2016-2017. In April 2017, Oshkosh announced further FHTV 4 awards valued at more than $258 million for the Recap of 670 FHTVs plus the production of 356 PLS trailers. Deliveries commence in December 2017. The most recent FHTV-4 award was announced by Oshkosh on 23 May 2018, this valued at $235.2 million for the Recap of 410 FHTVs and the manufacture of 680 new PLS trailers.

"On 2 April, 2014, a kidnap gang believed to originate from Abu Sayyaf militants raided Singamata Reef Resort off Semporna. Chinese tourist Gao Huayun from Shanghai and Filipino resort worker Marcy Dayawan were abducted and taken to the Sulu Archipelago. The two hostages were later rescued after a collaboration between Malaysian and Philippines security forces. On 6 May, five Abu Sayyaf gunmen raided a Malaysian fish farm on Baik Island Sabah, kidnapped the fish farm manager and took him to Jolo island. He was freed in July with the help of Malaysian negotiators. On 16 June, two gunmen believed to be from Abu Sayyaf kidnapped a Chinese fish farm manager and one Filipino worker in Kampung Air Sapang. The worker managed to escape and disappeared. Meanwhile, the fish farm manager was taken to Jolo. He was released on 10 December. Malaysian authorities identified five Filipinos, the ""Muktadil brothers"", as responsible for these cases. They sold their hostages to the Abu Sayyaf group. Of the five Muktadil brothers: Mindas Muktadil was killed by Philippine police in May 2015, Kadafi Muktadil was arrested in late 2015, Nixon Muktadil and Brown Muktadil were killed by the Philippine military on 27 September 2016 after they resisted arrest, while Badong Muktadil succumbed to his injuries while fleeing after he was shot when his brothers was killed.

"On 26 October 1591, the Portuguese, led by André Furtado, mounted a military campaign against the Jaffna kingdom from Mannar. The forces consisted of 1,400 Portuguese soldiers and 3,000 Lascarins, who sailed with 43 ships and more than 200 small vessels. Jaffna forces were expecting the arrival in Kayts, but the fleet landed in Colombuthurai. With the support of heavy firepower, the first wave of 150 Portuguese soldiers and 200 Lascarins reached land. The first-wave attack favoured the Portuguese, who managed to kill the enemy soldiers and captured two pieces of artillery, more than 300 muskets, various other weapons, and ammunition. The second wave, comprising 400 Portuguese soldiers, reached land, followed by the rest of the soldiers, who captured a storehouse and stationed at night. The next day, the Portuguese forces marched toward the capital and faced a defensive attack led by Prince Gago, son-in-law of Puvirasa Pandaram. Gago was killed in action and his entire company was wiped out. Advancing forces faced another ferocious defensive attack between the Nallur Kandaswamy temple and the Nallur Weerakaliyamman temple. Prince Ethirimana Cinkam was wounded and was about to be executed by the invading forces, but was saved by a captain, Simão Pinhão. The Portuguese army captured the king when he tried to escape into a temple. André Furtado ordered the king's execution by beheading. His head was then placed on a pike and kept on display for several days. The palace was sacked and the king's entire family was taken captive. Eight hundred Badagas and some Moors of Kozhikode were beheaded, as they were considered enemies. All the vessels in the port were burnt except two vessels for the use of the king. Three ships, 100 Portuguese soldiers, and 200 Lascarins were stationed in Jaffna at the request of the new king.",4bc186203318c7ee37fb5fc2459b5942,About how many soldiers did the military campaign start with?,4400,1400,naqanet,c7a289f5843a1c41e54b1eec950f9c22,About how many soldiers did the military campaign start with?,4400,1500.0,nabert,8728f240d7f4232e5b46443d9254b90a,At least how many ships did Furtado sail with?,43,243,naqanet,0d99b7e11546efd5acaf717bad80dcc6,How many soldiers were in the first wave to reach land?,350,550.0,nabert,1da4cad2b436194eee692f7ab161cf5a,How many total men fought for the Portuguese?,1400,1500.0,nabert,cda1ae520f1b50db313b450e0725c887,How many total men fought for the Portuguese?,1400,1550,naqanet,3c1ce6bcce39412d5d916aff3d69ef1f,How many total soldiers were led by Andre Furtado?,4400,1500.0,nabert,40a7173543edc8d1fdae5ffa7beafb6b,How many total soldiers were led by Andre Furtado?,4400,1800,naqanet,2219076e8692cfa50b6d0c33e0d9736f,In the first wave attack were there more Portuguese soldiers or Lascarins?,Lascarins,Portuguese soldiers,naqanet,b53d3b76119f9669c793563844e751fa,"Which event happend first, Prince Ethirimana Cinkam being wounded, or Simão Pinhão saving Prince Ethirimana Cinkam?",Prince Ethirimana Cinkam being wounded,Prince Ethirimana Cinkam was wounded,naqanet,94303d4d31ed4d6dd3ac30a82fbeedfa,"Which event happened first, the military campaign against the Jaffna, or the death of Gago?",military campaign against the Jaffna,military campaign against the jaffna kingdom,nabert,d33d2d82b66c54f5bc5c70df5a9ff504,"Which wave had fewer soldiers total, the first or second?",first wave,second,naqanet,d9ff60c38ebe9aa5adadebaaab2c1a3a,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"On 31 August, 2000, American citizen and Muslim convert Jeffrey Schilling from Oakland, California was captured on Jolo while visiting a terrorist camp with his new wife, Ivy Osani , whom he had met online. ASG demanded a $10 million ransom. Rebels also sarcastically threatened to behead him in 2001 as a ""birthday present"" to then Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who responded by declaring ""all-out war"" on them. The beheading threat was withdrawn after Schilling's mother, Carol, flew to the Philippines and appealed for mercy on local radio. On 12 April, 2001, Philippine soldiers raided a rebel camp and rescued the American. The United States praised the Philippine government for freeing Schilling. Many commentators have been critical of Schilling, who claims to have walked willingly into the camp after he was invited by his wife's cousin, a member of Abu Sayyaf. Schilling was one of more than forty hostages taken by Abu Sayyaf in 2000, including twenty-one tourists and workers seized in a raid on Sipadan diving resort in neighbouring Malaysia. Many of the hostages were released after Libya paid millions of dollars. A Libyan official stated that Schilling had visited the Jolo camp often before his capture. Philippine intelligence sources say he was interested in selling military equipment to the rebels, while the bandits accused him of being a CIA agent. Abu Sayyaf threatened several times to kill Schilling. At one stage, Schilling reportedly went on a hunger strike to win his freedom.",7e077b89e79f423946cd348392e22e66,How many months was the American held captive?,8,2,naqanet,8bea141b8347e4c30e4d2b9d4d36b609,How many months was the American held captive?,8,4,nabert,3a64dfa357d8ce34b8b30f467addeaa5,What date were 21 tourists taken hostage by Abu Sayyaf?,2000,0,naqanet,5f467c32a88ea97d3735628e8c412ab1,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"On 31 December 1543, Henry and Charles had signed a treaty pledging to invade France in person by 20 June 1544; each was to provide an army of no less than 35,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry for the venture. Against this Francis could muster about 70,000 men in his various armies. The campaign could not begin, however, until Henry and Charles had resolved their personal conflicts with Scotland and the German princes, respectively. On 15 May, Henry was informed by Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, that, after his raids, Scotland was no longer in a position to threaten him; he then began to make preparations for a personal campaign in France—against the advice of his council and the Emperor, who believed that his presence would be a hindrance. Charles had meanwhile reached an understanding with the princes at the Diet of Speyer, and the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg had agreed to join his invasion of France. By May 1544, two Imperial armies were poised to invade France: one, under Ferrante Gonzaga, Viceroy of Sicily, north of Luxemburg; the other, under Charles himself, in the Palatinate. Charles had gathered a combined force of more than 42,000 for the invasion, and had arranged for another 4,000 men to join the English army. On 25 May, Gonzaga captured Luxembourg and moved towards Commercy and Ligny, issuing a proclamation that the Emperor had come to overthrow ""a tyrant allied to the Turks"". On 8 July, Gonzaga besieged Saint-Dizier; Charles and the second Imperial army soon joined him.",68f9d3e3786c1e65b54f762cbe9665fc,How many combined cavalry did Henry and Charles pledge in the treaty?,14000,49000.0,nabert,c089042dd681f183b6cd48e700e44676,How many combined cavalry did Henry and Charles pledge in the treaty?,14000,7000,naqanet,29a22aed3cd6c041a3c7f7e66f0a5fb0,How many combined infantry did Henry and Charles pledge in the treaty?,70000,39000.0,nabert,bb5319a1b1b8b39f557e783a8ef21e35,How many combined infantry did Henry and Charles pledge in the treaty?,70000,77000,naqanet,df4d7c51d5b76470247e2f7fc9500247,How many days after Henry and Charles agreed to sign a treaty to invade France was the invasion of France to happen?,171,11,naqanet,3f184095a1ba5eb379d6e4ba68f0a9bd,How many days after Henry and Charles agreed to sign a treaty to invade France was the invasion of France to happen?,171,18.0,nabert,fad50e280a4e203285c81a47928a3550,How many months after Henry and Charles signed a treaty did they pledge to invade France in person?,6,2,naqanet,776e04414d1251b74b03ccaad27808ca,How many months after signing the treaty to invade France did teo armies prepare to invade France?,6,2,naqanet,454173af58d69d4cd76b78ea0703af98,How many months after signing the treaty to invade France did teo armies prepare to invade France?,6,3,nabert,d0df6a971293728aceb337ea2e4ab3e6,How many months after the Imperial armieswere ready to invade France did Gonzaga capture Luxembourg?,1,2,naqanet,d63b025ad8b3f7beda7a1b2d537fdaca,"How many months elapsed between the treaty between Henry and Charles, and the capture of Luxembourg?",5,2,naqanet,c119bb264d2c0086831d062a26f93894,How many troops did Charles in provide in May 1544?,42000,35000,naqanet,0cfdd6621e2d33ba268fe6d4d4ca36a0,How many troops did Charles in provide in May 1544?,42000,49000.0,nabert,238509038bcd695fb8592023a2e57d3f,"How many troops did Henry and Charles agree to provide, combined, at minimum?",42000,46000,naqanet,9fb0a9aa4ad41fff1f241b8603572362,"How many troops did Henry and Charles agree to provide, combined, at minimum?",42000,49000.0,nabert,b6cddbce312fe88799e1d1570a5a4d27,"Which did Gonzaga capture first, Saint-Dizier or Luxembourg?",Luxembourg,Saint-Dizier,naqanet,9d5419bc5f6b931fcb60b20ea6e37d91,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"On 7-8 October at the Battle of Slobodyshche 14,000-15,000 Poles and 5,000-6,000 Tatars defeated the Cossacks under Yurii Khmelnytsky, who was trying to link up with Sheremetev. After the unsuccessful battle Yurii began talks with the Poles. As a result, he broke the alliance with Moscow and 17 October signed Slobodischensky Tacktat, under which the Hetmanate rejoined the Commonwealth. After learning of this switch, Tsetsyura and his Cossacks, who were with Sheremetev, also changed sides . This left Sheremetev, who was defending Chudnov in a dangerous position. At the Battle of Chudnov the Poles defeated the Russians . The fortified Russo-Cossack camp was completely encircled. During the battle Tsetsyura went over to the royal army with 2,000 Cossacks.

After the unsuccessful battle Yurii began talks with the Poles. As a result, he broke the alliance with Moscow and 17 October signed Slobodischensky Tacktat, under which the Hetmanate rejoined the Commonwealth. After learning of this switch, Tsetsyura and his Cossacks, who were with Sheremetev, also changed sides . This left Sheremetev, who was defending Chudnov in a dangerous position. At the Battle of Chudnov the Poles defeated the Russians . The fortified Russo-Cossack camp was completely encircled. During the battle Tsetsyura went over to the royal army with 2,000 Cossacks.

"On January 31, 2015, the Hawks became the first NBA team to go 17–0 in a calendar month by beating Portland. The 2015 All-Star Game consisted of four Hawks All-Stars including Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver and Al Horford. On March 9, 2015, Kyle Korver and DeMarre Carroll each scored 20 points to help the Hawks become the first NBA team to 50 wins in 2014–15, scoring a season-high in routing the Sacramento Kings 130-105. The Hawks also set a franchise record by going 20-of-36 for three-pointers, breaking the mark of 19 set against the Dallas Mavericks on December 17, 1996. On March 20, 2015, the Hawks clinched their first division title in over two decades and became the first team not based in Florida to win the NBAs Southeast Division (NBA); one week later, with a win over Miami as well as a Cleveland loss to Brooklyn, the Hawks clinched the top seed in the 2015 NBA Playoffs.

"On October 8, the Chiefs traveled to Glendale, Arizona for their first game in the University of Phoenix Stadium to face the Arizona Cardinals.  Trent Green was still recovering from his concussion, and Arizona's rookie quarterback Matt Leinart made his career start.  The game was broadcast on CBS 1:15pm Arizona time. The game began with Arizona's offense dominating and catching the Chiefs' defense off-guard with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, putting the Cardinals on the scoreboard within three minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, Dante Hall was injured and left the game,  leaving rookie Jeff Webb to return the kicks for the rest of the game, including a 56-yard punt return.  Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.  Johnson recovered and received a standing ovation.  The NFL fined Rolle $12,500 for his penalty.  It was the second time in the 2006 season in which Rolle had been fined for an illegal tackle.  The play set up Lawrence Tynes' eventual game-winning field goal, leaving the Chiefs with the 23-20 lead. Neil Rackers set up for a kick with less than 15&#160;seconds to play in order to send the 23-20 contest into overtime.

"One week later, Dallas faced the 1993 San Francisco 49ers season in the NFC Championship Game for the second year in a row in what was, at the time, the last NFL game to air on CBS.  The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys.  The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.  But this time, the game was extremely one-sided.  The Cowboys scored touchdowns on four of their five first-half possessions.  By the end of the half, Dallas had a commanding 28-7 lead.  Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes for 177 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, while also rushing for 25 yards, but was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter.  Then San Francisco scored a touchdown, making the score 28-14 with plenty of time left for a comeback.  However, their hopes were soon dashed as backup quarterback Bernie Kosar, who had already played in three conference championship games and was unable to advance to the Super Bowl each time, led the Cowboys 82 yards to go up 35-14 on his 42-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Harper.  Murray then put the finishing touches on San Francisco with a 50-yard field goal, while all the 49ers could do was score a useless touchdown in ""garbage time"" to make the final score 38-21.  Smith rushed for 88 yards, caught seven passes for 85 yards, and scored two touchdowns.

"Over the next year, however, the Polish forces were subject to attrition, as the Sejm again refused to raise taxes and pay the army, resulting in mass desertions of unpaid soldiery. The Polish problems were further aggravated by the incompetent leadership of hetman Michał Kazimierz Pac, who obstructed Sobieski's leadership, while the Ottomans continued to receive reinforcements. Nonetheless in 1674 the Commonwealth resumed the offensive, taking advantage of a new Muscovy-Ottoman conflict that year, and the Polish-Ottoman war remained undecided.:275 Sobieski's force of 6,000 defeated 20,000 Turks and Tatars under Ibrahim Shyshman in the battle of Lwow in August 1675.:653  Even after the Battle of Trembowla, the Sejm still refused his pleas for more funds and a larger army.:653 In 1676, after Sobieski's 16,000 withstood the two-week siege of Żurawno, by 100,000 men under Ibrahim Pasha, a new peace treaty was signed, the Treaty of Żurawno.:655  The peace treaty partially reversing those from Buczacz: the Ottomans kept approximately two thirds of the territories they gained in 1672, and the Commonwealth no longer was obliged to pay any kind of tribute to the Empire; a large number of Polish prisoners were released by the Ottomans.",810af8f514b19ed8845dccb10d98fc5b,How many more forces were under the Turks than in Sobieski's forces?,6000,14000,naqanet,d293f2f1ae2d1f007289663ebe3074b2,How many more men did Sobieski's force have compared to Turks and Tatars in the battle of Lwow?,14000,-4000.0,nabert,32d9ba54eb14135faa3a14abf028c21a,How many soldiers did Ibrahim Shyshman's force outnumber Sobieski's forces by?,14000,80000.0,nabert,0c02470dabd6a29a7699f92347d335f6,How many was the difference beween Sobieski's force and the Turks and Tatars?,14000,-14000.0,nabert,018d08f05a6a94582a3f2c5cf60265b6,How many years was it between the Ottoman territory gain and when the Commonwealth resumed the offensive?,2,-2,naqanet,4386f72c5fcf94a6ab852742ae5e5bc2,"What happened first, the battle of Lwow or the Treaty of Żurawno?","the battle of Lwow in August 1675.

"Paraguay has a small tourism industry. Total tourism receipts declined annually from 2000 through 2002. In 2003 Paraguay's hotel occupancy rate was 38 percent. It increased by 15 percent in 2004. Small gains in tourism have come from business rather than leisure travellers. For many years, Paraguay served as a central market for trafficable, duty-free goods. However, crackdowns by the governments of Brazil and Argentina have stemmed the flow of shoppers travelling to Paraguay looking for trafficable items. Paraguay is a country that has a lot of different activities for tourism, due to privileged weather and location conditions condensed into a varied geography, an inviting ""warm"" tropical climate and an  interesting history and unmatched folk art that adorn its streets with an identity that enchants anyone who visits the country. As an example, for less than 80 US dollars a visitor can have a personalized trip to a nature reserve area called Eco-Reserva Mbatovi which is located in the Paraguari department, about an hour away from the capital. The trip includes a bunch of different outdoor activities, water, and complete professional guidance during the whole trip.",b8647ff45aece334a2b8ca6dd6c176c2,How many percent would the Paraguay's total be in 2004 if it increased 15 percent from 38 from the year before?,53,23,naqanet,4d50df032b902849469ccee92288ddc7,How many percentage points was Paraguay's hotel occupancy rate in 2004?,53,23,naqanet,9609fc004c24b1341bb257b782f61951,How many years did these events span?,4,2,naqanet,adc32ef7d158307bb1708e267bb17773,"In which year was Paraguay's hotel occupancy rate higher, 2003 or 2004?",2004,2003,naqanet,4bb4663af61d01624e46003a47fab310,Was Paraguay's hotel occupancy rate higher in 2003 or 2004?,2004,2003,naqanet,41fbcf38a2d02e0694aefb366cc3d562,"What happened first, the tourism declined, or Paraguay's hotel occupanacy rate increased?",tourism receipts declined,Paraguay's hotel occupancy rate,naqanet,81fce2a14740fd783506d8f513dfcbf0,"What happened first, the tourism declined, or Paraguay's hotel occupanacy rate increased?",tourism receipts declined,paraguay ' s hotel occupancy rate,nabert,4aa602b4a13e966fe95edacaaf9d0bf8,What type of tourism is responsible for the overall tourism growth in Paraguay?,business,weather,naqanet,a13d114d3739eadbf4e1e991b295640b,When did Paraguay's tourism receipts begin to decline?,2000,2002,naqanet,3ee1bfe74472e1585d9ff55168ca1d12,"Which year did  was Paraguay's hotel occupancy better, 2003 or 2004?",2004,2003,nabert,970bd47f08c5af0a40a31ae0b85285a3,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Peele was christened on 25 July 1556 at St James Garlickhythe in the City of London. His father, James Peele (d. Dec 30, 1585), who appears to have belonged to a Devonshire family, was clerk of Christs Hospital, a school which was then situated in central London, and wrote two treatises on bookkeeping, The Maner and Fourme How to Kepe a Perfecte Reconyng (1553) and The Pathe Waye to Perfectnes (1569). The latter depicts James Peele in a woodcut on the title page. No contemporary likeness of George is known, although he was said to be short-legged, dark complected, red haired, and squinting, although not necessarily from reliable sources. Georges mother, Anne, died July 1, 1580, and his father married Christian Widers (d. 1597 in St. Christopher le Stocks) on November 3, 1580. She became a nurse on the Hospital payroll, where she remained five years after James Peeles death, when she married Ralph Boswell. His siblings included Anne (d. Jan 10, 1568/9),  Isabel, Judith (d. Apr. 16, 1582), and James (b. Jan 3, 1563/4).  Anne married John Alford on May 14, 1565, and had one son, Robert (October 9, 1567- c. March 12, 1654/5). Judith married John Jackman on June 19, 1575, and had three children, Susan (b. June 3, 1576), William (April 30, 1577-July 1, 1577), and Sarah (d. May 24, 1578). On Feb. 5, 1568/9, Isabel married Mathew Shakespeare, with whom she had eight children.  Many scholars believe that this was a cousin of William Shakespeare, but this has not been verified. James Peele also wrote the Ironmongers Pageants of 1566 and 1569, which may have led to Georges writing of two Lord Mayors pageants.",1c2b513be4a4dae5b025285386cb3d95,How many months after the death of his wife Anne did James marry Christian Widers?,4,2,naqanet,590c4d529e5dd3852a057c9f7360770c,How many months after the death of his wife Anne did James marry Christian Widers?,4,7,nabert,4fe5f12bc234ab7c473b5498ba240418,How many years after Anne's marriage to John Alford was their son Robert born?,2,-1565,naqanet,707342fcc8fab02c68ec22266dc2a9e3,How many years after Anne's marriage to John Alford was their son Robert born?,2,17.0,nabert,fffe9e048054a6ba80a6a16d0300c4e9,How many years after her marriage to James Peele did Christian Widers die?,17,41,naqanet,99d854ee79a1b10c779fae20b5133cef,How many years after her marriage to Ralph Boswell did Christian Widers die?,7,17,naqanet,cf8614314ab4da213bb77bca01894773,In what year did Christian Widers marry Ralph Boswell?,1590,1575.0,nabert,1f6690803941763591419540dc99f61b,In what year did Christian Widers marry Ralph Boswell?,1590,1580,naqanet,235045e7fbe2ed896c243a6020ec9388,In what year were Jame's Peele's treatises on bookkeeping published?,1553 1569,0,naqanet,82d8017d455ba8a99799b3299b5abafc,In what year were Jame's Peele's treatises on bookkeeping published?,1553 1569,1557.0,nabert,36d608eaf8a2f8c132dd3335cbb79723,Who was Anne's son?,George,Christian Widers,naqanet,b5251f4d4a93ae249f34732e1e85ee6d,Who was Anne's son?,George,robert,nabert,4efd06f259f6326e8838adf647bddc4f,Who was James Peele's son?,George,James Garlickhythe,naqanet,ac03ddb3357d0cd97cc61f744b0e0ea5,Who was James Peele's son?,George,robert,nabert,6fa35a9ea8675da7d7e9ab1e384f5604,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Playing on Sunday night for the first time all season, the Giants could not take advantage of three Vince Young interceptions and fumbled on their final drive, allowing the Eagles to salvage a split in the season series. New York fell behind 10-0 on an Alex Henery field goal and a touchdown pass from Young to former Giant Steve Smith. Trailing 10-3 entering the fourth, Eli Manning sought out Victor Cruz who caught a pass for 24 yards and the tying touchdown. However, they allowed Young to put together an 18-play drive finishing with a Riley Cooper touchdown pass. The Giants got the ball and Manning completed a pass to Cruz for 47 yards. The next play, Manning was stripped of the ball, sealing the Eagles victory. Despite his three interceptions Young threw for 258 yards in his relief effort for the injured Michael Vick.

"Polin succeeded ambassador Antoine de Rincon  in Constantinople. In early 1542, Polin successfully negotiated the details of a Franco-Ottoman alliance for the Italian War of 1542-1546, with the Ottoman Empire promising to send 27,500 troops against the territories of the Spanish king Ferdinand, as well as 110 galleys against Charles, while France promised to attack Flanders, harass the coasts of Spain with a naval force, and send 40 galleys to assist the Turks for operations in the Levant. Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543. In July 1543, Polin sailed on board the Ottoman fleet of Barbarossa to the Île Saint-Honorat in the Lérins Islands off Cannes on 5 July 1543, only to find very little ready for the offensive on the French side. Polin went to see king Francis I of France to obtain troops, which led to the Siege of Nice in August 1543.

"Quarrels between Denmark and Sweden led to the Northern Seven Years' War in 1563, which ended in 1570 with the Treaty of Stettin. Primarily fought in western and southern Scandinavia, the war involved important naval battles fought in the Baltic. When Danish-held Varberg surrendered to Swedish forces in 1565, 150 Danish mercenaries escaped the subsequent massacre of the garrison by defecting to Sweden. Among them was Pontus de la Gardie, who thereafter became an important Swedish commander in the Livonian War. Livonia was also affected by the naval campaign of Danish admiral Peter or Per Munck, who bombarded Swedish Reval from sea in July 1569. The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark the supreme and dominating power in Northern Europe, yet failed to restore the Kalmar Union. Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led to a series of conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored, and thus the Livonian War continued. From Ivan's point of view, the treaty enabled the powers involved to form an alliance against him, now that they were no longer fighting each other.",5d461adc7a5941ecd1406140194d0fa7,How many years after Varberg surrendered did the war end?,5,155,naqanet,8ae7b21a0c3ff5814dc3721345ca2b3d,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Refusing the title of king, Mirwais was called ""Prince of Qandahár and General of the national troops"" by his Afghan countrymen. He died peacefully in November 1715 from natural causes and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz; the latter was murdered later by Mirwais' son Mahmud. In 1720, Mahmud's Afghan forces crossed the deserts of Sistan and captured Kerman. His plan was to conquer the Persian capital, Isfahan. After defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Gulnabad on March 8, 1722, he proceeded to and besieged Isfahan for 6 months, after which it fell. On October 23, 1722, Sultan Husayn abdicated and acknowledged Mahmud as the new Shah of Persia. The majority of the Persian people, however, rejected the Afghan regime as usurpers from the start. For the next seven years until 1729, the Hotaks were the de facto rulers of most of Persia, and the southern and eastern areas of Afghanistan still remained under their control until 1738. The Hotak dynasty was a troubled and violent one from the very start as internecine conflict made it difficult to establish permanent control. The dynasty lived under great turmoil due to bloody succession feuds that made their hold on power tenuous, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan - including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family - the Hotak dynasty was eventually removed from power in Persia. On the other hand, the Afghans had also been suppressed by the Iranian Safavid government represented by its governor Gurgin Khan before their uprising in 1709.",f02d382436e44b2669f26ff9a38be8b4,How did Abdul Aziz die?,murdered,brother,naqanet,c7352610ebfaf6247f80cbe9eab5dde2,How did Abdul Aziz die?,murdered,from natural causes,nabert,4d7ae812b58c76a0981c536e350a5586,How many years did the Hotaks rule,7,1729,naqanet,93fff049a0115c9527e1f6dd22b9e21f,How many years did the Hotaks rule,7,9.0,nabert,deeb10c7d63389b5d53aa518803eb66a,What did Mirwais die of?,natural causes,Refusing,naqanet,575033ca4855f0204309297a48b610e1,What two major events occurred in 1722 in Afghanistan?,Battle of Gulnabad Sultan Husayn abdicated,besieged Isfahan,naqanet,34f1f6fac0acff97a2f7015b8eb16a91,What two major events occurred in 1722 in Afghanistan?,Battle of Gulnabad Sultan Husayn abdicated,"october 23 , 1722 , sultan husayn abdicated and acknowledged mahmud as the new shah of persia",nabert,c16a283e2940e8d21c8145b83ce92c80,What year did the the Hotaks the de facto rulers of most of Persia?,1722,-7,naqanet,89ec37c7476f66be8f9c98b898d9cc19,What year did the the Hotaks the de facto rulers of most of Persia?,1722,1736.0,nabert,917890f418bae7f9ef1f0381fba5ecd6,Who did Mahmud murder?,Abdul Aziz,Sultan Husayn,naqanet,ca6b82c5c084d7a729581f664a618c1e,"Who gained control of the Persian throne on October 23rd, 1722?",Mahmud,Sultan Husayn,naqanet,313f83985a65d6345f19d22d09b178f8,"Who gained control of the Persian throne on October 23rd, 1722?",Mahmud,sultan husayn abdicated and acknowledged mahmud as the new shah of persia,nabert,35ef0d065db6472bbcf6abf666dc708c,Who took over for Mirwais,Abdul Aziz,Sultan Husayn,naqanet,30401a0b2d37268f8a5ac5c39a800fec,Who was Abdul Aziz's brother?,Mirwais,Mahmud,naqanet,ec1bb177574c6615b807f69a1b64a8e0,Who was Mahmud's uncle?,Abdul Aziz,Sultan Husayn,naqanet,e48a37c66a49b1b27e2a5be082a955e4,Who was Mahmud's uncle?,Abdul Aziz,mirwais,nabert,bf6428afa148001b06632615547ad65a,Who was succeeded by Abdul Aziz?,Mirwais,son Mahmud,naqanet,0346696e1082a84356c24b269579d3c5,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Russia accused Georgia of committing ""genocide"" in South Ossetia. Russian officials initially claimed that up to 2,000 ethnic Ossetian civilians of Tskhinvali were killed by Georgian forces; according to Russia, the reason for the military intervention in Georgia was this large number of casualties. Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties; according to HRW, some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the ""thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia"" reported by Russian television. In December 2008, the figures were revised down to a total of 162 South Ossetian casualties by the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. Georgia and South Ossetia have filed complaints about alleged war crimes committed by the other side with international courts, including the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights. The war displaced a 192,000 people including both Ossetians and Georgians. Many were able to return to their homes after the war, but a year later around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced.

"Russia admitted that three of its Su-25 strike aircraft and one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber were lost. Georgia at that time claimed it had downed at least 21 Russian aircraft. Moscow Defence Brief provided a higher estimate for air force losses, saying that Russian Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, one Su-24M Fencer fighter-bomber, one Su-24MR Fencer E reconnaissance plane and four Su-25 attack planes. Anton Lavrov listed one Su-25SM, two Su-25BM, two Su-24M and one Tu-22M3 lost. Two helicopters, a Mi-8MTKO and a Mi-24, were wrecked in an accident after the hostilities. While there are no official figures, Russian ground equipment losses in the war are estimated to be three tanks, at least 20 armoured and 32 non-armoured vehicles lost in combat. Several more vehicles were impaired in accidents. During one engagement, Georgian forces destroyed 25 out of 30 vehicles of a Russian military unit commanded by General Anatoly Khrulyov. The Russian military had no losses in the artillery, air defence and naval forces. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, the five-day war cost Russia an estimated 12.5 billion rubles, a daily cost of 2.5 billion rubles.

"Salks vaccine was then used in a test called the Francis Field Trial, led by Thomas Francis, Jr., the largest medical experiment in history at that time. The test began with about 4,000 children at Franklin Sherman Elementary School in McLean, Virginia, and eventually involved 1.8 million children, in 44 states from Maine to California. By the conclusion of the study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections of the vaccine, about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group, who would then be observed to see if any contracted polio. The results of the field trial were announced 12 April 1955 (the tenth anniversary of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose Franklin D. Roosevelts paralytic illness was generally believed to have been caused by polio). The Salk vaccine had been 60-70% effective against PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% effective against PV2 and PV3, and 94% effective against the development of bulbar polio. Soon after Salks vaccine was licensed in 1955, childrens vaccination campaigns were launched. In the U.S, following a mass immunization campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 by 1957.

"Shang Zhixin was forced to commit suicide in 1680; of his thirty six brothers four were executed when he committed suicide while the rest of his family was allowed to live. Geng Jingzhong was executed; his brother Geng Juzhong 耿聚忠 was in Beijing with the Qing court with the Kangxi Emperor during the rebellion and was not punished for his brother's revolt. Geng Juzhong died of natural causes in 1687. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan , son of Zhu Yihai. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. In 1685, the Qing used former Ming loyalist Han Chinese naval specialists who had served under the Zheng family in Taiwan in the siege of Albazin. Former Ming loyalist Han Chinese troops who had served under Zheng Chenggong and who specialized at fighting with rattan shields and swords  藤牌营 were recommended to the Kangxi Emperor to reinforce Albazin against the Russians. Kangxi was impressed by a demonstration of their techniques and ordered 500 of them to defend Albazin, under Ho Yu, a former Koxinga follower, and Lin Hsing-chu, a former General of Wu Sangui. These rattan shield troops did not suffer a single casualty when they defeated and cut down Russian forces traveling by rafts on the river, only using the rattan shields and swords while fighting naked.",f96f6f1e0bcbe400c3ca9467c61c4318,How many brothers did Zhixin lose?,4,6,naqanet,1ed88be0c7fce1052b9db80bf3c99776,How many brothers died?,4,6,naqanet,06ac30ecdf6bc502a9d696604fd7aff7,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were NOT executed when he committed suicide?,32,2,naqanet,af0c68ea4a0c80d63ae7435a797b86ce,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were NOT executed when he committed suicide?,32,26.0,nabert,0590465eb4c122f3875d1876085ee7eb,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were allowed to live?,32,2,naqanet,4009d7650a414e6cf18cda834296e804,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were allowed to live?,32,26.0,nabert,09c8b11003fb69f74080d09bab919f26,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were not executed?,32,2,naqanet,5e453c1b228238207ebc3e70d3ac3e57,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were not executed?,32,3,nabert,d0b7e9e8d56eabe461032af1e381c7dc,Who ended up being quite fascinated by the Chinese troops?,Kangxi,Zheng Chenggong,naqanet,2f25b9273fa448e4c3a462839ca6c8b8,Who ended up being quite fascinated by the Chinese troops?,Kangxi,lin hsing - chu,nabert,660dd0993198cc35858bcf4ec986d8a9,"Who had been the former general of Wu Sangui, Zheng Chenggong or Lin Hsing-chu?",Lin Hsing-chu,Zheng Chenggong,naqanet,260607e67bca1fa5d9bfa30da8024eee,Who was the enemy of Ho Yu and Lin Hsing-chu?,Russians,Wu Sangui,naqanet,43d7531a6dfd3eb114c40af92a880c7b,Who were the troops ordered to defend Albazin?,Ho Yu Lin Hsing-chu,"Ho Yu, a former Koxinga follower, and Lin Hsing-chu",naqanet,951ee9c7f8d904f4b734d9505d6fb7ef,Who were the troops ordered to defend Albazin?,Ho Yu Lin Hsing-chu,lin hsing - chu,nabert,a18d2c6d44dfa247d9fe7908d21834e9,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Since 1912 the Royal Danish Navy has operated aircraft either as a functional part of the navy or as flights conducted by the Royal Danish Air Force. Aviation pioneer Robert Svendsen purchased the first aircraft, a Henry Farman, and gave it to the navy who subsequently named it Glenten . Later the same year, a private funding effort made it possible to purchase two Donnet-Leveque flying boats named Maagen  and Ternen . At the outbreak of World War One the navy had two operational flying boats and five educated pilots making it possible to make daily reconnaissance flights over the Sound, monitoring German mine-laying activities. From 1914 to 1917, the Orlogsværftet  produced eight OV-flying boats and in 1915 and 1916 two naval flying stations were established in Copenhagen and Nyborg, mainly focusing on the two international seaways Øresund and Storebælt. After the war the Danish production of aircraft was stopped due to several crashes and an international surplus of warplanes. Following British advice, five Avro 504 were purchased for training purposes and based in Ringsted between the two important straits.",e60b73dc576c08a9860fd21e86ded0c2,Did the Orlogsværftet produce more OV-flying boats or establish more naval flying stations?,produce more OV-flying boats,OV-flying boats,naqanet,64565fe14a5d73e7b4718fdfce44dfc5,Did the Royal Danish Navy have more operational flying boats or educated pilots at the outbreak of World War One?,educated pilots,operational flying boats,naqanet,9ce65fd77c6be89fb2ec71d603155ae9,How many flying stations were established in Copenhagen?,1,2,nabert,255bfcbf52a1b5779ed51e9ac0de1f8b,How many flying stations were established in Copenhagen?,1,3,naqanet,9d8cedc0e2955245ab9caa53533bf17c,How many flying stations were established in Nyborg?,1,2,nabert,bd70f5adcd62758e537ca7eedc2cf6cf,How many flying stations were established in Nyborg?,1,3,naqanet,dd2caa11eaceb07d33151330e8811d1a,How many planes did the Royal Danish Navy acquire the first year?,3,1,nabert,87e7677a3ac8ec97bc0d6e7934c2218d,How many planes did the Royal Danish Navy acquire the first year?,3,2,naqanet,1d37767360b5263a5b255c9b8bc93636,How many years after the Orlogsværftet produce began production on OV-flying boats was a naval flying station established in Copenhagen?,1,1918,naqanet,a3b289c852e62bbe943417106ad61140,How many years after the Orlogsværftet produce began production on OV-flying boats was a naval flying station established in Copenhagen?,1,3.0,nabert,518dd40bd09b4e2cdcf0d38a856288aa,How many years did it take to establish flying stations in Copenhagen and Nyborg?,1,2,nabert,5f0e3b7cf3e615070dc2a9c45d4ed27d,What year did production begin on the Orlogsværftet producing eight OV-flying boats?,1914,3.0,nabert,cd0561e854dd4ae6142166677c6182df,What years did the establishment of international seways overlap the Orlogsværftet producing OV-flying boats?,1915 and 1916,1914 to 1917,naqanet,a73042d00eea5237b932dffc0478f263,What years did the establishment of international seways overlap the Orlogsværftet producing OV-flying boats?,1915 and 1916,1917,nabert,30a7b7dc5cf99393f85d7663c4a96a67,"Which happened earlier, the purchase of a Henry Farman aircraft or the establishment of two naval flying stations by the Orlogsværftet?",purchase of a Henry Farman,purchase of a Henry Farman aircraft,naqanet,ff26da8ff4bf66810267027a22d10000,"Which happened earlier, the purchase of two Donnet-Leveque flying boats or the establishment of two naval flying stations by the Orlogsværftet?",purchase of two Donnet-Leveque,purchase of two donnet - leveque flying boats,nabert,1ed7e19778cc03bedc0ad45a912d8c85,"Which owner named the aircraft Glenten, Robert Svendsen or the navy?",the navy,Robert Svendsen or the navy,naqanet,ad5b876b03f78a3746b6a19ebed7fd69,"Which owner named the aircraft Glenten, Robert Svendsen or the navy?",the navy,robert svendsen,nabert,3cb0d876350bc4884a0f241d062abf9d,"Which were there more of, flying boats or educated pilots?",educated pilots,flying boats,nabert,49bfe8aceb17edd11f3901f96fd99132,none,none,none,none,none
"Since the 1980s, the economy has slowly become less centralized; the annual rate of GDP growth of the Federal District from 2003 to 2004 was the smallest of all federal entities at 0.2%, with drastic drops in the agriculture and industrial sectors. Nonetheless, it still accounts for 21.8% of the nations GDP. The states with the highest GDP growth rates are Quintana Roo (9.0%), Baja California (8.9%), and San Luis Potosí (8.2%). In 2000, the federal entities with the highest GDP per capita in Mexico were the Federal District (US $26,320), Campeche (US $18,900) and Nuevo León (US $30,250); the states with the lowest GDP per capita were Chiapas (US $3,302), Oaxaca (US $4,100) and Guerrero (US $6,800).",ff61e7308bf7d17feea4940c31af4b54,How many US$ are the bottom 3 states' GDP combined?,14202,5264.0,nabert,bfa65f0ffcc6ae8d08250010bee3a6de,How many US$ are the bottom 3 states' GDP combined?,14202,7402,naqanet,3f480dadaa1a1b796a7b4e86759c40e2,How many US$ was the difference between the highest GDP and the lowest?,19520,23018,naqanet,6aafcfcd1ea91187d4a74c8ea32a42a0,How many percentage points higher is the growth rate of Quintana Roo compared to the federal district?,8.8,0.09999999999999964,nabert,daa409eb88baf4ab4765c9b2885ddf42,How many percentage points higher is the growth rate of Quintana Roo compared to the federal district?,8.8,21.8,naqanet,65705040e4753eb883e7ee968a8b5d2b,"In 2000, which federal entities had between $20000 and $30000 per capita GDP?",Federal District Nuevo León,Campeche,naqanet,e40b083d2a6aad48d3ac899fbb912b8b,"In 2000, which federal entities had between $20000 and $30000 per capita GDP?",Federal District Nuevo León,federal district,nabert,5963846c898ce81b4c98a4e3f992c058,"In 2000, which state had the second lowest GDP per capita?",Oaxaca,federal district,nabert,6624acc542dc100f8b47f5615bf6b9ba,Which is the state with the second lowest GDP per capita?,Oaxaca,"Federal District (US $26,320), Campeche",naqanet,714290d5e320a82b793e66cbf054ce40,Which is the state with the second lowest GDP per capita?,Oaxaca,guerrero,nabert,b2f8fcc89c9102a6908e0b264160bd5c,Which is the state with the third highest GDP growth rate?,San Luis Potosí,Baja California,naqanet,1bce57328f64249c2c5706c71bbfe115,Which state has the second lowest GDP?,Oaxaca,Baja California,naqanet,3e09c63665f430cacb560064a0b6dc1f,Which state has the third hightest GDP growth rate?,San Luis Potosí,Baja California,naqanet,04815c2a486126b8ea621c768c1660ff,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Sitcoms offered a romanticized view of middle class American life with The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952–1966), Father Knows Best (1954–1960), and American Broadcasting Companys The Donna Reed Show (1958–1966) exemplifying the genre. Emmy Award-winning comedy I Love Lucy (1951–1960) starred husband and wife Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball and enjoyed such popularity that some businesses closed early on Monday nights in order to allow employees to hurry home for the show. In The Life of Riley (1953–1958), blue collar Chester A. Riley (William Bendix) became the prototype for a long line of bumbling television patriarchs that included Fred Flintstone and Archie Bunker. The shows first incarnation for the DuMont Television Network lasted a season (1949–1950) and won an Emmy during the first Emmy Awards in 1949. The Honeymooners (1955–1956) followed bus driver Ralph Kramden (Jackie Gleason) and his sewer-working sidekick Ed Norton (Art Carney) while archetypal suburban life was limned in Leave It to Beaver (1957–1963), purportedly the first sitcom to be told from a childs point of view and the first to strike a blow for television realism by displaying a toilet in an early episode. Genre series were popular with Dragnet (series) (1952) starring Jack Webb representing police procedural drama, British television syndication series The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series) (1955) starring Richard Greene representing historical drama, and Gunsmoke (1955) with James Arness and Amanda Blake representing the western. Mid-decade, Warner Bros. produced a group of five westerns with Maverick (TV series) starring James Garner and Cheyenne (1955 TV series) starring Clint Walker leading the group in popularity.",c9e78f0b6637d4f8d55fdcc1ea1a3334,How many more years did I Love Lucy run as a sitcom on TV than Leave It To Beaver Beaver?,3,-1951,naqanet,2feac417a49b5a583635520706d2bdc3,How many more years did I Love Lucy run as a sitcom on TV than Leave It To Beaver Beaver?,3,9.0,nabert,196ca7efd1ef20fef3232d91e45044da,Which sitcoms on TV ran in 1955,Ozzie and Harriet Father Knows Best I Love Lucy The Life of Riley The Honeymooners The Adventures of Robin Hood Gunsmoke Maverick,Gunsmoke,naqanet,d2fc6c3b7606cbb8ae592d12fcbf7af4,Which sitcoms on TV ran in 1955,Ozzie and Harriet Father Knows Best I Love Lucy The Life of Riley The Honeymooners The Adventures of Robin Hood Gunsmoke Maverick,cheyenne,nabert,d24624df8b128ede8486c8c2f281c603,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Skopje, as the Republic of Macedonia as a whole, is characterised by a large ethnic diversity. The city is located in a region where Ethnic Albanians and Macedonians meet, and it welcomed Romani, Turks, Jews and Serbs throughout its history. Skopje was mainly a Muslim city until the 19th century, when large numbers of Christians started to settle there. According to the 2002 census, Macedonians were the largest ethnic group in Skopje, with 338,358 inhabitants, or 66.75% of the population. Then came Albanians with 103,891 inhabitants (20.49%), Roma people with 23,475 (4.63%), Serbs (14,298 inhabitants), Turks (8,595), Bosniaks (7,585) and Vlachs (2,557). 8,167 people did not belong to any of these groups.",61d831efe09cecd5eed3c432256a939e,How many fewer Albanians were in Skopje than Macedonians?,234467,-234467.0,nabert,dd67f5aecc9a841e5d271b394292cf18,How many in percent from the census in Skopje weren't Albanian?,79.51,4.63,naqanet,5826d7e2be570f039085d3b5526f3a98,How many in percent from the census in Skopje weren't Macedonian?,33.25,4.63,naqanet,d446fd54445ff8b730307c5ba41363ab,How many in percent from the census in Skopje weren't Roma?,95.37,4.63,naqanet,79be016d1a926d10afa1c229e4fdd1f7,How many many more Albanians were there than Serbs in Skopje in 2002?,89683,338358,naqanet,75f71af461258d6f208424fe3f31a73c,How many many more Albanians were there than Serbs in Skopje in 2002?,89683,89593.0,nabert,7a12ef895c8625a482037dcebf2632da,How many more Macedonians were there compared to Albanians according to the 2002 census?,234467,-234467,naqanet,406f338e5b2b13f30b37a7e94567c002,How many more Serbs are there than Turks?,5703,-5703,naqanet,23c777da7ee7fbd169c510e81000c4b6,How many of the ethnic groups listed had less than 10000 inhabitants in Skopje in 2002?,3,-338358,naqanet,c0d5738170572d1cb5574a70577eb727,How many of the ethnic groups listed had less than 10000 inhabitants in Skopje in 2002?,3,6,nabert,aae02d3ab2b44584b1f572980c991c62,How many of the ethnic groups listed had more than 10000 inhabitants in Skopje in 2002?,4,-234467,naqanet,b6af9e756b4b44528abca393d54f447f,How many of the ethnic groups listed had more than 10000 inhabitants in Skopje in 2002?,4,2,nabert,1cff7a79d3707bac23d660cea28591e4,"How many people, in terms of percentage of the population, were not Macedonians in Skopje in 2002?",33.25,20.49,naqanet,b52287bb0d4e8dec7e784627a64c25c8,Were there fewer Bosniaks or Vlachs living in Skopje in 2002?,Vlachs,bosniaks,nabert,9e76dd3a51141131173385d05a8d1963,Which ethnic group was the second largest in Skopje in 2002?,Albanians,Vlachs,naqanet,e5b210901d7088bedd0147d7a37fd462,Which ethnic groups went to Macedonia?,Romani Turks Jews Serbs,Vlachs,naqanet,26b9893b6c9c88587a1160c9151b4e8b,Which ethnic groups went to Macedonia?,Romani Turks Jews Serbs,macedonians,nabert,8ba2c8bfd12e5a1cf6066c20e33c3807,"Which group has a larger percentage in Skojpe, Albanians or Macedonians?",Macedonians,Albanians,naqanet,799b300348c34a44b2daf2d0d73c274a,"Which group has a smaller percentage in Skojpe, the Serbs or the Roma?",Serbs,Roma,naqanet,888b66677444a5757447c906402cc849,Who was the second most populous group in Skopje?,Albanians,Vlachs,naqanet,95291fccab4ad0982c71b0870c80b757
"Some sources state that three million Circassians were evicted from Circassia in a period lasting until 1911. Other sources cite upwards of two million Circassian refugees fleeing Circassia by 1914 and entering nations and regions such as the Balkans, Turkey, what was the Ottoman Empire in what was known as the Muhajir, Iran, the Qajar dynasty also as Muhajir, Syria, Lebanon, what is now Jordan, Kosovo, Egypt , Israel  and as far afield as upstate New York and New Jersey. Some 90 percent of people with Circassian descent now live in other countries, primarily in Turkey, Jordan and other countries of the Middle East, with only 300,000-400,000 remaining in what is now Russia. The depopulated Circassian lands were resettled by numerous ethnic groups, including Russians, Ukrainians and Georgians.

"Stabler finished the game with 12 out of 19 pass completions for 180 yards and 1 touchdown. Davis, who was the top rusher in the game, gained 137 yards on just 16 rushing attempts, an average of 8.5 yards per carry. Of Davis 16 carries, 11 were runs to the left side, which is where the blocking of guard Gene Upshaw, tackle Art Shell and Casper dominated defensive end Jim Marshall (gridiron football) and linebacker Wally Hilgenberg.

In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Browns kicker Phil Dawson getting a 40-yard field goal, along with Anderson completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  The Dolphins answered with Lemon completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE David Martin, yet Cleveland managed to get a 20-yard field goal from Dawson as time ran out. In the third quarter, the 'Fins started to retaliate with Lemon getting a 5-yard and a 1-yard TD run.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Browns would pull away with Anderson and Edwards hooking up with each other on a 5-yard and a 16-yard TD pass.

"Succession is now regulated by laws passed by the National Diet. The current law excludes women from the succession. A change to this law had been considered until Princess Kiko gave birth to a son. Until the birth of Prince Hisahito, son of Prince Akishino, on September 6, 2006, there was a potential succession problem, since Prince Akishino was the only male child to be born into the imperial family since 1965. Following the birth of Princess Aiko, there was public debate about amending the current Imperial Household Law to allow women to succeed to the throne. In January 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed a special panel composed of judges, university professors, and civil servants to study changes to the Imperial Household Law and to make recommendations to the government. The panel dealing with the succession issue recommended on October 25, 2005, amending the law to allow females of the male line of imperial descent to ascend the Japanese throne. On January 20, 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi devoted part of his annual keynote speech to the controversy, pledging to submit a bill allowing women to ascend the throne to ensure that the succession continues in the future in a stable manner. Shortly after the announcement that Princess Kiko was pregnant with her third child, Koizumi suspended such plans. Her son, Prince Hisahito, is the third in line to the throne under the current law of succession. On January 3, 2007, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced that he would drop the proposal to alter the Imperial Household Law.",499dc9955a663b22a8290d529082402b,How many different types of people did Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appoint to the special panel?,3,2,naqanet,e29d8302758353d29f471b1284622d53,How many different types of people did Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appoint to the special panel?,3,4,nabert,739a2cf616d4bd41316c5e2ac537e412,How many months after a panel was formed did they make a decision to support a revision to the law?,9,2,naqanet,41ffe2015508ba25371eab082ffd8409,How many months after a panel was formed did they make a decision to support a revision to the law?,9,4,nabert,3743d40980ddbcc9bebb2c01698a6a3a,How many months after the birth of Hisahito were plans to change the succession law dropped?,4,10,nabert,487859d20030cf349e5d4b3c5dbee2da,How many months after the birth of Hisahito were plans to change the succession law dropped?,4,2,naqanet,d88b2536fdc58cfac955d10e29f673fe,How many years after the Prime Minister promised to submit a bill allowing women to ascend the throne did he drop the proposal?,1,2006,naqanet,1a4f548819b7656dea16f7879ec2d68e,How many years after the panel was formed was the proposal dismissed?,2,0,naqanet,0a0f8f468dfd22710a89a9127357fa47,Princess Kiko is the mother of who?,Prince Hisahito,Hisahito,naqanet,b800ae1b6318f44c90f4a02f53059107,Princess Kiko is the mother of who?,Prince Hisahito,prince akishino,nabert,3997dc829526bf6cb5562b30b4ad1a69,Who is second in line to the throne?,Prince Akishino,Prince Hisahito,naqanet,8a8e562eb3f367ec2c5c0717c431b9ee,Who is the father of Prince Hisahito?,Prince Akishino,Princess Kiko,naqanet,cc497dc8191fdddc6c8cf993c48d4cc0,Who is the mother of Prince Hisahito?,Princess Kiko,Koizumi,naqanet,6a8cc8ab7468e1c1a34c5f0de06d3345,Who was Hisahito's mother?,Princess Kiko,Prince,naqanet,384dc357c68dbb4c161a60d725ab9e45,Who was Hisahito's sister?,Princess Aiko,Prince,naqanet,73cee28d70b65059d3a0c576f1f35614,Who was Hisahito's sister?,Princess Aiko,princess kiko,nabert,f94871f872cc0031a43a0e2eeff1f3e9,"Who was born first, Prince Hisahito or Prince Akishino?",Prince Akishino,Prince Hisahito,naqanet,6e6d06ed1534f7abd0a8e5d9f776355c,"Who was the Prime Minister of Japan first, Shinzō Abe or Junichiro Koizumi?",Junichiro Koizumi,Shinzō Abe,naqanet,037098b7cf02fc2f62c54f84330c1ad5,"Who was the Prime Minister of Japan first, Shinzō Abe or Junichiro Koizumi?",Junichiro Koizumi,shinzo abe,nabert,df0a5498729a4218c7712dd0d3562c5d,none,none,none,none,none

"The 4th Division was reactivated on 1 June 1940 at Fort Benning, Georgia, under the command of Major general (United States) Walter E. Prosser. Commencing in August the formation was reorganized as a motorized division and assigned (along with the 2nd Armored Division (United States)) to I Armored Corps (United States), being officially given its motorized title in parenthesized style and then formally as the 4th Motorized Division effective 11 July 1941. The division participated in Louisiana maneuvers held during August 1941 and then in the Carolina Maneuvers of October 1941, after which it returned to Fort Benning. The division transferred to Camp Gordon, Georgia, in December 1941, the month America entered World War II, and rehearsed training at the Carolina Maneuver Area during the summer of 1942. The division, now under the command of Major General Raymond O. Barton, then moved on 12 April 1943 to Fort Dix, New Jersey, where it was again reconfigured and redesignated the 4th Infantry Division on 4 August of that year. The division participated in battlefield maneuvers in Florida starting in September and after this fall training exercise arrived at Fort Jackson (South Carolina), South Carolina, on 1 December 1943. At this station the division was alerted for overseas movement and staged at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, beginning 4 January 1944 prior to departing the New York Port of Embarkation on 18 January 1944.

"The 5 October 1910 revolution was the overthrow of the centuries-old Portuguese Monarchy and its replacement by the Portuguese Republic. It was the result of a coup d'état organized by the Portuguese Republican Party. By 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal was in deep crisis: British pressure on Portugal's colonies, the royal family's expenses, the assassination of the King and his heir in 1908, changing religious and social views, instability of the two political parties , the dictatorship of João Franco, and the regime's apparent inability to adapt to modern times all led to widespread resentment against the Monarchy. The proponents of the republic, particularly the Republican Party, found ways to take advantage of the situation. The Republican Party presented itself as the only one that had a programme that was capable of returning to the country its lost status and place Portugal on the way of progress. After a reluctance of the military to combat the nearly two thousand soldiers and sailors that rebelled between 3 and 4 October 1910, the Republic was proclaimed at 9 o'clock of the next day from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho in Lisbon. After the revolution, a provisional government led by Teófilo Braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the Constitution in 1911 that marked the beginning of the First Republic. Among other things, with the establishment of the republic, national symbols were changed: the national anthem and the flag. The revolution produced some civil and religious liberties, although there was no advance in women's rights and in workers rights, unlike what happened in other European countries.",76e1368d94be5c77073594a84caaabf3,How many years after the assassination of the Portuguese king was the revolution?,2,-2,naqanet,81db12169a7622218d079c2b1ab7970e,"How many years elapsed between the assassination of the King of Portugal, and the revolution to overthrow the monarchy?",2,-2,naqanet,e89d59f8f1357a65dab5fbc7c2c08f26,On what day was the Republic proclained?,October 5 1910,1910,naqanet,9b0ee0f73b80eb8ce37e70e3580c0954,On what day was the Republic proclained?,October 5 1910,9,nabert,57680df31cc4130437d21befd1a45398,What did Teófilo Braga lead until the approval of the Constitution in 1911?,a provisional government,First Republic,naqanet,c42a207ca533cac2f6f0e252de71714d,What did Teófilo Braga lead until the approval of the Constitution in 1911?,a provisional government,"provisional government led by teofilo braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the constitution in 1911 that marked the beginning of the first republic . among other things , with the establishment of the republic",nabert,39409c229ea816c7c3162b8cd5295a02,When was the Republic proclaimed?,October 5 1910,1910,naqanet,a1e5f3340de997c8426cabc4452706f8,When was the Republic proclaimed?,October 5 1910,1911,nabert,e2cd49c6e7f12138ba6b91479db39311,"Which came first, the Portuguese Monarchy or the Portuguese Republic?",Portuguese Monarchy,monarchy,nabert,5102b43e4a096186d4918fa4727cf072,Which political party assumed control after the 5 October 1910 revolution?,the Portuguese Republican Party,the Portuguese Republic,naqanet,3c540a758debd3c2bd60a5f084919611,Who started  the revoultion?,Portuguese Republican Party,The Republican Party,naqanet,a39e28e03efe04497d55d9323a44f764,Who started  the revoultion?,Portuguese Republican Party,party,nabert,37f437ef73840b28b3c135f27c426274,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Allies dropped 44,923.2 tons of bombs on the city during World War II, destroying 61% of its built up area. During the Bombing of Cologne in World War II, Cologne endured 262 air raids by the Western Allies of World War II, which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of ""Operation Millennium"", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the Royal Air Force in World War II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary. This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed  of built-up area (61%),  killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless. The devastation was recorded by Hermann Claasen from 1942 until the end of the war, and presented in his exhibition and book of 1947 Singing in the furnace.

"The Astros won the 2005 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, 3-1, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players used by a single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6-1, Lance Berkman hit an eighth-inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6-5. In the bottom of the ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus hit a game-tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the fifteenth inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out Julio Franco, at the time the oldest player in the MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if it came to that. Clemens struck out, but the next batter, Chris Burke (baseball), hit a home run to left field for the Astros win, 7-6. Oddly enough, a fan in the ""Crawford Boxes"" in left field had previously caught Berkmans grand slam and this same fan caught Burkes home run.  The 2005 National League Championship Series featured a rematch of the 2004 National League Championship Series. The Astros lost the first game in St. Louis, but would win the next three games, with Roy Oswalt getting the win. Though the Astros were poised to close out the series in Game Five in Houston, Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two-out three-run home run to Albert Pujols, forcing the series to a sixth game in St. Louis, where the Astros clinched a World Series appearance. Roy Oswalt was named NLCS MVP, having gone 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA in the series. Current honorary NL President William Y. Giles presented the league champion Astros with the Warren C. Giles Trophy.

"The Astros won the 2005 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, 3-1, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players used by a single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6-1, Lance Berkman hit an eighth-inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6-5. In the bottom of the ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus hit a game-tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the fifteenth inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out Julio Franco, at the time the oldest player in the MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if it came to that. Clemens struck out, but the next batter, Chris Burke (baseball), hit a home run to left field for the Astros win, 7-6. Oddly enough, a fan in the ""Crawford Boxes"" in left field had previously caught Berkmans grand slam and this same fan caught Burkes home run.

"The Bears and Panthers squared off and it was defensive. The lone score of the first quarter came when Brandon Lloyd recovered a blocked punt and took it nine yards to score. Each team was able to score a field goal as Robbie Gould and John Kasay hit field goals from 26 and 37 yards, respectively. Jason McKie scored a touchdown for the Bears to open the second half, and John Kasay nailed a 45-yard field goal. Jonathan Stewart was able to get into the endzone for his first career touchdown.

"The Bears kicked off their season at home with an NFC North duel against the Detroit Lions. In the first quarter, the Bears took the early lead with kicker Robbie Gould nailing a 20-yard field goal. The Lions responded with 2 TD runs (7 and 4 yards) by running back Jahvid Best in the second quarter. The Bears fought back with quarterback Jay Cutler completing an 89-yard screen pass to running back Matt Fort&#233; for a TD, followed by Gould's 31-yard field goal after a Stafford fumble. The Bears increased their lead in the fourth quarter when Cutler threw a 28-yard TD pass to Matt Fort&#233;. The Bears tried to extend their lead to 7, but failed on their 2-point conversion.

"The Bechers had their first gallery exhibition in 1963 at the Galerie Ruth Nohl in Siegen. Their work became better known in the United States with the publication of their book Anonyme Skulpturen (Anonymous Sculptures) in 1970. The Bechers were shown at the George Eastman House and in solo exhibitions at Sonnabend Gallery, New York, in 1972. In 1974, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, organized an exhibition of their work, which toured the United Kingdom. The couple was invited to participate in Documenta 5, 6, 7, and 11 in Kassel in 1972, 1977, 1982 and 2002, and at the Bienal de São Paulo in 1977. The Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, organized a retrospective of the artists’ work in 1981. In 1985 the artists had a major museum exhibition, which traveled to the Museum Folkwang, Essen, Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Liège, Belgium. In 1991 the artists won the Leone d’Oro award for sculpture at the Venice Biennale. The Venice installation was reworked later in 1991, in a retrospective exhibition at the Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne. The Typologies installation was exhibited in 1994 at the Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation, Toronto, and at the Westphalian State Museum of Art and Cultural History in Münster. Other retrospectives of the couple’s work have been organized by the Photographische Sammlung/SK Stiftung Kulture in Cologne (1999 and 2003), Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (2005) and Museum of Modern Art in New York (2008).",e2afdc515e560027b2d39e5804d61fe8,How many years was the couple invited to participate in Documenta?,4,30,naqanet,c22bea3b7618037ea780a0cb5d7c1b60,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"The Bethencourt era ended in 1418 when Maciot sold his holdings and the rights to subjugate the remaining islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán. From this point on the intervention of the King of Castile increased. Between 1418 and 1445 dominion over the islands changed hands on a number of occasions. Finally, control over the conquered islands and the right to further conquests fell to Hernán Peraza The Elder and his children Guillén Peraza and Inés Peraza. The death of Guillén Peraza in the attack on La Palma has been immortalized in a moving lament. After the death of her brother Inés and her husband Diego García de Herrera became the sole rulers of the islands until 1477 when they ceded La Gomera to their son Hernán Peraza The Younger and the rights to the conquest of La Palma, Gran Canaria and Tenerife to the King of Castile. The island of La Gomera was not taken in battle but was incorporated into the Peraza-Herrera fiefdom through an agreement between Hernán Peraza The Elder and some of the insular aboriginal groups who accepted the rule of the Castilian. However, there were a number of uprisings by the guanches due to outrages committed by the rulers on the native Gomeros. The last one, in 1488 caused the death of the islands ruler, Hernán Peraza, whose widow, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, had to seek the assistance of Pedro de Vera, conqueror of Gran Canaria, in order to snuff out the rebellion. The subsequent repression caused the death of two hundred rebels and many others were sold into slavery in the Spanish markets.",9de03ded187ffbaaac206aa521600dbb,In what year did Hernán Peraza and his children receive control over the conquered islands?,1445,1446.0,nabert,bf0bc77aee17d400f58f8edac0bdaf01,What year did the rebellion end?,1488,0,naqanet,fb5912190196c92feffba52385d89631,What year did the rebellion end?,1488,1445,nabert,74e94206a936c72a16ea9e333d90738b,Who had control over the islands after 1445?,Hernán Peraza The Elder Guillén Peraza and Inés Peraza,Maciot sold his holdings and the rights to subjugate the remaining islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán,naqanet,5cac9de5968c0149b644106a203912ee,Who had control over the islands after 1445?,Hernán Peraza The Elder Guillén Peraza and Inés Peraza,king of castile,nabert,c804c5fb661141bcfba61963cbe40de9,Who needed help ending the rebellion?,Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio,"Hernán Peraza, whose widow, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, had to seek the assistance of Pedro de Vera",naqanet,f0b6d73d7f55e50d3f4af95c2a0bff6b,Who needed help ending the rebellion?,Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio,pedro de vera,nabert,003428109323504b0d8eb4cd1eeb98b4,Who was Hernán Peraza The Younger's father?,Diego García de Herrera,Herrera fiefdom,naqanet,18ca89db2c70e09526c5c6edd0fcb21b,Who was Hernán Peraza The Younger's father?,Diego García de Herrera,ines,nabert,f1a930c5a524f153d91b0070f869084f,Who was given the islands after 1477?,until 1477 when they ceded to their son Hernán Peraza,Hernán Peraza The Elder,naqanet,7a4d801ce989c644a06ad4cf20223d95,Who was given the islands after 1477?,until 1477 when they ceded to their son Hernán Peraza,diego garcia de herrera,nabert,f9080169eb3f9663632310a04fc6a42f,Who was the father of Guillen Peraza?,Hernán Peraza The Elder,Hernán,naqanet,0e461c872b237ea4fd18d20f01fc2ae8,Who was the father of Guillen Peraza?,Hernán Peraza The Elder,hernan peraza the elder,nabert,b4963d49bf10998b4292c6bfccd5fa81,Who was the father of Inés Peraza?,Hernán Peraza The Elder,Hernán,naqanet,282def6d42d35d9c58355c7d88534358,Who was the father of Inés Peraza?,Hernán Peraza The Elder,hernan peraza the elder,nabert,642675a47c9b9b0bac9cea266fb782fb,Who was the husband of Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio?,Hernán Peraza,pedro de vera,nabert,c2ec84eb61c669c4f5de5ad0f5476f8b,Who was the son of Inés Peraza?,Hernán Peraza The Younger,Hernán,naqanet,5058465e8d0b14e00f6189299c6e4e1b,Who was the son of Inés Peraza?,Hernán Peraza The Younger,guillen peraza,nabert,baa42df994c9d22f86cdb06c03f9dece,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"The Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles Simon Peter and Paul of Tarsus there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the Catholic Church. After the Decline of the Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to Byzantine Empire control after the Gothic War (535-554), which devastated the city. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273 to 35,000 after the Gothic War (535-554), reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens. It is generally thought the population of the city until 300 A.D. was 1 million (estimates range from 2 million to 750,000)  declining to 750-800,000 in 400 A.D., 450-500,000 in 450 A.D. and down to 80-100,000 in 500 A.D.

"The Bolsheviks' and Vladimir Lenin's October Revolution of 7 November 1917 transferred political power in Petrograd to the radical, left-wing socialists. The German government's decision to arrange safe conduct for Lenin and his comrades from exile in Switzerland to Petrograd in April 1917, was a success. An armistice between Germany and the Bolshevik regime came into force on 6 December and peace negotiations began on 22 December 1917 at Brest-Litovsk. November 1917 became another watershed in the 1917-1918 rivalry for the leadership of Finland. After the dissolution of the Finnish Parliament, polarisation between the social democrats and the conservatives increased markedly and the period witnessed the appearance of political violence. An agricultural worker had been shot during a local strike on 9 August 1917 at Ypäjä and a Civil Guard member was killed in a local political crisis at Malmi on 24 September. The October Revolution disrupted the informal truce between the Finnish non-socialists and the Russian Provisional Government. After political wrangling over how to react to the revolt, the majority of the politicians accepted a compromise proposal by Santeri Alkio, the leader of the Agrarian League. Parliament seized the sovereign power in Finland on 15 November 1917 based on the socialists' ""Law of Supreme Power"" and ratified their proposals of an eight-hour working day and universal suffrage in local elections, from July 1917.",0df82797de953b3b64221127a925250e,How many days after an agricultural worker had been shot during a local strike was a Civil Guard member was killed in a local political crisis at Malmi?,46,15,naqanet,bcddd581aff7f61179a65db51f04d49d,How many months after the October Revolution did the armistice come into force?,1,2,naqanet,4626e0d4bfd95de8336771c07c587e8f,How many months after the October Revolution did the armistice come into force?,1,4,nabert,52a3c3ae839968c23da555049f774538,How many months passed between the two deaths during the political violence of 1917?,1,2,naqanet,ab83cddb91c97ff2195cbb707ebfd6fa,How many months passed between the two deaths during the political violence of 1917?,1,7,nabert,9a3487d5c49e2a0fc3e0ca15f9c700d3,How many years did the rivalry for leadership of Finland last?,2,1,naqanet,f9151728c0efea68f327d2f646443311,"Which happened first, safe conduct for Lenin to Petrograd, or the October Revolution?",safe conduct for Lenin,safe conduct for Lenin to Petrograd,naqanet,eff88715b2c0b48165ce72585c235adc,"Which happened first, safe conduct for Lenin to Petrograd, or the October Revolution?",safe conduct for Lenin,vladimir lenin ' s october revolution,nabert,d4d3ba16176a165fb5ed43aecb9325cf,"Which happened first, the agricultural worker shooting or the Civil Guard member being killed?",the agricultural worker shooting,Civil Guard member was killed,naqanet,d5210a7c88d003d9e39ce48a26384a3d,"Which happened first, the agricultural worker shooting or the Civil Guard member being killed?",the agricultural worker shooting,agricultural worker had been shot,nabert,b9e4ad46c1650fb605eab52b7aede498,"Which happened first, the shooting of a worker during a strike, or the killing of a Civil Guard member in Malmi?",worker had been shot,Civil Guard member was killed,naqanet,e4cc79e60f21d35792ba4ad1cefc3197,"Which happened first, the shooting of a worker during a strike, or the killing of a Civil Guard member in Malmi?",worker had been shot,shot during a local strike,nabert,e477b735a6df379ea7b18bbbe9a20200,"Who was killed by political violence first, the agricultural worker or the Civil Guard member?",the agricultural worker,Civil Guard member,naqanet,c352afdf5b04388ca49b720f8ad71bc2,"Who was killed first, a Civil Guard member or an agricultural worker?",agricultural worker,Civil Guard member,naqanet,b210ac3bcf8d8d3b39a444c7c46de360,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"The Broncos began their 2008 campaign on the road against their AFC West rival, the Oakland Raiders, in the second game of ESPN's Monday Night Football doubleheader.  In the first quarter, Denver ran out of the gates early as QB Jay Cutler completed a 26-yard TD pass to rookie WR Eddie Royal (who was filling in for WR Brandon Marshall, due to his 1-game suspension).  In the second quarter, the Broncos continued their domination as kicker Matt Prater got a 26-yard field goal, while FB Michael Pittman got a 3-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, Denver ran away with the game as Cutler completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson, while Prater nailed a 43-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Raiders spoiled the Broncos' bid for a shutout as QB JaMarcus Russell completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Ashley Lelie.  Denver ended its domination with RB Selvin Young's 5-yard TD run and Pittman's 1-yard TD run.  Oakland ended the scoring with Russell completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry. With the dominating win, the Broncos began their season at 1-0; with the rest of the division suffering losses, Denver, in Week 1, is in sole possession of 1st place.

"The Broncos' defense surrendered only three field goals by Texans' placekicker Nick Novak, and spoiled quarterback Brock Osweiler's return to Denver, allowing only 131 passing yards. Osweiler spent the previous four seasons (2012-2015) as Peyton Manning's backup quarterback, and started seven games in 2015 while Manning was injured. The Broncos scored three offensive touchdowns: a 4-yard pass from quarterback Trevor Siemian to Demaryius Thomas, plus two rushing touchdowns, one from C. J. Anderson, and the other from rookie Devontae Booker. Placekicker Brandon McManus also added two field goals. This was the first of two games in which the Broncos wore wear their alternate navy blue uniforms&#8212;the other was Week 15 vs. the New England Patriots. This was Broncos' head coach Gary Kubiak's first victory against the Texans, for whom he coached from 2006-2013, as well as Kubiak's return to the sideline following a health scare that forced him to miss the team's Week 6 loss to the San Diego Chargers. During halftime, three former Broncos were inducted into the Ring of Fame: Placekicker Jason Elam, who played with the Broncos from 1993-2007 and is the franchise's all-time leader in field goals (395) and points scored (1,786); defensive lineman Simon Fletcher, who played with the Broncos from 1985-1995 and is the franchise's all-time leader in sacks (97.5) and consecutive games played (172); safety John Lynch, who played four seasons with the Broncos from 2004-2007.",f3819b710e7fb32cddbbdaab7b88f7ed,How many passing touchdowns did the Broncos throw?,1,2,naqanet,712f4166d3a060160a60324b13b22471,How many points in total were scored by the Texans?,9,1792.0,nabert,997d3733a8c685dba546493032bbdfa9,How many points in total were scored by the Texans?,9,2181,naqanet,ca713ef394838c85233a1a91b48248b9,How many points in touchdowns did Denver score?,21,2,naqanet,17d85a94a8ea3ceb34d070da2d77f675,How many points in touchdowns did Denver score?,21,9.0,nabert,59541c947d01091a6de7b869a54384e4,How many years did John Lynch play for the Broncos?,4,3,naqanet,9d7cbc662fe8e622775636772610e4b1,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Browns hosted the rival Pittsburgh Steelers on a night with subzero wind chills for a Week 14 duel. In windy conditions, Phil Dawson hit a pair of 29-yard field goals, and Chris Jennings had a 10-yard touchdown run to put the Browns up 13. Jeff Reed nailed a field goal before the half to draw the Steelers within 10, and hit another in the third to bring them within a touchdown. However, a scoreless fourth by both teams led the Browns to their first win against the Steelers since 2003, and the Browns became only the fourth team in NFL history to be at least 10 games under .500 and defeat the defending Super Bowl champions. With the win, the Browns improved to 2-11, snapped a twelve-game losing streak against the Steelers and won against them for the first time since 2003 when they defeated the team 33-13 in Pittsburgh.  The team also won their first home game since an October 2008 victory, interestingly against then-defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants.

"The Buccaneers hosted the Titans at Raymond James Stadium, their second inter-conference matchup in two weeks. Buccaneers running back Earnest Graham was a part of the starting lineup for the first time in his career, replacing the injured Michael Pittman, who sat out the game. The first half was a defensive struggle, with neither team scoring in the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Tennessee drove to the Buccaneers 32-yard line, but quarterback Vince Young fumbled the ball and the Buccaneers recovered. Jeff Garcia connected on a 39-yard pass play to Michael Clayton, to help set up a 23-yard Matt Bryant field goal, the first points of the game. Moments later, Phillip Buchanon intercepted Vince Young with 1:29 remaining in the half, to maintain a 3-0 halftime lead. Tennessee took the second half kickoff, and executed a 12-play, 45-yard drive which resulted in a 48-yard field goal by Rob Bironas. On their next possession, Vince Young ran out of bounds, and suffered a strained quad. He would have to leave the game, and was replaced by Kerry Collins. On Tampa Bay's next drive, Garcia connected with Joey Galloway for a 69-yard touchdown catch. On the ensuing drive Ronde Barber intercepted a pass by Kerry Collins, but it ruled incomplete after review. With less than four minutes remaining in regulation, Collins drove the Titans to the Buccaneers 23-yard line. For the second time, Ronde Barber intercepted Collins, this time in the endzone, but it was again ruled incomplete after review. The drive continued, and with 1:24 remaining, LenDale White tied the game 10-10 with a touchdown run. With only one timeout, Garcia drove the Buccaneers 55 yards on seven plays.

"The Byzantine civil war of 1373-1379 was a military conflict fought in the Byzantine Empire between Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos and his son, Andronikos IV Palaiologos, also growing into an Ottoman civil war as well, when Savcı Bey, the son of Ottoman Emperor Murad I joined Andronikos in a joint rebellion against their fathers. It began when Andronikos sought to overthrow his father in 1373. Although he failed, with Genoese aid, Andronikos was eventually able to overthrow and imprison John V in 1376. In 1379 however, John V escaped, and with Ottoman help, regained his throne.

"The Chargers (1-0) won their season opener 22-14 against the Oakland Raiders after five field goals by Nate Kaeding and three botched punts by the Raiders. The Raiders Pro Bowl long snapper Jon Condo suffered a head injury in the second quarter. He was replaced by linebacker Travis Goethel, who had not snapped since high school. Goethel rolled two snaps to punter Shane Lechler, each giving the Chargers the ball in Raiders territory, and Lechler had another punt blocked by Dante Rosario. The Chargers scored their only touchdown in the second quarter after a 13-play, 90-yard drive resulted in a 6-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers to wide receiver Malcom Floyd. The Chargers failed to score four out of five times in the red zone. San Diego led at halftime 10-6, and the Raiders did not scored a touchdown until 54 seconds remained in the game. Undrafted rookie Mike Harris made his first NFL start, filing in for left tackle for an injured Jared Gaither. San Diego protected Harris by having Rivers throw short passes; sixteen of Rivers' 24 completions were to running backs and tight ends, and he threw for 231 yards while only being sacked once. He did not have an interception after throwing 20 in 2011. The win was the Chargers' eighth in their previous nine games at Oakland. It improved Norv Turner's record to 4-2 in Chargers' season openers.

"The Czech lands were among the first industrialized countries in continental Europe during the German Confederation era. The Czech industrial tradition dates back to the 19th century, when the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were the economic and industrial heartland of the Austrian Empire and later the Austrian side of Austria-Hungary. The Czech lands produced a majority  of all industrial goods in the Empire, some of which were almost monopolistic. The Czechoslovak crown was introduced in April 1919. Introduced at a 1:1 ratio to the Austro-Hungarian currency, it became one of the most stable currencies in Europe. The First Republic became one of the 10 most developed countries of the world . The consequences of the 1938 Munich Agreement and subsequent occupation were disastrous for the economy. After the occupation and forced subordination of the economy to German economic interests, the crown was officially pegged to the mark at a ratio of 1:10, even though the unofficial exchange rate was 1 to 6-7 and Germans immediately started buying Czech goods in large quantities. In accordance with Stalin's development policy of planned interdependence, all the economies of the socialist countries were tightly linked to that of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was the most prosperous country in the Eastern Bloc, however it continued to lag further behind the rest of the developed world.

"The Dutch East India Company  fleet from Batavia sailed at the end of 1620. The fleet consisted of 19 ships, 1,655 European troops and 286 Asian auxiliaries, and was led by Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen. On 21 February 1621, The fleet arrived in Fort Nassau, where it was reinforced by the fort's 250-strong garrison and 36 indigenous vessels. After unsuccessfully trying to recruit Englishmen from the nearby Run and Ay islands, Coen began sending scouts to the coastline of Lontor, the main Bandanese island. The reconnaissance took two days, during which some boats came under cannon fire from the native defenders. The scouts found fortified positions along the Southern coast and in the hills and failed to find a possible beachhead. On 7 March, a VOC probing party landed in the island but was repulsed after suffering one dead and four wounded. On 11 March he ordered a decisive assault. He divided his forces into several groups, which attacked different points in the island. The invaders swiftly captured key strongholds, and by the end of the day the island's northern lowlands and southern promontories. The defenders and local population fled to the hills that made up the island's center, with the Dutch forces in pursuit. By the end of 12 March, the Dutch occupied the whole island, suffering six dead and 27 wounded.",9f5feb9a775606d5b018199dbe253e01,How many days after landing in Fort Nassau did the VOC probing party land on the island?,14,4.0,nabert,bdac90c6092cb28b471565adefde90d4,How many more men were wounded than dead?,21,26.0,nabert,241ac503198d20a15415d1b575d62d2a,How many people were wounded or died in this passage?,38,27,naqanet,968ba16348a3bdd65bcda2d4eea600d3,How many people were wounded or died in this passage?,38,28.0,nabert,ac92f1ae8ac5e3947d9a5df877401b8c,"What happened first, the Dutch East India Company Fleet sailed from Batavia, or when Coen began to send scouts to the coastline of Lontor?",Dutch East India Company fleet sailed from Batavia,Dutch East India Company  fleet from Batavia sailed,naqanet,dbfe118b6e7c3b16b8556d8bdd04a987,"What happened first, the Dutch East India Company Fleet sailed from Batavia, or when Coen began to send scouts to the coastline of Lontor?",Dutch East India Company fleet sailed from Batavia,batavia,nabert,53ac8477c8185e3ee36e54796f72c227,Where there more killed or wounded by the end of the assault on March 12?,wounded,killed,naqanet,c8fba1562ee801de144b09a73aa4563c,"Who made up more of the Dutch East India Company fleet troops, Europeans or Asian auxiliaries?",European troops,asian auxiliaries,nabert,3e572aed8e095d9fd32652c9bba52d64,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Dutch Reformed Church remained the largest church body in the Netherlands until the middle of the 20th century, when it was overtaken by the Roman Catholic Church. The rapid secularisation of the Netherlands in the 1960s dramatically reduced participation in the mainstream Protestant church. From the '60s onward, a number of attempts were made to effect a reunion with the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands . This led to the two churches uniting with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands  to establish the Protestant Church in the Netherlands in 2004. The 2004 merger led to a separation in which a number of congregations and members of the Dutch Reformed Church separated to form the Restored Reformed Church . Estimations of their membership vary from 35,000 up to 70,000 in about 120 local congregations served by 88 ministers. The Restored Reformed Church disapproves of the pluralistic nature of the merged church, which they allege contains partly contradicting Reformed and Lutheran confessions. This conservative group also opposes the ordination of women and the blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches, which have been adopted as practices by the merged church.",8cd56a6045dae2267341c3f1f6fdd561,"After the mid 20th century, which church had more members, the Dutch Reformed Church, or the Roman Catholic Church?",Roman Catholic Church,"Dutch Reformed Church, or the Roman Catholic Church",naqanet,05acf39f6e5d7b045ffd2d335746497d,Did the Restored Reformed Church have fewer local congregations or ministers?,ministers,local congregations,nabert,27f7d2aecf5f9bc7ef0fd46a8b6f038c,How many are more congregations are there than ministers?,32,69912.0,nabert,82f23e163992048b8914d3c087cecd6c,How many churches merged together in 2004?,3,2,naqanet,8908dea991265c0846890c57dff85f81,How many churches united to establish the Protestant Church in the Netherlands in 2004?,3,2,naqanet,6898ed0b8dca7347dfded72fed7070fb,THE PROTESTANT CHURCH ADOPTED TWO PRACTICES THAT THE DUTCH REFORMED CHURCH OPPOSES,ordination of women blessing of same-sex unions,The Dutch Reformed Church,naqanet,cb7e0aacb202db7b76aab4d407af3d7b,THE PROTESTANT CHURCH ADOPTED TWO PRACTICES THAT THE DUTCH REFORMED CHURCH OPPOSES,ordination of women blessing of same-sex unions,ordination of women and the blessing of same - sex unions,nabert,6b40a96238f04b5b8fe20adaca9bb8de,WHAT HELPED THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH TO BECOME THE LARGEST CHURCH BODY IN THE NETHERLANDS ?,rapid secularisation,The Dutch Reformed Church,naqanet,20dd67206a0ff20288b995511c97f6ce,WHAT HELPED THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH TO BECOME THE LARGEST CHURCH BODY IN THE NETHERLANDS ?,rapid secularisation,"until the middle of the 20th century , when it was overtaken by the roman catholic church . the rapid secularisation of the netherlands in the 1960s dramatically reduced participation in the mainstream protestant church . from the ' 60s onward , a number of attempts were made to effect a reunion with the reformed churches in the netherlands . this led to the two churches uniting with the evangelical lutheran church in the kingdom of the netherlands to establish the protestant church",nabert,64461ca6878f05e05c6e7c966f36f51e,Which church had the most members in the middle of the 20th century?,Dutch Reformed Church,Roman Catholic Church,naqanet,523d78ada110d76ac29184e7bbce910a,Which church had the most members in the middle of the 20th century?,Dutch Reformed Church,netherlands,nabert,e6268642f4c0797566e2ab68a665c527,Which churches merged together in 2004?,Evangelical Lutheran Church The Dutch Reformed Church the Roman Catholic Church,local congregations,naqanet,ff26e45c5c731d28a17f832d5bef9c28,Which churches merged together in 2004?,Evangelical Lutheran Church The Dutch Reformed Church the Roman Catholic Church,restored reformed church,nabert,e88c99a918a162e2739d68264836dfaf,"Which event happened first, the Roman Catholic Church took over or the Dutch Reformed Church separated?",Dutch Reformed Church separated,Dutch Reformed Church,naqanet,4f13b09829f2be885b84ac1c8f944c65,"Which event happened first, the Roman Catholic Church took over or the Dutch Reformed Church separated?",Dutch Reformed Church separated,roman catholic church took over or the dutch reformed church separated,nabert,d20786da9b75c3e5a5fb5873559b1cc1,"Which event was a result of the other, the formation of the Restored Reformed Church or the 2004 merger of Lutheran and Reformed Churches?",the formation of the Restored Reformed Church,Restored Reformed Church,naqanet,de92a4a979326faaccdf35a313674b89,Which two churches united with the Evangelical Lutheran Church?,The Dutch Reformed Church Roman Catholic Church,Kingdom of the Netherlands,naqanet,d694326bdb8867b41df7eb50957fe18c,Which two churches united with the Evangelical Lutheran Church?,The Dutch Reformed Church Roman Catholic Church,protestant church,nabert,b2cf60aa18533ad4224264ce16e22005,Which two subjects does the conservative group oppose?,ordination of women blessing of same-sex unions,ordination of women,naqanet,b976991d8dc10073fdcd4f1259dce0d3,restored reformed church ministers serve its members in how many congregations,120,32,naqanet,6ecb69c86513ef3f92913f9b55dc46f5
"The Eagles began their season at Bank of America Stadium for a Week 1 duel with the Carolina Panthers.  Philadelphia trailed early in the first quarter as Panthers running back DeAngelo Williams ran 11 yards for a Carolina touchdown on their first drive.  The Eagles answered with a 49-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. In the second quarter, Philadelphia exploded with points as defensive end Victor Abiamiri returned a fumble 2 yards for a touchdown, wide receiver DeSean Jackson returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown, and quarterback Donovan McNabb completed a 9-yard TD pass to tight end Brent Celek and a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook. Carolina ended the period with kicker John Kasay booting a 22-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Eagles closed out their scoring with McNabb scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run.  However, he was hit late by several Carolina tacklers who cracked his ribs on the right side, knocking him out of the game.

"The Eagles faced off with the Baltimore Ravens in an interconference matchup.  Both defenses dominated the first quarter, and in the second quarter, Baltimore forced three turnovers (two interceptions and a fumble) from Donovan McNabb.  Ravens kicker Matt Stover booted a 44-yard field goal, while quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Wilcox.  However, rookie  Quintin Demps returned the following kickoff 100 yards for a Philadelphia touchdown to make it 10-7 Ravens at halftime.  Andy Reid decided to bench McNabb (who was 8-for-18 for 59 yards and two interceptions) and put backup quarterback Kevin Kolb into the game.  Kolb also struggled with the Baltimore defense, and the Eagles fell behind 12-7 when linebacker Jameel McClain blocked Sav Rocca's punt into the back of the endzone for a safety. In the fourth, the Ravens kicked another field goal after a Kolb interception, then Mark Clayton took a short slant 53-yards for a touchdown to make it 22-7.  Kolb drove Philadelphia to the Raven 1-yard line, but was intercepted in the end zone by Ed Reed, who returned the ball an NFL-record 108 yards for the touchdown.  Le'Ron McClain added a 1-yard touchdown run as Baltimore won 36-7.  Kolb was 10-for-23 for 73 yards and two interceptions, and Brian Westbrook had 39 yards rushing on 14 carries.

"The Eagles travelled to Dallas to take on the Cowboys, who were missing RB Ezekiel Elliott (Suspension), LT Tyron Smith (Groin), and LB Sean Lee (Hamstring). In a game that the Eagles were expected to dominate, the Eagles started off slow in the first half with Dallas leading 9-7 at halftime. Kicker Jake Elliott was ruled out for the game with a concussion, forcing the Eagles to use backup linebacker Kamu Grugier-Hill for kickoffs, and to go for two point conversions. The Eagles converted three of four two point conversions, as their touchdowns came on the ground from both Kenjon Barner and Corey Clement, and through the air, with Carson Wentz finding Torrey Smith for an 11-yard TD and Alshon Jeffery for a 17-yard TD on fourth down. Late in the fourth quarter, rookie defensive end Derek Barnett notched his 2nd sack of the game, a strip sack of Dak Prescott, leading to a Nigel Bradham 37 yard scoop and score. The Eagles harassed Dak Prescott all game, sacking him 4 times, intercepting him three times, and forcing one fumble.

"The February Revolution , known in Soviet historiography as the February Bourgeois Democratic Revolution, was the first of two revolutions which took place in Russia in 1917. The main events of the revolution took place in and near Petrograd , the then-capital of Russia, where longstanding discontent with the monarchy erupted into mass protests against food rationing on 23 February Old Style . Revolutionary activity lasted about eight days, involving mass demonstrations and violent armed clashes with police and gendarmes, the last loyal forces of the Russian monarchy. On 27 February O.S.  mutinous Russian Army forces sided with the revolutionaries. Three days later the Czar Nicholas II abdicated, ending Romanov dynastic rule and the Russian Empire. A Russian Provisional Government under Prince Georgy Lvov replaced the Russian Council of Ministers. The revolution appeared to break out without any real leadership or formal planning. Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems, which compounded after the start of World War I in 1914. Disaffected soldiers from the city's garrison joined bread rioters, primarily women in bread lines, and industrial strikers on the streets. As more and more troops deserted, and with loyal troops away at the Front, the city fell into chaos, leading to the overthrow of the Czar. In all, over 1,300 people were killed during the protests of February 1917.",a9ec90e23a0c50a741dc8d40c810c579,How many countries were involved?,1,2,naqanet,3041d124903002ea163b6b6fc904997c,How many revolutions took place in Russia in 1917,2,3,nabert,310cf05f104b5372fb4b2fe0119880b2,How many years after the start of WWI did The February Revolution take place?,3,-1917,naqanet,d3ebb6520009dc85d2826808445bdcad,How many years after the start of WWI did The February Revolution take place?,3,0.0,nabert,84d255ae872907803be434d3faddafd4,What was the ultimate outcome of troop desertion in the city?,the overthrow of the Czar,"social problems, which compounded after the start of World War I in 1914.

"The First Division under Konishi Yukinaga proceeded northward, and sacked Pyongsan, Sohung, Pungsan, Hwangju, and Chunghwa along the way. At Chunghwa, the Third Division under Kuroda Nagamasa joined the First, and continued to the city of Pyongyang located behind the Taedong River. A total of 10,000 Korean troops guarded the city against the 30,000 advancing Japanese. They were led by various commanders including the Generals Yi Il and Kim Myong-won, and their defense preparations had assured that no boats were available for Japanese use. At night, the Koreans silently crossed the river and launched a successful surprise attack against the Japanese encampment. However, this alerted the rest of the Japanese army, which attacked the rear of the Korean positions and destroyed the remaining reinforcements crossing the river. The remainder of the Korean troops then retreated back to Pyongyang, and the Japanese troops gave up their pursuit of the Koreans to observe the manner in which the Koreans had crossed the river. The next day, using what they had learned from observing the retreating Korean troops, the Japanese began sending troops to the other shore over the shallow points in the river, in a systematic manner, and at this sight the Koreans abandoned the city overnight. On July 20, 1592, the First and Third Divisions entered the deserted city of Pyongyang.

Fielding suggested that it probably had about 21,000 members in early 1975, of whom 6,000 to 8,000 were ""paper members"" who had not renewed their membership subscriptions but not officially terminated their membership. Searchlight claimed that from its origins with 4,000 members in 1968, the party reached a peak membership of 17,500 in 1972, which had declined to 10,000 in 1979, to 3,148 in 1984, and to 1,000 in January 1985. An estimate of party membership in 1989 put adherents of the Flag Group at about 3,000 and of the Strasserite faction at about 600. Thurlow noted that even at its peak in the 1970s, the Fronts membership was still only half the size of that of the BUF during its 1930s heyday.",f0160e4d6bae07085d6b9a4221f4a211,"According to Searchlight, in which years did the Flag group have 10000 or more members?",1972 1979,1985,nabert,6dfd8e9590e2f4c6b563a7db537bf5bb,"According to Searchlight, in which years did the Flag group have 10000 or more members?",1972 1979,members,naqanet,208b2d481699fd5b23a833dfeb39d829,"How many more members did the Front have in 1974 than in 1975, not including the highest estimate of ""paper members""",7000,15000.0,nabert,1fb47234c1a43131f803ba04c2d49fe5,"How many more members did the Front have in 1974 than in 1975, not including the highest estimate of ""paper members""",7000,2000,naqanet,a045144a5e742c2a2e3edf6940e89421,"How many more members did the Front have in 1974 than in 1975, not including the smallest estimate of ""paper members?""",5000,15000.0,nabert,846269268ca39833205feb355b8bd8f3,"How many more members did the Front have in 1974 than in 1975, not including the smallest estimate of ""paper members?""",5000,2000,naqanet,758ba4f2575246d4151ab15b43f183cb,How many more members did the party have in 1984 compare to 1985?,2148,6852,naqanet,db4ff9eccf7461f66879394f6dc658a4,How many more members was the NF claimed to have in 1974 compared to 1968?,16000,4000,naqanet,89e00739a3a45a72e9aa6eed3e6f6f0f,What group was twice as large as the Front?,BUF,Flag Group,naqanet,5890b455b1e1f197d7b80cc3712b6929,What group was twice as large as the Front?,BUF,strasserite faction,nabert,e8baadbf7d1e0610d386dfe57470f7af,"What year was the membership, according to the  of the Searchlight, for the Front closest to the membership total of the Flag Group in 1989?",1984,0,naqanet,e2e08b70eef6da24937f534ea2fc9848,"What year was the membership, according to the  of the Searchlight, for the Front closest to the membership total of the Flag Group in 1989?",1984,1985,nabert,44652980c7bf91785593de2a23e89bf6,"Which group had more members, The Fronts in the 1970s or the BUF in the 1930s?",BUF during its 1930s,The Fronts in the 1970s or the BUF in the 1930s,naqanet,c7eadcd20804ad20ff060ed1b116ad93,"Which group had more members, The Fronts in the 1970s or the BUF in the 1930s?",BUF during its 1930s,the fronts in the 1970s,nabert,716f995e80eaac9e3efdf0de8bd08e20,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Gdansk merchants had suffered a great deal from the blockade, especially because of lack of trade. In the meantime, Bathory also wanted to end the siege, as Ivan the Terrible of Muscovy broke a three-year truce in the same year and Muscovy tried to gain control of the eastern territories of the Commonwealth . The siege and all economic restrictions that were passed in the past two years were lifted in return for reparations and recognition of Bathory as the sovereign. Stefan forgave the city's rebellion and again turned Polish trade from Elbing to Danzig. The city, in turn, recognized him as ruler of Poland and promised to pay the large sum of 200,000 złotys and an additional 20,000 repatriation to the abbey of Oliwa in five years.

"The Giants and Falcons got off to a rough start, as each team turned the ball over twice in the first quarter. After Atlanta punted to start the game, Manning was intercepted by Demorrio Williams, but two minutes later, Michael Vick was intercepted by Sam Madison. After forcing a Giants punt, Vick fumbled, with Madison recovering. Manning threw another pick on the next drive, this time to DeAngelo Hall. Looking to break the game open in the second half, the Falcons turned to Warrick Dunn, who busted through a huge hole en route to a 90-yard touchdown run, the longest in Atlanta history.  The score put the Falcons up 14-3, but Big Blue took command after that.  Seizing control, the Giants used the legs of Barber and some fine passing from Manning to get back into the game.  An 84-yard drive was finished with a two yard plunge by Brandon Jacobs.  After an Atlanta three and out, the Giants again drove the length of the field, with Barber leading the charge.  Eli Manning finished off the 91 yard scamper with a short play-action touchdown to tight end Jeremy Shockey. The Giants would utilize a heavy pass rush to force the Falcons to punt again and after a Jay Feely field goal from 39 yards, the offense put the game away.  Manning hit Shockey on another touchdown late, finishing off the Falcons.  For the day, Manning was 17 of 30 for 180 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.  Barber rushed for 185 yards and Jacobs added 53.  Shockey re-emerged in this game with six receptions, including the two touchdowns.  Defensively, the Giants recorded seven sacks including two from Osi Umenyiora and linebacker Brandon Short.  Cornerback Sam Madison who had a rough start to the season had the interception against Vick and recovered his fumble in the first quarter.

"The Guarani refused to accept Portuguese rule and refused to leave the mission settlements. In 1754 Spanish and Portuguese military forces were dispatched to force the Guarani to leave the area. There was inconclusive fighting throughout 1754 between Guarani rebels under Sepé Tiaraju and the combined Portuguese and Spanish forces commanded by Freire de Andrade.

"The Guatemalan authorities were unaware of ongoing contacts between the colonial authorities in Yucatán and the Itza. In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator.

"The Guatemalan authorities were unaware of ongoing contacts between the colonial authorities in Yucatán and the Itza. In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal.

"The Kiev uprising of 1068 was a revolt against Grand Prince Iziaslav Yaroslavich of Kiev in the aftermath of a Kievan Rus' defeat at the hands of the Cumans at Battle of the Alta River near the city of Pereiaslavl, southeast of Kiev. The Polovtsy raid of 1068-1069 was only the tribe's second major raid into Rus'  in 1055, but the tribesmen broke the treaty and attacked Kievan Rus' six years later, defeating Vsevolod in battle).  In 1068-1069, the Polovtsy penetrated the earthwork defensive lines built up over the years by Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavich  and his son, Yaroslav the Wise .  They were met by a combined army of Yaroslav's sons: Grand Prince Iziaslav of Kiev and his brothers, Princes Sviatoslav Yaroslavich of Chernigov, and Vsevolod, which was defeated and fled back to Kiev in disarray. The Polovsty continued to raid throughout the area, prompting the Kievans to call on the grand prince to rearm them so they could march out and meet the threat.  Iziaslav refused, prompting the rebellion.

"The Kingdom of Hungary , also known as the Regency, existed from 1920 to 1946 as a de factonote 1 country under Regent Miklós Horthy. Horthy officially represented the Hungarian monarchy of Charles IV, Apostolic King of Hungary. Attempts by Charles IV to return to the throne were prevented by threats of war from neighbouring countries and by the lack of support from Horthy. The country has been regarded by some historians to have been a client state of Germany from 1938 to 1944. The Kingdom of Hungary under Horthy was an Axis Power during most of World War II.  In 1944, after Horthy's government negotiated secretly with the Allies, and considered to leave the war as well, Hungary was occupied by Nazi Germany and Horthy was deposed. The Arrow Cross Party's leader Ferenc Szálasi established a new Nazi-backed government, effectively turning Hungary into a German-occupied puppet state. After World War II, Hungary fell within the Soviet Union's sphere of interest. In 1946, the Second Hungarian Republic was established under Soviet influence. In 1949, the communist Hungarian People's Republic was founded.",f925f68592d37be1c722677bf3cccda7,"The Soviet Union did NOT become interested in which region after the end of World War II, Germany or Hungary?",Germany,Hungary,naqanet,12313744680637fc073233d1b7ffb3f0,What stopped Charles IV from returning to the throne,threats of war,Horthy,naqanet,6aedd996971ef84902edee02ceed5c81,"Which happened last, the Second Hungarian Republic was established, or Hungary being occupied by Nazi Germany and Horthy was deposed?",Second Hungarian Republic was established,Hungary being occupied by Nazi Germany and Horthy was deposed,naqanet,6d4e642070c254edd5781a2ea6cc3116,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Kuwait-Najd War erupted in the aftermath of World War I. The war occurred because Ibn Saud wanted to annex Kuwait.

"The Lions were attempting to end a 21-game regular season losing streak at Green Bay's Lambeau Field, but were hampered by injuries to starting wide receivers Nate Burleson and Calvin Johnson, neither of whom could suit up for the game. Neither offense could get much going in the first half.  Mason Crosby converted field goals of 26 and 52 yards for the Packers, while David Akers hit a 53-yarder for the Lions, making the halftime score 6-3 in favor of Green Bay. Crosby connected again in the third quarter on a 31-yard field goal. The big blow of the game came just 1:26 later, when Aaron Rodgers found James Jones deep, resulting in an 83-yard touchdown and a 16-3 Green Bay lead. Two more Crosby field goals of 42 and 45 yards put the game out of reach.

"The Long Turkish War or Thirteen Years' War was an indecisive land war between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire, primarily over the Principalities of Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia. It was waged from 1593 to 1606 but in Europe it is sometimes called the Fifteen Years War, reckoning from the 1591-92 Turkish campaign that captured Bihać.

"The NBA had a salary cap in the mid-1940s, but it was abolished after only one season. The league continued to operate without such a cap until 1984-85 NBA season, when one was instituted in an attempt to level the playing field among all of the NBAs teams and ensure competitive balance for the Association in the future. Before the cap was reinstated, teams could spend whatever amount of money they wanted on players, but in the first season under the new cap, they were each limited to $3.6 million in total payroll. Under the 2005 NBA collective bargaining agreement, salaries were capped at 57 percent of basketball-related income (BRI) and lasted for six years until June 30, 2011. The next CBA, which took effect in 2011-12, set the cap at 51.2 percent of BRI in 2011-12, with a 49-to-51 band in subsequent years.

"The Ogaden War was a Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden starting with the Somali Democratic Republic's invasion of Ethiopia. The Soviet Union disapproved of the invasion and ceased its support of Somalia to instead start supporting Ethiopia, whereas the United States conversely ceased its support of Ethiopia and started supporting Somalia. Ethiopia was saved from a major defeat and a permanent loss of territory due to a massive airlift of military supplies , the arrival of 16,000 Cuban troops, 1,500 Soviet advisors and 2 brigades from South Yemen, also airlifted to reinforce Harar. The Ethiopians prevailed at Harar, Dire Dawa, Jijiga and began to push the Somalis out of the Ogaden systematically. By March 1978, the Ethiopians had captured almost all of the Ogaden, prompting the defeated Somalis to give up their claim to the region. With 1/3 of the initial Somali National Army invasion force killed and 1/2 of the Somali Airforce destroyed, the war left Somalia with a disorganized and demoralized army and an angry population. All of these conditions led to a revolt in the army which eventually spiraled into a civil war and Somalia's current situation.",51dfac45c2ce865fd4e2da52f96154c8,HO wmany troops arived from Cuba?,16000,"16 , 000 cuban troops",nabert,e136f5b67790ab50c0147d1fc6ac7bd4,HO wmany troops arived from Cuba?,16000,massive airlift of military supplies,naqanet,a4b6bbc829452c84ebc8b91f49c16856,How many cities were the Ethiopians successful in?,4,2,naqanet,9cd216533dc660d90d69dc17ba95e9b9,How many countries supported Ethiopia?,3,2,naqanet,1d429608053e1ba2535c6b565239cde0,How many months did the Ogaden War last?,8,2,naqanet,b779131fc19e35e135e17549148b133d,How many months did the Ogaden War last?,8,3,nabert,bd2d05a614ee9023852f54f898705cbe,Was more of the initial Somali National Army force killed or were more of the Somali Air-force destroyed?,Somali Airforce,National Army invasion force killed,naqanet,8529ee96bbb745339cd5c6c03df78ab1,Was more of the initial Somali National Army force killed or were more of the Somali Air-force destroyed?,Somali Airforce,killed,nabert,3c4cc2e966ddc3880408991d7d4481ab,"Which country did the US support, Somalia or Ethiopia?",Somalia,ethiopia,nabert,dee8551f8abacdc319124ff88c91406b,"Which did the Somalis lose more from, Somali National Army or Somali Airforce?",Somali Airforce,Somali National Army or Somali Airforce,naqanet,a2daa71a08554eabaf8042b5943ee9b8,"Which did the Somalis lose more from, Somali National Army or Somali Airforce?",Somali Airforce,somali national army,nabert,0683842f720b6dca20f563f6007136d4,"Which event happened first, the United States started supporting Somalia or the when the Ethiopians forced the Somalis to give up their claim to Ogaden?",United States started supporting Somalia,United States,naqanet,3e4c387da8415572c607a8caa9f25ae5,"Which event happened first, the United States started supporting Somalia or the when the Ethiopians forced the Somalis to give up their claim to Ogaden?",United States started supporting Somalia,support of somalia to instead start supporting ethiopia,nabert,fa4d8af88a69c94fd1dedd1afbb83b6c,"Which event happened first, the United States started supporting Somalia or the when the Ethiopians forced the Somalis to give up their claim to the region?",United States started supporting Somalia,United States,naqanet,bfcec31f68f0b4b5f15beaea73b48ae0,"Which event happened first, the United States started supporting Somalia or the when the Ethiopians forced the Somalis to give up their claim to the region?",United States started supporting Somalia,supporting ethiopia,nabert,73ac254d8dffa5aae0f619789a570ad8,Who did the Soviet Union support during the Ogaden War?,Ethiopia,"Somalia to instead start supporting Ethiopia, whereas the United States",naqanet,d8d583ffa4e39f265d54ce72de9a9155,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"The Redskins donned their burgundy uniforms and played at home against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a special pre-election day edition of Monday Night Football. The Steelers opened the game with a failed onside kick attempt which gave the Redskins position at their opponent's 41-yard line. The drive ended with a Shaun Suisham field goal. The Redskins regained possession on a tipped Ben Roethlisberger pass that was intercepted by Cornelius Griffin early in the first quarter. The drive resulted in another field goal giving Washington a 6-0 lead over the Steelers. In the second quarter, Steelers' Jeff Reed scored on a 35-yard field goal. Pittsburgh took the lead as they turned a blocked Ryan Plackemeier punt attempt into a 1-yard touchdown run by Roethlisberger, who exited the game following the score due to an injury to his shoulder and would not return. In the second half, Byron Leftwich entered the game for the injured Roethlisberger. Pittsburgh rusher Willie Parker ran for a touchdown in the third quarter (with a failed extra point). Early in the fourth quarter, Leftwich completed a 5-yard touchdown reception to Santonio Holmes, giving the Steelers a 23-6 lead. Jason Campbell appeared to score a rushing touchdown later in the quarter but the ruling was reversed on a Pittsburgh challenge. Byron Leftwich played for only one half and threw for 129 yards. Clinton Portis was held to 51 yards rushing. Jason Campbell was sacked seven times.

After that, Russian forces marched on Swedish Livonia and besieged Riga in the Russo-Swedish War of 1656-1658, a theater of the Second Northern War. Khmelnytsky was not against this temporary truce and supported the Tsar though he warned him of Polish furtiveness. Ivan Vyhovsky, the newly elected hetman in 1657 upon the death of Khmelnytsky, allied himself with the Poles in Sept. 1658, creating the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia.  However, the Cossacks were also beset with the start of a civil war with this Commonwealth treaty and a new Treaty of Pereyaslav with Russia in 1659. The Tsar concluded with Sweden the advantageous Treaty of Valiersar, which allowed him to resume hostilities against the Poles in October 1658, capturing Wincenty Gosiewski at the Battle of Werki.  In the north, Sapieha's attempt to blockade Vilnius was checked by Prince Yury Dolgorukov  on October 11. In the south, the Ukrainian Vyhovsky failed to wrest Kiev from Sheremetev's control where Russians kept their garrison. In July 1659, however, Vyhovsky and his Crimean Tatar allies inflicted a heavy defeat upon Trubetskoy's army, then besieging Konotop.",6e16986c42777eec18ef35c6237b6a07,What country did King Charles X rule over in 1655?,Sweden,Poland,naqanet,0b97b489c40987332843d0e66d83f2c6,"What happened first, the Russian advance into Poland-Lithuania or the Swedish invasion of Poland?",Russian advance into Poland-Lithuania,Sweden invading Poland,naqanet,3dcb7e02025b97bce5b060f74eb20a02,What happened second: kingdom of Sweden invading Poland or Vyhovsky defeating Trubetskoy's army?,Vyhovsky defeating Trubetskoy's army,vyhovsky defeating trubetskoy ' s army,nabert,b13afcc94c68f581e47db17e6fc9980a,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Sack of Brescia took place on February 18, 1512 during the War of the League of Cambrai. The city of Brescia had revolted against French control, garrisoning itself with Venetian troops. Gaston de Foix, recently arrived to command the French armies in Italy, ordered the city to surrender; when it refused, he attacked it with around 12,000 men. The French attack took place in a pouring rain, through a field of mud; Foix ordered his men to remove their shoes for better traction. The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the French, but were eventually overrun, suffering 8,000 - 15,000 casualties. The Gascon infantry and landsknechts then proceeded to thoroughly sack the city, massacring thousands of civilians over the next five days.

"The Serbian army emerged victorious, although details of the actual battle are vague. Şahin Bey entered Serbia with 20.000 akinjis at that time he learned that Serbian lords had prepared an army to attack his troops. He advanced to Pločnik near Prokuplje but could not detect the position of that army, and believed that there was none. At that time, many akinjis  lost their temper and began looting civilian properties in the surrounding villages by disobeying orders. Şahin Bey stayed alone with 2,000 soldiers. On the other hand, the battlefield was observed by Serbian expeditionary forces. Suddenly an allied army with 30,000 soldiers appeared, many of whom were cavalry. The Serbian army used heavy knight cavalry charge with horse archers on the flanks. The Serbs first attacked the Ottoman center , although they were unprepared and tasted nasty shock to heavy Serbian knights, the outnumbered Ottoman center resisted for some time but later began to withdraw with Şahin Bey who barely escaped with his life. Then the Serbian army turned to the other 18,000 akinjis that were busy plundering; unprepared, ill-disciplined, surprised akinjis couldn't do anything without their general. Only 5,000 of them returned home alive. More than 60% of the Ottoman army was destroyed. According to tradition Serbian knight and folk hero Miloš Obilić participated in this battle and distinguished himself, and was wounded by an Ottoman arrow. According to some, such as Croatian historian Vjekoslav Klaić, Lazar's army was aided by Bosnian troops. One version of the battle has it that the battle was won thanks to the Bosnian troops and the trickery of a Kastrioti.",2f86991fcbdd0f50eaca554e673d2012,How many more Serbian army members where there than how many Sahin Bey entered Serbia with?,10000,-1980.0,nabert,dae69b47c4a324519b1fc343fd333a7f,How many more Serbian army members where there than how many Sahin Bey entered Serbia with?,10000,-2000,naqanet,802703ca6959d39d728248b5530e62f2,How many of Sahin Beys men became angry and began looting civilian properties?,18000,1,nabert,557abc8be29c6d47dcb0ce20235f98d9,How many of Sahin Beys men became angry and began looting civilian properties?,18000,7000,naqanet,4b92a025149832b00920248ae58e81d6,What were the akinjis doing that ultimately got most of them killed?,plundering,without their general,naqanet,c290dd6f11bdbde8a461b8c503455f52,Where did Şahin Bey believe there were no troops?,Pločnik near Prokuplje,plocnik,nabert,1fd62c6d84fac77108cf6fcca36867ce,Where did Şahin Bey believe there were no troops?,Pločnik near Prokuplje,withdraw,naqanet,4a898e09d7564f943699a55cd97217fb,"Which happened first, Sahin Bey entering Serbia or his advancement to",Pločnik,sahin bey entered serbia,nabert,6284bf4c68a5688ec93942b3c0ab726f,"Which happened first, Sahin Bey entering Serbia or his advancement to",Pločnik,Şahin Bey entered Serbia,naqanet,39d1d9f67462bdf7591f5292c748bd97,"Which happened first, Sahin Bey entering Serbia or his advancement to Pločnik",Sahin Bey entering Serbia,sahin bey entered serbia,nabert,7272c70f4e6cb1e7ab5aea1d54309339,"Which happened first, Sahin Bey entering Serbia or his advancement to Pločnik",Sahin Bey entering Serbia,Şahin Bey entered Serbia,naqanet,de8b4f907d8ff91feae9cb1cfc943031,Who disobeyed orders?,akinjis,sahin bey,nabert,567d293b904f6359caaf1c3482cf6cd8,Who disobeyed orders?,akinjis,Şahin Bey,naqanet,72113a2f9a867f9fef5aa6a874eb0065,Who were the Serbs fighting against?,Ottoman army,"allied army with 30 , 000 soldiers appeared , many of whom were cavalry . the serbian army used heavy knight cavalry charge with horse archers on the flanks . the serbs first attacked the ottoman center , although they were unprepared and tasted nasty shock to heavy serbian knights",nabert,51b359a683fd48014f25356ca5987fa4,Who were the Serbs fighting against?,Ottoman army,knight cavalry,naqanet,3c2c5c4324c9f5fe1f4aac9e6caf82be,who helped the Serbians?,Bosnian troops,Serbian expeditionary forces,naqanet,a7a6d9175a7e944cbfcb621a077bc552,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Siege of Vienna in 1529 was the first attempt by the Ottoman Empire, led by Suleiman the Magnificent, to capture the city of Vienna, Austria. The siege signalled the pinnacle of the Ottoman Empire's power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe. Thereafter, 150 years of bitter military tension and reciprocal attacks ensued, culminating in the Battle of Vienna of 1683, which marked the start of the 15-year-long Great Turkish War. The inability of the Ottomans to capture Vienna in 1529 turned the tide against almost a century of conquest throughout eastern and central Europe. The Ottoman Empire had previously annexed Central Hungary and established a vassal state in Transylvania in the wake of the Battle of Mohács. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, ""The failure of the first  brought to a standstill the tide of Ottoman conquest which had been flooding up the Danube Valley for a century past."" There is speculation by some historians that Suleiman's main objective in 1529 was actually to assert Ottoman control over the whole of Hungary, the western part of which  was under Habsburg control. The decision to attack Vienna after such a long interval in Suleiman's European campaign is viewed as an opportunistic manoeuvre after his decisive victory in Hungary. Other scholars theorise that the suppression of Hungary simply marked the prologue to a later, premeditated invasion of Europe.",1f0714785c58f612abae9a003b9614b2,How many countries were involved in the Great Turkish War?,2,3,naqanet,bf2e9cf5bcf80421db5d0bdea7e7f83d,How many years was there fighting over Vienna till the end of the Great Turkish War?,169,1668.0,nabert,d2779a9e365a20abe27ce3b6542dbb61,How many years was there fighting over Vienna till the end of the Great Turkish War?,169,1683,naqanet,3c2cbb5d73a6aa920933834df2e18734,What battle started first: Battle of Vienna or Battle of Mohács?,Battle of Mohács,Battle of Vienna,naqanet,637ee18059b9f32d5a8af966c71aae68,What battle started last: Battle of Vienna or Battle of Mohács?,Battle of Vienna,Battle of Mohács,naqanet,f08cd2ac9e631d1d6e1816925072f3cf,What battle started last: Battle of Vienna or Battle of Mohács?,Battle of Vienna,battle of mohacs,nabert,44e2e8fda8f8613772fa7d12767d09c0,What country had the Ottoman Empire established a vassal state in?,Central Hungary,Austria,naqanet,626069b26029540a1fce41ed3e31eb1e,What country had the Ottoman Empire established a vassal state in?,Central Hungary,transylvania,nabert,fb021386c324a0d90a74504afb635a74,What was Suleiman's  main objective in 1529,assert Ottoman control,assert Ottoman,naqanet,86fcef1c291024f3d347a0df20e81f0f,What was Suleiman's  main objective in 1529,assert Ottoman control,to assert ottoman control,nabert,b6f3dd18455b0288c922c97e63afb9e9,What year did the Great Turkish War end?,1698,1668,naqanet,cf71fd66be1c636751230b49ec6e6ab2,When did the Great Turkish War end?,1698,1668,naqanet,93be561b3e2cd65576fc759f07f312d6,When did the Great Turkish War end?,1698,1683,nabert,deee960812fa7cdd559a36a5e26e0bde,"Which happened first, the Siege of Vienna or the Battle of Vienna?",Siege of Vienna in 1529 Battle of Vienna of 1683,Siege of Vienna,naqanet,8e73e34269b096e259bb6c27a86e98e6,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic.",ff2384773a25d5b7a28ee464769d79d6,How many years did it take for the population to decrease to about 1100 from 10000?,36,28,naqanet,1ddc59f01aa2b2c159537d5d0caee5e7,How many years did it take for the population to decrease to about 1100 from 10000?,36,8.0,nabert,845e4e7103645934ed5c79bcbb3eab70,What was a danger of living in the coastal reducciones?,contagious European diseases,Spanish administration,naqanet,91ed36e8674ce366fc86071c5328e568,What was a danger of living in the coastal reducciones?,contagious European diseases,pirate attacks,nabert,f5b7b844120e186a1a1866eb72ce8ce4,What were the settlements the Spanish established called?,reducciones,colonial towns,naqanet,97c80d3190792ad7223ef926a9f9316e,Which population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast?,Acalan,hernan cortes,nabert,43531e433f9425b13b762ac6dac7d71a,"Which year had the largest population recorded, 1525 or 1553?",1525,1553,naqanet,b5b96ea0d6e421f48cac068b310390de,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Steelers began their anniversary season on the road against their AFC North foe, the Cleveland Browns, for Round 1 of the 2007 Rust Belt series.  Also, with both teams at 55 wins a piece, the Steelers would take the lead in the rivalry for the first time in the 57-year history of the rivalry. Pittsburgh got off to a fast start in the first quarter as QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Hines Ward. Later, kicker Jeff Reed made a 26-yard field goal, while Roethlisberger completed a 40-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes.  After a scoreless second quarter, the Steelers went right back to work in the third quarter, as Roethlisberger completed a 5-yard TD pass to rookie TE Matt Spaeth.  Afterwards, the Browns got their only score of the game as QB Derek Anderson completed a 1-yard TD pass to FB Lawrence Vickers.  Pittsburgh put the game well out of reach as Roethlisberger threw his career-best 4th touchdown pass of the game, a 22-yard strike to TE Heath Miller.

"The Steelers started their 2014 season at home against the Browns.  In the first quarter, the Steelers would score first when Shaun Suisham kicked a 36-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  However, the Browns were able to tie it up when Billy Cundiff kicked a 39-yard field goal for a 3-3 game.  The Steelers would score 24 unanswered points to end the first half with LaGarrette Blount running for a 7-yard TD to retake the lead 10-3.  In the 2nd quarter, the Steelers continued their domination when Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 35-yard TD for a 17-3 lead followed by Le'Veon Bell running in for a TD from 38 yards out to increase their lead to 24-3 followed by Suisham nailing yet another field goal from 34 yards out as they led 27-3 at halftime.

Regardless, Roethlisberger was able to move his team down the field and eventually, Suisham kicked the game-winning 41-yard field goal to win it 30-27 for the Steelers' only 3 points of the 2nd half.

"The Steelers went back home for another showdown with the Patriots. This game is notable for being the very first game that QB Ben Roethlisberger would miss out on against the Patriots. In the first quarter, The Patriots scored first when Tom Brady found James White on a 19-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, they increased their lead when LaGarrette Blount ran for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 14-0. The Steelers got on the board later on in the quarter when Landry Jones found Darrius Heyward-Bey on a 14-yard touchdown pass for a 14-7 game. The Steelers closed out the scoring of the first half when Chris Boswell kicked a 32-yard field goal for a 14-10 game at halftime. In the third quarter, the Steelers went back to work as Boswell kicked another field goal to get his team within 1, 14-13 from 46 yards out. The Pats pulled away later on when Brady found Rob Gronkowski on a 36-yard touchdown pass (with a failed PAT) for a 20-13 game. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers came within 4 again when Boswell made a 44-yard field goal for a 20-16 game. But the Pats sealed the game after Blount ran for a 5-yard touchdown and the eventual final score of 27-16. With the loss, the Steelers went into their bye week at 4-3. Regardless, due to the Ravens' loss to the Jets, they still remain in first place in the AFC North.

"The U.S. Marine Corps issued a request for proposals (RFP) in 2013 for its Humvee sustainment modification initiative to upgrade 6,700 expanded capacity vehicles (ECVs). The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018. Older A2 series Humvees make up half the current fleet, and 4,000 are to be disposed of through foreign military sales and transfers.

"The conflict between Novgorod and Teutonic Knights began in 1210, when the knights attacked the Estonians. Novgorod campaigned against the Livonians in 1217, 1219, 1222, and 1223, facing repeated failure. In 1224, the knights captured Dorpat . Soon after the capture of Dorpat, an internal conflict arose in Novgorod. The townspeople refused to help in the fight against the knights. Soon, a split occurred among the Novgorod nobles. Expelled from the city, the nobles and the Knights captured Izborsk in 1233, but soon were expelled from the city by the Pskov army. A year later, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich of Novgorod returned to the Livonian lands and devastated the outskirts of the town Odenpa, triumphing over Emajõe and forcing the Livonians to sign a peace agreement. In 1236, Lithuania had lost a Great Master of the Order of the Sword Volquin von Winterstein, and Pope Gregory IX gave his consent to the Union of the Order of the Sword with the Teutonic Knights. The master of the Order was Hermann von Balk. In December 1237, Pope Gregory IX proclaimed the second crusade against Finland. Danish king Waldemar II and the joint Masters of the Order agreed to divide Estonia and attacked Baltic Russia in June 1238 in collaboration with the Swedes.

"The country's economic transformation was far from complete. Political and financial crises in 1997, shattered the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May. The formerly pegged currency was forced into a floating system as investors sold their Korunas faster than the government could buy them. This followed a worldwide trend to divest from developing countries that year. Investors also worried the republic's economic transformation was far from complete. Another complicating factor was the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of GDP. In response to the crisis, two austerity packages were introduced later in the spring , which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. Growth dropped to 0.3% in 1997, −2.3% in 1998, and −0.5% in 1999. The government established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a revitalization program - to spur the sale of firms to foreign companies. Key priorities included accelerating legislative convergence with EU norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatising banks and utilities. The economy, fueled by increased export growth and investment, was expected to recover by 2000.",815452c7304835166c9c331e5bf9432a,How many key priorities were introduced in the 1999 revitalization program?,3,4,nabert,7a79885a6481e18f3ab0bc40aabbb6b1,How many percentage points did GDP growth drop from 1997 to 1999?,3.1,2,naqanet,874f6f0cf4167024c30788d113f523ba,How many percentage points did GDP growth drop from 1997 to 1999?,3.1,2.2,nabert,c7b9226660c4c148546b67b9c32cd02b,How many percentage points did growth drop from 1997 to 1998?,2,99.7,nabert,c67a2bb33af96c0ce65b67c7d49a88b8,How many sectors did the country want to privatize in the 1999 revitalization program?,2,3,naqanet,0bd274c994e1871fe7d24a6d2e8b3724,How many years in a row did the GDP growth decrease?,3,-1997,naqanet,77dfafdcbd85f070d6aba6395ef2fc7a,How many years in a row did the GDP growth decrease?,3,4,nabert,9b04c3693835889f1a1f7850bcd08829,How many years in a row did the GDP growth fall  into negatives?,2,-1,naqanet,32ca2e2c076099ef6d2640b2cffb25fd,How many years in a row did the GDP growth fall  into negatives?,2,4,nabert,e20f52440397140ec10063ce3af6abef,"In which year did GDP growth drop the least, 1997, 1998, or 1999?",1997,1998,nabert,7c61a865ee2b03df44ec2e173d737d28,"In which year did GDP growth drop the least, 1997, 1998, or 1999?",1997,1999,naqanet,4e044ea28f5c23260c93a60ba4ef6932,What could have been done to avoid the crisis?,enterprise restructuring,austerity packages,naqanet,9d67e27f0312c52463f79b644a4f2927,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort inline, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season.

"The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort inline, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270 km south.

"The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunter-gatherer. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.",018feb6b0e878a10c8c7ac278513cfa2,How many animals originate from Andes of South America?,3,0,naqanet,b1dd640b35db8d26a84d83f3e0ec8bc8,How many animals originate from Andes of South America?,3,5,nabert,de44cef7bf229b4a63dd971caee47424,How many things originated from the Andes of South America?,6,3,naqanet,bb4fad83c2e1bf961dae60ec033f43d8,How many things originated from the Andes of South America?,6,5,nabert,2352c8c5c6808fb6cb979dd7171fa4b6,"How many years after wild grains began being harvested was the potato domesticated, at its earliest?",95000,0,naqanet,2bbfdc23e29c0bf92fbcb8963b864c79,How many years passed between the cultivation of maize and the next most recent crop?,400,11500,naqanet,a2593c6f73b70b64dce123da7d0fedf8,How many years passed between the cultivation of maize and the next most recent crop?,400,300.0,nabert,005de5f845e87c52eb1efbeda0c015e1,Which animal was cultivated earliest?,Sheep,Rice,naqanet,e302e1a01e3d394168531defc7a24193,Which animal was cultivated earliest?,Sheep,rye,nabert,ffc290ce750ff623718a90e2562e9986,Which animals were domesticated in different parts of the world at approximately the same time?,Cattle wild boar,guinea,naqanet,c425fc032ed6abeac7dc01e49672aacf,Which animals were domesticated in different parts of the world at approximately the same time?,Cattle wild boar,sheep,nabert,11b654cdee5034ef248d6ec8a9b12e21,Which crop was likely cultivated first?,Wild grains,rye,nabert,77523233cf8977307429fe31d754e90b,Which crops were cultivated in China?,Rice mung bean soy Azuki bean beans,chick peas and flax,naqanet,b78f1d497b300b60b166fcbdfe6c98e6,Which crops were cultivated in China?,Rice mung bean soy Azuki bean beans,rice,nabert,7699cb54217a4689e1c5e4558890d4cc,Which of the crops mentioned was domesticated the second-most recently?,maize,cattle,nabert,ac7c2ae75f925e7afc015d5f0bb73299,Which of the crops mentioned was domesticated the second-most recently?,maize,einkorn wheat,naqanet,bff04fa8ae6a4b2732259cffc49e999d,"Which two regions domesticated cotton, Peru and Eurasia or Peru and Mesoamerica?",Peru Eurasia,Peru and Eurasia,naqanet,2a5619e768487fac66a45588b4d92d99,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The disintegration of Russia offered Finns an historic opportunity to gain national independence. After the October Revolution, the conservatives were eager for secession from Russia in order to control the left and minimise the influence of the Bolsheviks. The socialists were skeptical about sovereignty under conservative rule, but they feared a loss of support among nationalistic workers, particularly after having promised increased national liberty through the ""Law of Supreme Power"". Eventually, both political factions supported an independent Finland, despite strong disagreement over the composition of the nation's leadership. Nationalism had become a ""civic religion"" in Finland by the end of nineteenth century, but the goal during the general strike of 1905 was a return to the autonomy of 1809-1898, not full independence. In comparison to the unitary Swedish regime, the domestic power of Finns had increased under the less uniform Russian rule. Economically, the Grand Duchy of Finland benefited from having an independent domestic state budget, a central bank with national currency, the markka , and customs organisation and the industrial progress of 1860-1916. The economy was dependent on the huge Russian market and separation would disrupt the profitable Finnish financial zone. The economic collapse of Russia and the power struggle of the Finnish state in 1917 were among the key factors that brought sovereignty to the fore in Finland.",d43f9bf834f29fce5b7ca177ebd33c4c,Finland was supported by whom?,both political factions,Nationalism,naqanet,3e8a5f564322ec974ddcefb3d8fb2366,Finland was supported by whom?,both political factions,socialists,nabert,fe7702ae6189b8cf47ae74e1debc02ff,How many years did autonomy and industrial progress overlap?,38,56,naqanet,ae2f440b68b87ab27c10a94a11a696f3,"What happened first, the economic collapse of Russia of the general strike in Finland?",the general strike,autonomy of 1809-1898,naqanet,84d8d36f99e0c619815930c81f71787f,"What happened first, the economic collapse of Russia of the general strike in Finland?",the general strike,economic collapse of russia,nabert,c7366d8c5834b096f40fd9731e5509f9,What made sovereignty important in Finland again?,economic collapse of Russia struggle of the Finnish state,conservative rule,naqanet,f776d770e21d09c5562a5353d82f502b,What made sovereignty important in Finland again?,economic collapse of Russia struggle of the Finnish state,economic collapse of russia and the power struggle of the finnish state,nabert,89fa969a9c34982cbc0a2517f3e68fe8,What was the economy dependent on,the huge Russian market,"central bank with national currency, the markka , and customs organisation and the industrial progress of 1860-1916.

It moved to Fort Chaffee on 15 March 1942 to make way for other Armored units, and then completed its assembly and unit training. The division then participated in the VIII Corps (United States) Louisiana Maneuvers from 25 August 1942, and then returned to Camp Chaffee on 21 September 1942. The 6th AD then moved to Camp Young at the National Training Center on 10 October 1942, and participated in the first California Maneuvers.

"The fact that the Irish Civil War was fought between Irish Nationalist factions meant that the sporadic conflict in Northern Ireland ended. Collins and Sir James Craig signed an agreement to end it on 30 March 1922, but, despite this, Collins covertly supplied arms to the Northern IRA until a week before his death in August 1922. Because of the Irish Civil War, Northern Ireland was able to consolidate its existence and the partition of Ireland was confirmed for the foreseeable future. The continuing war also confirmed the northern Unionists' existing prejudices against the ethos of all shades of nationalism. This might have led to open hostilities between North and South had the Irish Civil War not broken out. Indeed, the Ulster Special Constabulary  that had been established in 1920  was expanded in 1922 rather than being demobilised. In the event, it was only well after their defeat in the Civil War that anti-treaty Irish Republicans seriously considered whether to take armed action against British rule in Northern Ireland . The northern units of the IRA largely supported the Free State side in the Civil War because of Collins's policies, and over 500 of them joined the new Free State's National Army. The cost of the war and the budget deficit it caused was a difficulty for the new Free State and affected the Boundary Commission negotiations of 1925, which were to determine the border with Northern Ireland. The Free State agreed to waive its claim to predominantly Nationalist areas in Northern Ireland and in return its agreed share of the Imperial debt under the 1921 Treaty was not paid.",4e5629b1ed60d7787df53630834e780a,How many months after Collins signed the agreement did he die?,5,2,naqanet,a79c581b5aef2d1df530740c2bd88917,How many months after Collins signed the agreement did he die?,5,3,nabert,23a740aff473ec24e72d0ff8c87bbfd7,How many months after Sir James Craig signed an agreement to end the conflict in Northern Ireland did he parish?,5,2,naqanet,c7ed2d6701dc80d155c22d5492e7e6e3,How many months after signing the agreement did Collins die?,5,2,naqanet,9d7b3b561cfdb49b0d16207206cd5c9d,How many months after signing the agreement did Collins die?,5,4,nabert,ae268f5ff4d0a94dc7c40caf5fc1743d,How many months did Collins covertly supply arms to the IRA after he signed an agreement to end the conflict?,5,2,naqanet,b9e8885087850a65e29f8f5904aea420,How many months did Collins covertly supply arms to the IRA after he signed an agreement to end the conflict?,5,3,nabert,53d2333b50a5dcb28802a1bd39b7c68c,How many years did these events span for?,5,3,naqanet,acf3e22a30d3b5376e2c23a2737dd092,Ulster Special Constabulary that had been established in 1920 was expanded how many years later?,2,3.0,nabert,8319c6ac5b0664db160705bb6164c10e,"What event happened first, James Craig signing an agreement, or the Ulster Special Constabulary?",Ulster Special Constabulary that had been established in 1920,James Craig signed an agreement,naqanet,a93e8f6c7fbc646eebacbddee6debc50,"Which happened first, the 1921 Treaty or the Boundary Commission negotiations?",1921 Treaty,Boundary Commission negotiations of 1925,naqanet,eccf7d7ac9522ed63f61d7a9b623061c,Who's imperial debt share never got paid because they agreed to waive their claim to Nationalist areas in Northern Ireland instead?,The Free State,Sir James Craig,naqanet,0ac0db250dae7cc5a59e269491a46a0f,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The first 30 sports were announced by the Singapore National Olympic Council on 10 December 2013 on the sidelines of the 27th SEA Games in Myanmar. It announced then that there was room for as many as eight more sports. On 29 April 2014, the final six sports, namely boxing, equestrian, floorball, petanque, rowing and volleyball were added to the programme. Floorball will feature in the event for the first time after being a demonstration sport in the 2013 edition. In its selection of events, the organising committee indicated their desire to set a model for subsequent games in trimming the number of ""traditional"" sports to refocus on the SEAG's initial intent to increase the level of sporting excellence in key sports. Hence, despite room for up to eight traditional sports, only two, floorball and netball, were included in the programme. Amongst the other 34 sports, 24 are Olympic sports and all remaining sports are featured in the Asian Games.

"The first Azov campaign began in the spring of 1695. Peter the Great ordered his army  to advance towards Azov. The army comprised crack regiments and the Don Cossacks and was divided into three units under the command of Franz Lefort, Patrick Gordon and Avtonom Golovin. Supplies were shipped down the Don from Voronezh.In 1693 the Ottoman garrison of the fortress was 3,656, of whom 2,272 were Janissaries.Between June 27-July 5 the Russians blocked Azov from land but could not control the river and prevent resupply. After two unsuccessful attacks on August 5 and September 25, the siege was lifted on October 1. Another Russian army  under the command of Boris Sheremetev set out for the lower reaches of the Dnieper to take the Ottoman forts there. The main fort at Gazi-Kerman was taken when its powder magazine blew up, as well as Islam-Kerman, Tagan and Tavan, but the Russians were not able to hold the area and withdrew most of their forces.

The heavy cruisers  and , and the light cruiser  were the first to be sent in July 1936. These large ships were accompanied by the 2nd Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The German presence was used to covertly support Francisco Franco Spanish State although the immediate involvement of the Deutschland was humanitarian relief operations and evacuating 9,300 refugees, including 4,550 German citizens.

"The game started out with the teams trading punts, and when Houston attempted a punt from the Jets' 37-yard line, punter Chad Stanley fumbled the snap and the Jets had the ball at their own 46-yard line. A 36-yard completion from Chad Pennington to Laveranues Coles almost went for naught when Leon Washington fumbled a short pass, but Brad Smith recovered. Mike Nugent booted a 23-yard field goal to put the Jets on the board. On the Jets' next drive, Pennington led the Jets into Houston territory, aided by a pass-interference call on DeMarcus Faggins. Nugent kicked a 34-yard field goal for a 6-0 Jets lead. Houston rebounded, with David Carr converting a key third down to Andre Johnson to set up Kris Brown's 47-yard field goal. Pennington completed a long pass to Jerricho Cotchery on the next drive to set up Nugent's career-long 54-yard field goal to give the Jets a 9-3 lead. The half ended when Brown came up five yards short on a 59-yard field goal attempt. On the Jets' first possession of the second half, following a Houston punt, Pennington completed long passes to Chris Baker and Cotchery before finding Coles on a 12-yard touchdown pass. On the Jets' next drive, fans everywhere held their breath when Pennington was drilled by Mario Williams while releasing a pass and was slow to get up. Luckily, he only had the wind knocked out of him.

"The greatest single victory of the SNA-WSLF was a second assault on Jijiga in mid-September , in which the demoralized Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town. The local defenders were no match for the assaulting Somalis and the Ethiopian military was forced to withdraw past the strategic strongpoint of the Marda Pass, halfway between Jijiga and Harar. By September Ethiopia was forced to admit that it controlled only about 10% of the Ogaden and that the Ethiopian defenders had been pushed back into the non-Somali areas of Harerge, Bale, and Sidamo. However, the Somalis were unable to press their advantage because of the high attrition on its tank battalions, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, and the onset of the rainy season which made the dirt roads unusable. During that time, the Ethiopian government managed to raise and train a giant militia force 100,000 strong and integrated it into the regular fighting force. Also, since the Ethiopian army was a client of U.S weapons, hasty acclimatization to the new Warsaw Pact bloc weaponry took place. From October 1977 until January 1978, the SNA-WSLF forces attempted to capture Harar during the Battle of Harar, where 40,000 Ethiopians had regrouped and re-armed with Soviet-supplied artillery and armor; backed by 1500 Soviet ""advisors"" and 11,000 Cuban soldiers, they engaged the attackers in vicious fighting. Though the Somali forces reached the city outskirts by November, they were too exhausted to take the city and eventually had to withdraw to await the Ethiopian counterattack.",2a69bcb13e9953463be9dd858dd42381,Did SNA-WSLF forces have more Cuban soldiers or more Ethiopian soldiers when they took part in the Battle of Harar?,Ethiopian soldiers,Cuban soldiers,naqanet,ccfcbbeadd1385d5823e79014eec1f5d,How many men in all were on teh Ethiopian side during the Battle of Harar?,52500,41500.0,nabert,f963e882850d096a2904fa7d8e1597c6,How many were on the Ethiopian side at the Battle of Harar?,40000,41500,naqanet,adcd206a316796ab56cbb886192d5219,How many were on the Ethiopian side at the Battle of Harar?,40000,51000.0,nabert,3855408dc003cc9f6caa413bfacc752c,The Battle of Harar took place in what interval?,October 1977 until January 1978,SNA-WSLF,naqanet,86ab5e5552a58276ed74e9318cb37ea3,The Battle of Harar took place in what interval?,October 1977 until January 1978,october,nabert,7bafaef1da36957fe0df409337eedfd7,"Which had the largest group, Ethiopians,  Cuban soldiers or Soviet advisors?",Ethiopians,"Ethiopians,  Cuban soldiers",naqanet,81cf2cdb422c17efeac67d4b0a75498f,"Which had the largest group, Ethiopians,  Cuban soldiers or Soviet advisors?",Ethiopians,"soviet "" advisors",nabert,df441b8cac12d94db05f1150d806c39c,"Which was an issue that the Somalis faced when trying to press their advantage over the Ethiopians, the withdraw of the Marda Pass, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, or demoralized troops?",constant Ethiopian air attacks,"withdraw of the Marda Pass, constant Ethiopian air attacks",naqanet,7f0f4ba72b51961f8a1fdf1b167c7929,Who attacked the Ethiopians?,Somalis,"Soviet ""advisors",naqanet,875a8da2c1482d0504e794501a95034b,Who attacked the Ethiopians?,Somalis,cuban soldiers,nabert,99fe69f62d1ba98821aee897f1b64af6,Who had to withdraw from Harar?,Somali forces,WSLF forces,naqanet,858db0c464fe859b528467a10ba33be9,Who had to withdraw from Harar?,Somali forces,ethiopian troops,nabert,2c624e4c912c321f7e248f8d262db960,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The institutional framework of Navarre was preserved following the 1512 invasion. Once Ferdinand II of Aragon died in January, the Parliament of Navarre gathered in Pamplona, urging Charles V  to attend a coronation ceremony in the town following tradition, but the envoys of the Parliament were met with the Emperor's utter indifference if not contempt. He refused to attend any ceremony and responded with a brief ""let's say I am happy and  pleases me."" Eventually the Parliament met in 1517 without Charles V, represented instead by the Duke of Najera pronouncing an array of promises of little certitude, while the acting Parliament kept piling up grievances and demands for damages due to the Emperor, totalling 67—the 2nd Viceroy of Navarre Fadrique de Acuña was deposed in 1515 probably for acceding to send grievances.:39-40 Contradictions inherent to the documents accounting for the Emperor's non-existent oath pledge in 1516 point to a contemporary manipulation of the records.",efd6f556a4a22b34e2569bb371107e75,Where was the coronation that Charles V was supposed to attend?,Pamplona,"pamplona , urging charles v to attend a coronation ceremony in the town",nabert,8954a64828204885e7d9dc9d8c6c524b,Who refused to attend the ceremony?,Charles V,Parliament of Navarre,naqanet,4ef70298a8d4a5b5562c8041e558ea92,Who represented the Emperor at Parliament?,Duke of Najera,Charles V,naqanet,e4157a8fb78e0496713d9a0abcd16157,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The irony of a Cardinal attacking the troops of a Pope was not lost on Rome, Spain, and ultra-Catholics in France. In 1625 the French marshals François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières and Charles de Blanchefort, Marquis de Créquy, joined the Duke of Savoy, invaded the territories of the dominion of Genoa. An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker. The time seemed opportune, with the apparent convergence of Protestant hostility to the Habsburgs, and explains French participation in the London talks with Mansfeld. Richelieu hoped Britain and the Dutch would send a fleet to assist his own squadron in cutting the seaway between Spain and Genoa, while Venice attacked Milan. François Annibal d'Estrées, Duke of Estrées and 3,500 French troops crossed Protestant Swiss territory to join a similar number of Rhetians levied with French money. More subsidies and troops poured into Savoy, where the French formed a third of the 30,000-strong army that began operations against Genoa in February 1625. The attack caught the Genoese Republic unprepared. Most of the Republic was overrun, while 4,000 reinforcements from Spain were intercepted by French warships in March.

"The monetary unit is the dinar, at about 1.33 per dollar U.S.A. (recently a fairly constant rate), with inflation estimated pp. 4.5% for 2006. Tunisias per capita annual income was approximately 8,900 dollars (U.S.A.) in 2006. Between 1988 and 1998 the economy more than doubled. The economy grew at 5% per year during the 1990s (the best in Northwest Africa), but hit a 15-year low of 1.9% in 2002 (due to drought and a decline in tourism), but it regained a 5% rate for 2003–2005; it was said to be 4%–5% for 2006.  Tunisias economy is diverse. Its products are primarily from light industry (food processing, textiles, footwear, agribusiness, mining commodities, construction materials) and from agriculture (olives, olive oil, grains (wheat and barley), tomatoes, citrus, sugar beets, dates, almonds, figs, vegetables, grapes, beef dairy), as well as livestock (sheep, goats) and fishing. Other production comes from petroleum and mining (phosphates, iron, oil, lead, zinc, salt). Tunisia is self-sufficient in oil, but not in natural gas. A very significant portion of the economy derives from the tourist industry. Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) was composed of approximately 12.5% agriculture, 33.1% industry, and 54.4% services. Exports went to France 29%, Italy 20%, Germany 9%, Spain 6%, Libya 5%, U.S.A. 4%. Imports came from France 25%, Italy 22%, Germany 10%, Spain 5%.

"The next three years (1962-64) featured Joe Namath at quarterback and were among Bryants finest.  The 1962 college football season season ended with a 17-0 victory in the 1963 Orange Bowl over Bud Wilkinsons Oklahoma Sooners football. The following year ended with a 12-7 victory over Ole Miss in the 1964 Sugar Bowl, which was the first game between the two Southeastern Conference neighbors in almost twenty years, and only the second in thirty years. In 1964 college football season, 1964 Alabama Crimson Tide football team won another national championship, but lost 21-17 to 1964 Texas Longhorns football team in the 1965 Orange Bowl, in the first nationally televised college game in color. The Tide ended up sharing the 1964 national title with Arkansas, since the Razorbacks won the 1965 Cotton Bowl, and had previously beaten Texas in Austin. Prior to 1968, the AP and UPI polls gave out their championships before the bowl games. The AP ceased this practice before the ""68 season, but the UPI continued until 1973. The Crimson Tide would repeat as champions in 1965 college football season after defeating Nebraska 39-28 in the 1966 Orange Bowl. Coming off back-to-back national championship seasons, Bryants Alabama team went undefeated in 1966 college football season, and defeated a strong Nebraska team 34-7 in the 1967 Sugar Bowl. However, Alabama finished third in the nation behind national co-champions 1966 Michigan State Spartans football team and 1966 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team, who had previously 1966 Notre Dame vs. Michigan State football game in a late regular season game. In a biography of Bryant written by Allen Barra, the author suggests that the major polling services refused to elect Alabama as National Champion for a third straight year because of George Wallaces recent stands against integration",7f9eb7ca7cade2f12f2647726882a698,How many years featured Joe Namath at quarterback in 1962-1964?,2,3,nabert,427c6fa22073fc23687b04c4ff72a7a3,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The next year, Pettitte tied for first in games started (35), and also led the league in pickoffs (14), and double plays induced (36). He was third in the league in innings pitched (IP) (; a career high), fourth in ERA (2.88), wins (18), and winning percentage (.720), sixth in complete games (4), eighth in strikeouts (166), and tenth in walks per nine innings (2.43). Alongside teammate David Cone, it would be the last time a Yankee starter finished with a sub 3.00 ERA until Luis Severino finished with a 2.98 ERA in 2017. Pettitte finished fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting. In 1998, he was seventh in the league in complete games (5; a career high), and eighth in wins (16). In the 1998 ALCS, Pettitte allowed four home runs in a game to the Cleveland Indians. The Yankees won the series, and defeated the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series.

"The poll tax was resurrected during the 17th century, usually related to a military emergency. It was imposed by Charles I of England in 1641 to finance the raising of the army against the Scottish and Irish uprisings. With the Restoration (England) of Charles II of England in 1660, the Convention Parliament (1660) instituted a poll tax to finance the disbanding of the New Model Army (pay arrears, etc.) (12 Charles II c.9). The poll tax was assessed according to ""rank"", e.g. dukes paid £100, earls £60, knights £20, esquires £10. Eldest sons paid 2/3rds of their fathers rank, widows paid a third of their late husbands rank. The members of the livery companies paid according to companys rank (e.g. masters of first-tier guilds like the Mercers paid £10, whereas masters of fifth-tier guilds, like the Clerks, paid 5 shillings). Professionals also paid differing rates, e.g. physicians (£10), judges (£20), advocates (£5), attorneys (£3), and so on. Anyone with property (land, etc.) paid 40 shillings per £100 earned, anyone over the age of 16 and unmarried paid 12-pence and everyone else over 16 paid 6-pence.",afec3bca090bec861a76e58c7d4f1057,How many more pence did those who were over 16 and unmarried pay for poll tax than anyone else over 16?,6,4,naqanet,b4832eab4b6e222bfd4f9ca432de6b6f,How many more pounds did a duke pay to vote than a knight?,80,40,naqanet,6b4c2313e95996fe964b0fbc0c37ba9f,What professionals paid higher rates than the advocates?,physicians judges,judges,naqanet,1482238df6619b4d04580fdfa82140b8,Who paid the highest amount in the livery companies according to rank: mercers or clerks?,mercers,clerks,naqanet,4eb732eb921cf6ef54de87c37f84eb26,Who paid the highest poll taxes; earls or knights?,earls,earls or knights,naqanet,33e8174a8cb523498301bdffbd55e72e,Who paid the least amount of a relatives rank; eldest sons or widows?,eldest son,"eldest sons paid 2 / 3rds of their fathers rank , widows",nabert,9049a7fe59b1fabe4bde08a07070ced5,Who paid the least amount of a relatives rank; eldest sons or widows?,eldest son,widows,naqanet,97d39fe4334730ff09c537e626b2bb97,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The popular uprising included large areas of Lower Bavaria, the Innviertel and eastern Bavaria. The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side. That led to the collapse of the uprising against Austria.",8c687d753bcf92edce8a8eec7422828a,How many days after the Braunau Parliament did Sendling's Night of Murder occur?,4,-4.0,nabert,626fe6322ac7a95924e29be500ea374e,How many days after the Braunau Parliament did Sendling's Night of Murder occur?,4,46,naqanet,c05877924ced7944d1eb10d31a4d5b3a,How many days after the Braunau Parliament meeting was the Sendling's Night of Murder?,4,-4.0,nabert,bf911677e5f0061e369aa92c281f4ad9,How many days passed between the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre and the Battle of Aidenbach?,14,0.0,nabert,87f05ab176156b9cc4ee5bc7e55726a1,How many days passed between the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre and the Battle of Aidenbach?,14,17,naqanet,b1dc56c31483fe96a129bb00643bd105,"How many deaths occurred for the Bavarian's two weeks after the Bavarian side had already lost 1,100 men?",4000,3960,naqanet,21eac508675facaeaed62e46f9ba0069,"How many deaths occurred for the Bavarian's two weeks after the Bavarian side had already lost 1,100 men?",4000,4040.0,nabert,ca0e26f5ab725c22eaa20a6d05033506,How many months after the initial uprising was the Braunau Parliament held?,1,2,naqanet,b30eb321aebd0394faa791a32ca637f9,How many months after the initial uprising was the Braunau Parliament held?,1,3,nabert,04d4c263a48d0b76c9693b398de8a398,How many more deaths occurred on the Bavarian side than on the Austrian side?,1060,-2900,naqanet,fdc916781f170c26b134f33b72bcbde6,How many more deaths occurred on the Bavarian side than on the Austrian side?,1060,3960.0,nabert,6470353aa61dd59b4700602845b66ce6,How many more men did the Bavarians lose at the Battle of Aidenbach than the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre?,2900,-2900,naqanet,7740357cd8ffc5985767a9bd5cd81474,How many more men did the Bavarians lose at the Battle of Aidenbach than the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre?,2900,3960.0,nabert,58be18b2caf74f6468fe4b75b6829641,On what holiday did Sendling's Night of Murder take place on?,Christmas Day,christmas,nabert,b3a91a6d99167e803e0ac1b5aa6204d3,On what holiday did Sendling's Night of Murder take place on?,Christmas Day,outside of Munich.

"The population in Italy may have been introduced from the zoo Faunistic Park Le Cornelle which has kept a free-flying group since the early 1980s, or possibly from Brittany, but this is unclear. The first pair was seen breeding in the nearby heronry at Oldenico, in Lame del Sesia Regional Park in Novara, NW Italy, in 1989. By 1998 there was a colony of 9 pairs and 48 birds here; by 2000 there were 24-26 pairs, and by 2003 there were 25-30 breeding pairs. A second colony appeared in 2004 at another nearby heronry at Casalbeltrame. These birds would mostly feed in the rice fields in the area, but would also migrate elsewhere during the summer, with the population at the roosts increasing in the winter. In 2008, the number of breeding ibis was estimated at 80-100 pairs, and at least 300 birds. That same year, 6 individuals, consisting of 3 pairs, were observed roosting at a heronry in Casaleggio Novara. By 2009 they were said to be one of the most characteristic animals of the rice-growing area of Novara and Vercellese. In 2010 the species was reported attempting to breed in the Po Delta, NE Italy. By 2014 reports of individuals and small flocks were recorded in various areas from the Po Valley down to Tuscany. Outside the Piedmont Region, cases of possible nesting are reported in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardy.

"The poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median household income. In 2007-2008, this was calculated to be £115 per week for single adults with no dependent children; £199 per week for couples with no dependent children; £195 per week for single adults with two dependent children under 14; and £279 per week for couples with two dependent children under 14. In 2007-2008, 13.5 million people, or 22% of the population, lived below this line. This is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four other EU members. In the same year, 4.0 million children, 31% of the total, lived in households below the poverty line, after housing costs were taken into account.

"The rebellion of the city of Danzig  was a revolt from December 1575 to December 1577 of the city against the outcome of the Polish-Lithuanian royal election, 1576. The Polish throne was contested by Stephen Báthory and the Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II. It began on 12 December 1575 when Emperor Maximillian was chosen as monarch by the Polish Senate, while the majority of the szlachta  had voted for Bathory. It ended on 16 December 1577. Maximilian's II death in fall of 1576 weakened Danzig's position and made the conflict less about the recognition of the ruler than about Danzig's privileges. With neither side being able to defeat the other militarily, a compromise was reached, with economic as well as religious privileges of the city being restored and recognized, in return for a large reparation and recognition of Bathory as the king.",b65eeb698fa0d38acb667123b22a6f9a,How many years did Maximillian II rule over Danzig?,1,2,naqanet,c7f9b39cb4cdebedfdf68c3ca764ca50,On what exact date did the Danzig rebellion begin?,December 12 1575,1575,nabert,2c5413657c237db3e502e8ec0c3ea695,On what exact date did the Danzig rebellion begin?,December 12 1575,1577,naqanet,399da597410a5b42e1a78abb14e9491c,What day did the rebellion of the city of Danzig finish?,December 16 1577,1577,naqanet,a42d6315c08729bebefb92b7975ecfa6,What day did the rebellion of the city of Danzig finish?,December 16 1577,december,nabert,730767fb1d3a66bc4ff0ae2a67ddbd5d,"What happened first, the end of the rebellion of the city of Danzig or Maximilian's II death?",Maximilian's II death,end of the rebellion,nabert,ab81a9c4cfb8e76502844d41799e9d8f,"What happened first, the end of the rebellion of the city of Danzig or Maximilian's II death?",Maximilian's II death,rebellion of the city of Danzig,naqanet,bb155750fe37baf88eeea9bc1c595015,Which person received the majority of the people's vote?,Stephen Báthory,szlachta,naqanet,5ce0b91dfaca201c68a681d78be64a54,Which two people contested the Polish throne in 1576?,Stephen Báthory Maximillian II,Stephen Báthory,naqanet,6f0e06a0479945e93a18dce261b32bb6,Which two people contested the Polish throne in 1576?,Stephen Báthory Maximillian II,stephen bathory,nabert,3a5ca64d12462a822b4f7fb582b067f2,Which two people were competing for the Polish throne?,Stephen Báthory Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II,Stephen Báthory,naqanet,e88e46c5aeadb17d790dccfc549788c1,Which two people were competing for the Polish throne?,Stephen Báthory Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II,stephen bathory,nabert,e3c5f8c8e324b4920eca2edef4778363,Which two privileges were restored to the city after Maximilian's death?,economic religious,Maximilian's II death,naqanet,beafaffcab03f6f98634633f06de473a,Which two privileges were restored to the city after Maximilian's death?,economic religious,religious,nabert,e10741ef8a60ff65b25ba354cadca525,Who ultimately was crowned king?,Bathory,Maximilian's II,naqanet,5c83685bcb008985a119506948ca61ee,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The reliance on Adobe for decoding Flash makes its use on the World Wide Web a concern—the completeness of its public specifications are debated, and no complete implementation of Flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse. Generally, public specifications are what makes a format re-implementable , and reusable codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator. Adobe's restrictions on the use of the SWF/FLV specifications were lifted in February 2009 . However, despite efforts of projects like Gnash, Swfdec and Lightspark, a complete free Flash player is yet to be seen, as of September 2011. For example, Gnash cannot use SWF v10 yet.

It looked like Pittsburgh regained the lead on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to tight end Jesse James. However, the play was overturned and the Steelers couldn't find the end zone.

"The revolt was led by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow. Previously, the Socialist Revolutionary Party had supported the continuation of the war by the Provisional Government after the February Revolution of 1917. The Bolshevik Party came to power in November 1917 through the simultaneous election in the soviets and an organized uprising supported by military mutiny. Several of the main reasons the population supported the Bolsheviks were to end the war and have a social revolution, exemplified by the slogan ""Peace, Land, Bread"". The Bolsheviks invited left SRs and Martov's Menshevik Internationalists to join the government. Left SRs split from the main SR party and joined the Bolshevik coalition government, supporting the Bolsheviks immediate enactment of the Socialist Revolutionary Party's land redistribution program. The Left SRs were given four Commissar positions and held high posts within the Cheka. The Left SRs still diverged with the Bolsheviks on the issue of the war and were dismayed that the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk gave up large amounts of territory. They left the Council of the People's Commissars in protest in March 1918.

"The revolt was led by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow. Previously, the Socialist Revolutionary Party had supported the continuation of the war by the Provisional Government after the February Revolution of 1917. The Bolshevik Party came to power in November 1917 through the simultaneous election in the soviets and an organized uprising supported by military mutiny. Several of the main reasons the population supported the Bolsheviks were to end the war and have a social revolution, exemplified by the slogan ""Peace, Land, Bread"". The Bolsheviks invited left SRs and Martov's Menshevik Internationalists to join the government. Left SRs split from the main SR party and joined the Bolshevik coalition government, supporting the Bolsheviks immediate enactment of the Socialist Revolutionary Party's land redistribution program. The Left SRs were given four Commissar positions and held high posts within the Cheka. The Left SRs still diverged with the Bolsheviks on the issue of the war and were dismayed that the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk gave up large amounts of territory. They left the Council of the People's Commissars in protest in March 1918. The Left SRs agreed with extrajudicial execution of political opponents to stop the counterrevolution but opposed having the government legally pronouncing death sentences, an unusual position that is best understood within the context of the group's terrorist past. The Left SRs strongly opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and opposed Trotsky's insistence that nobody was allowed to attack German troops in Ukraine.

"The smaller of the Egyptian ells measured , but the standard Babylonian ell, cast in stone on one of the statues of Gudea, was 49.5 cm (19.49 in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8 cm (20.67 and 20.79 in). The Books of Samuel portray the Temple as having a Phoenician architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which was used to measure the size of parts of ships. Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5 cm (19.49 or 20.67 in), but are fairly certain that it was one of these two figures. From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit — the finger-breadth (Etzba) — can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2 cm (0.83 or 0.87 in); Rav Avraham Chaim Naeh approximates at 2 cm (0.79 in); Talmudic scholar Chazon Ish at 2.38 cm (0.94 in). The mile (Mil) is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760 ft) — approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land mile of 5280 ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6 km).",4dc61f2046753dffa12f1dfbeea37ac9,"Which was larger, the Babylonian ell or the Egyptian ell?",Egyptian ell,the babylonian ell or the egyptian ell,nabert,71234ea7826e233bc4c5326ddd466c70,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"The unit was split into two regiments in December 1939, with Fegelein in charge of both. By March 1941 their strength was 3,500 men. In July 1941, they were assigned to the Pripyat swamps (punitive operation), tasked with rounding up and exterminating Jews and partisans. The two regiments were amalgamated into the SS Cavalry Brigade on 31 July, twelve days after the operation started. Fegeleins final report, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, and 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.

"The uprising greatly reduced the Tver Principality's power in the northeastern remains of Kievan Rus'. In 1328, Öz Beg granted Ivan Kalita the duchies of Novgorod and Kostroma. Alexander Vasilyevich, the prince of Suzdal, received Vladimir and a region encompassing present day Nizhny Novgorod and Gorodets. By granting the more prestigious Vladimir to the weaker of the two princes, Öz Beg maintained adherence to the principle of ""divide and rule,"" reasoning that Moscow's jealousy of Suzdal's lands would prevent them from allying to fight against the Golden Horde. Alexander moved to Sweden after his time in Lithuania, and then back to Pskov after the city's excommunication was lifted, under the patronage of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1335, he gained forgiveness from Öz Beg and was allowed to return to his former position in Tver, however by then, the state had lost most of its influence, being replaced by the Grand Duchy of Muscovy. This return did not last long, as both Alexander and his son Fyodor were taken to Sarai and quartered in 1339. Following the execution of Alexander Vasilievich in 1331, Ivan received the duchy of Vladimir and became the sole ruler of northeastern Russia. Favor from the khan of the Golden Horde allowed Moscow to gain power rapidly at the expense of Tver, with Tver eventually losing all influence to Moscow. However, a new rivalry was formed between the princes of Suzdal-Nizhny Novgorod. The relative power of Moscow and their strong alliance with the Horde led to a period of relative peace in Russia that was not interrupted until the reign of Dmitry Donskoy, the first prince of Moscow to openly challenge the Horde. He would later defeat them at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380.",93bacadcd0ee9545593134e67c5e83d6,How many years after Alexander Vasilievich received Vladimir and a region encompassing present day Nizhny Novgorod and Gorodets was he executed?,3,8.0,nabert,92951a3d61966a86315d6ac5dd45c9c4,How many years after Alexander gained forgiveness from Öz Beg was he taken to Sarai and quartererd?,4,7,naqanet,35fb735f6bc5c46c4ed701183deb82b7,How many years was Alexander allowed to return to his former position in Tver?,4,-1335,naqanet,8300223b2b5f84fed123c01c3864e075,How was Alexander killed?,quartered,execution,nabert,6eb55a9ebd023f3a67a98fb4c6486462,How was Alexander killed?,quartered,his son,naqanet,2f48c8620341a6270cb35c2c54888489,"Who was a prince first, Dmitry Donskoy or Alexander Vasilyevich?",Alexander Vasilyevich,Dmitry Donskoy,naqanet,621b274f78da3b2bc04447ce0fab3682,Who was before Ivan?,Alexander,oz beg,nabert,8d6262f53edb51f86bbee700b2d7b7db,Who was before Ivan?,Alexander,Öz Beg,naqanet,c6aff9b2935186e71f57460187939a27,Who was killed in Sarai?,Alexander and his son Fyodor,Fyodor,naqanet,38f8c116b380b6888e6d784e62495be9,Who was not allied with the Golden Horde?,Öz Beg,moscow,nabert,f6c195ab1625b0ff02508ed142f20a92,Why was Alexander Vasiliveich taken to Sarai?,execution,fyodor were taken to sarai and quartered,nabert,95541097927d62a9d162bc3e0a919176,Why was Alexander Vasiliveich taken to Sarai?,execution,his son,naqanet,3d7c7e33922e2b34518f9d42bb8b26b3,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The war is known by several names. ""Polish-Soviet War"" is the most common but other names include ""Russo-Polish War  of 1919-1921""  and ""Polish-Bolshevik War"". This second term ) is most common in Polish sources. In some Polish sources it is also referred as the ""War of 1920"" . There is disagreement over the dates of the war. The Encyclopædia Britannica begins its article with the date range 1919-1920 but then states, ""Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state Józef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura  and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May."" The Polish Internetowa encyklopedia PWN, as well as Western historians such as Norman Davies, consider 1919 the starting year of the war. The ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the ceasefire was put in force in the autumn of 1920, the official treaty ending the war was signed months later, in March 1921. While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier. In the end, the events of 1920 were a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude.",67249f614110b07c665020c8d5538152,How many years was the Polish-Soviet War?,2,3,nabert,a3990981fe670a1abb9221444ff3effc,What is the most common name for the Polish-Bolshevik War?,Polish-Soviet War,Russo,naqanet,f49dd21f464126cd906882d203134723,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Then, in 1544, five French galleys under Polin, including the superb Réale, accompanied Barbarossa's fleet, on a diplomatic mission to Suleiman. The French fleet accompanied Barbarossa during his attacks on the west coast of Italy on the way to Constantinople, as he laid waste to the cities of Porto Ercole, Giglio, Talamona, Lipari and took about 6,000 captives, but separated in Sicily from Barbarossa's fleet to continue alone to the Ottoman capital. Jerôme Maurand, a priest of Antibes who accompanied Polin and the Ottoman fleet in 1544, wrote a detailed account in Itinéraire d'Antibes à Constantinople.

"This article is about the demographic features of the population of Lebanon, including population density, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. About 99% of the population of Lebanon includes numerous Muslim sects and Christian denominations. Because the matter of religious balance is a sensitive political issue, a national census has not been conducted since 1932, before the founding of the modern Lebanese state. Consequently, there is an absence of accurate data on the relative percentages of the population of the major religions and groups. The absence of data and comprehensive statistics concerns also concerns all other demographic studies unrelated to religious balance, due to the all but total inactivity of the concerned public agencies. The only recent  statistics available are estimates based on studies made by private organizations. There are from 8.6 to 14 million Lebanese and descendants of Lebanese worldwide.

"This game involved a scary moment, after Seattle's  Ricardo Lockette was hit during a kick return. He lied on the ground, motionless, for about 7 minutes before he was taken off the field on a cart. X-rays later revealed that Lockette had a broken neck. The injury ended his career. The Cowboys would only kick field goals in this game, as Dan Bailey was 4 for 4 on field goals. Dallas lead 12-10 with under 2 minutes to go. However, the Seahawks would march down the field and would take a 13-12 lead after Steven Hauschka drilled a 24-yard field goal.

"This would be the first meeting between quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Andrew Luck, who were both selected in the 2012 NFL Draft. Though Wilson and the Seahawks maintained a lead throughout the first three quarters, Luck led the Colts back, taking the lead and never letting go in the 4th. It would be the first loss for the Seahawks in the season, dropping their record to 4-1. The Colts punted and the Seahawks drove down the field and scored a field goal to go up 3-0. After another Indy three-and-out, Russell Wilson threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate to take a 10-0 lead. Then another Indy punt was blocked and bounced out of the endzone to extend the lead to 12-0. Seattle punted to Indy when Andrew Luck threw a 73-yard touchdown to T.Y. Hilton to make the score 12-7. Seattle drove into field goal range but a 48-yard field goal was blocked and returned for a touchdown by the Colts. Indy led 14-12 until Wilson found Jermaine Kearse to give Seattle a 19-14 lead. Luck led the Colts downfield and they kicked a field goal to make it 19-17 at the half. Seattle kicked another field goal to make it 22-17. Indianapolis fumbled and led to a 25-17 Seahawks lead. Luck then found Hilton in the endzone but the two-point-conversion failed leaving  the score at 25-23. Seattle then kicked a 4th field goal to extend their lead to 28-23.

"Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.",327a0d672f1d5e39661342d161972259,"Before discontent of the Russian public set in due to the Japanese forces multiple failures, what event had actually rallied popular support for the war in the Russian public?",Japanese attack at Port Arthur,1905,nabert,ec7e30739978d401849364590cb05e1a,"Before discontent of the Russian public set in due to the Japanese forces multiple failures, what event had actually rallied popular support for the war in the Russian public?",Japanese attack at Port Arthur,Port Arthur,naqanet,1779a6a144bd50ffc1bf2415957827e4,What did not address the societal problems of Russian?,the October Manifesto,limited reforms,naqanet,c3e91bf0cc46590906023418eb898d1b,"Which Russian army was smaller, the one that was sent to put down the unrest or the one that was facing the Japanese?",the one facing the Japanese,japanese,nabert,f1ac7c6e689a3c3c7e85d987da1971f5,"Which Russian army was smaller, the one that was sent to put down the unrest or the one that was facing the Japanese?",the one facing the Japanese,unrest,naqanet,69d8ae5d87a3e55d736a5a50365bb313,"Which army had the least soldiers, Russian or Japanese?",Japanese,russian,nabert,0be4dfc3a41104e78dee86ab7d7846ff,Which revolution was the one that occurred before the February Revolution of 1917?,Russian Revolution of 1905,october,nabert,92b23ed1ca6094f58e89c6fae3d431a4,how fid the russians feel after the loss to the japanese?,unexpected humiliation,12.0,nabert,a138d6e1480b25fe70cc32cdc8932b44,how fid the russians feel after the loss to the japanese?,unexpected humiliation,"250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest",naqanet,3a4d476257df17328d49d6859ae7a200,the Japanese attack at Port Arthur was how many years before the Russian Revolution of 1905?,1,1918,naqanet,76c7404a64b66543d3667fe349703b7b,what did Nicolas II want to avoid entirely?,Russian Revolution of 1905,taking intransigent negotiating stances,naqanet,4b2c6921dc61d81779d4efff630fd40f,what did the political leaders of the Polish insurrection send to Japan,emissaries,Russian Empire,naqanet,799f9c4dcaec5a04ddcdad0e3fc95ef0,what was one reason that the emissaries sent to japan,intelligence gathering,collaborate on sabotage,naqanet,1fcce7f45cf1e15aed2e9b3abce585da,what was one reason that the emissaries sent to japan,intelligence gathering,sabotage and intelligence gathering within the russian empire and even plan a japanese - aided uprising,nabert,7056f0e050f5ac542e2662fd439cf75c,what was the main issue with there being Russian rule with Poland,two major uprisings,caused two major uprisings,naqanet,089dc376f09a556ff35dd383bae1e970,what was this seen as for the Romanov autocracy,a metaphor for the shortcomings,a metaphor,naqanet,a401835183797e28c1f4ccc76436ef48,what was this seen as for the Romanov autocracy,a metaphor for the shortcomings,conflict,nabert,69f25d73e7095f54fb84211457015cde,"with the defeat in 1905, what did this cause in the Russian military?",a reform,Japanese-aided uprising,naqanet,3c67d5d7461c9a8e39014eb4e9876320,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Tottenham Hotspur F.C. became a limited company, The Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd, on 2 March 1898 so as to raise funds for the club and limit the personal liability of its members. 8,000 shares were issued at £1 each, although only 1,558 shares were taken up in the first year. Members of the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s and were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in the 1960s and 1970s, were once the largest shareholder of the club. In the early 1980s, cost overruns in the construction of a new West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to financial difficulties for the club.

"Trunajaya rebellion  or Trunajaya War was the ultimately unsuccessful rebellion waged by the Madurese prince Trunajaya and fighters from Makassar against the Mataram Sultanate and its Dutch East India Company  supporters in Java  during the 1670s. The rebellion was initially successful: the rebels defeated the royal army at Gegodog , captured most of the Javanese north coast, and took the Mataram capital Plered . King Amangkurat I died during the retreat of the royal court. His son and successor, Amangkurat II, requested help from the VOC in exchange for financial remuneration and geopolitical concessions. The VOC's subsequent involvement turned the tide of the war. VOC and Mataram forces recovered lost territories and overran Trunajaya's new capital at Kediri . However, the rebellion continued until the capture of Trunajaya at the end of 1679, and the defeat, death, or surrender of the other rebel leaders . Trunajaya was killed by Amangkurat II personally in 1680 while a prisoner of the VOC. After his father's death in 1677, Amangkurat II also faced rival claims to the throne. The most serious rival was his brother Pangeran Puger, who took the capital Plered in 1677 and did not surrender until 1681.",e0b045fa3c5f1c64861ed401890b6bbf,How many years was it between Trunajaya's capture and his death while prisoner of the VOC?,1,-3,naqanet,696e3ccbe321e5618fd508eb51116b2e,What was captured last: Plered or Trunajaya?,Trunajaya,plered,nabert,f1be8ffad6a89defbfdb50188dad4df7,Who was Amangkurat II's father?,Amangkurat I,Pangeran Puger,naqanet,cc7ed282107742a3d4479cc4c630331e,Who was Amangkurat II's father?,Amangkurat I,king amangkurat i,nabert,eb74b890903ac4b0ca565e1283a12877,Who was Pangeran Puger's father?,King Amangkurat I,Amangkurat II,naqanet,9ac1fd1f0bfc6b9fd27537a7af21f2a5,Who was born first: Amangkurat I or Amangkurat II?,Amangkurat I,Amangkurat I or Amangkurat II,naqanet,ef0e6f3dbec8c0d8d082c12908afad0e,Who were King Amangkurat I two sons?,Amangkurat II Pangeran Puger,Amangkurat II,naqanet,78095a5261f48d4b9c40a861e8f6e765,Who were King Amangkurat I two sons?,Amangkurat II Pangeran Puger,ii,nabert,220fae52863b73621bb37882ab57fbdf,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Trying to rebound from their home loss to the Texans, the Panther flew to the Georgia Dome for an NFC South duel with the Atlanta Falcons. After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina scored first in the second quarter with kicker John Kasay hitting a 45-yard field goal. The Falcons took the lead with QB Joey Harrington completing a 69-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. The Panthers followed up with QB Jake Delhomme completing a 13-yard TD pass to RB DeShaun Foster. Atlanta would end the half with kicker Morten Andersen hitting a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Falcons took the lead as Harrington completed a 13-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler. Carolina retook the lead with Delhomme completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King, followed by a 10-yard TD run from Foster. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers scored again, with Kasay kicking a 49-yard field goal. The Falcons' Andersen nailed a 25-yard field goal to end the scoring. The game was noteworthy because of DeAngelo Hall's third quarter meltdown, wherein he was assessed 67 yards of penalties in a single drive. The penalties included a 37-yard pass interference penalty for tackling WR Steve Smith before the ball arrived, a 15-yard personal foul on the following play for blocking Smith at the line, and a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty during a verbal exchange with Smith following a third-down sack by John Abraham. The unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave Carolina a first down, allowing their eventual TD to King rather than the likely 45-yard field goal attempt had the penalty not been called. Following the series, Hall was seen arguing with coaches on the sidelines, leading to a $100,000 fine by the team.",80b5853ba4d4b473db43e2383bc10a78,How many touchdowns did Foster have?,2,1,naqanet,595a71a8131cd8343802a3390edff336,How many yards did Andersen hit?,49,24,naqanet,5c5582ce4dfc073cc6f3db61133199d8,Which yard line did both teams score a touchdown from?,13,13 - yard,nabert,a242354ea0273a73b1b30ddb8284671c,Which yard line did both teams score a touchdown from?,13,5-yard,naqanet,24098fbc0894aaccb77441c490a7b114,Who caught at least two touchdown passes?,Jeff King,roddy white,nabert,6b8679f3c7d71ff5621314ad7ceb4e6b,how many yards did Kasay kick?,94,49,naqanet,cf1c7214f4672832e33da53bc03d9ab9,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Trying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Lions returned home for an NFC North rematch the-now 2-time NFC North champion Chicago Bears.  In the first quarter, the Bears struck first with kicker Robbie Gould nailing a 36-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Lions took the lead with QB Jon Kitna completing a 23-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell.  In the second quarter, Chicago bounced back with QB Rex Grossman completing a 13-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian.  Afterwards, RB Adrian Peterson got a 2-yard TD run.

"Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.  They would wear their alternate uniforms as they played against the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 31-yard field goal, while QB Tom Brady completed a 1-yard TD pass to LB Mike Vrabel.  In the second quarter, the Bengals managed to get on the board with QB Carson Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  However, New England would respond with Brady completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. Near the end of the 2nd quarter, the Bengals had a chance to get closer to the Pats, but a miscommunication between Palmer and Chad Johnson resulted in a New England interception. Palmer and Johnson argued on the sidelines and all the way back to the locker room. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as Patriots RB Sammy Morris getting a 7-yard TD run.  The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal.  Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. With their third-straight loss, the Bengals entered their bye week at 1-3.  It also marked Cincinnati's 5th loss to New England in the last 6 meetings.

"Tunis, the capital, has a population of about 700,000, and the second city of Sfax approximately 250,000. The population growth rate measured as births per female has fallen from 7 (1960s) to 2 (2007). Life expectancy is female 75, male 72. The religion is Islam (98%), with 1% Christian, and 1% Jewish and other. Required education is eight years. The official language is Arabic language, with French language also spoken particularly in commercial dealings, and with less than 2% Berber languages. Literacy by definition includes all over 15 years, and is overall 74%, male 83% and female 65%. In 2006, 7.3 million mobile phones were in use and 1.3 million were on the internet; there were 26 television stations and 29 radio stations.  Over half the population is considered urban, with agricultural workers being about 30% of the total. Unemployment in 2000 was about 15.6%, and in 2006 about 13.9%.

"Under a much broader definition (including people that have given up searching for employment) two different studies determined the unemployment rate to be 36.7% (2004) and 51.2% (2008), respectively. This estimate considers people in the Informal sector as employed. 72% of jobless people have been unemployed for two years or more. Labour and Social Welfare Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko praised the 2008 study as ""by far superior in scope and quality to any that has been available previously"", but its methodology has also received criticism.

"Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758, as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping. The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle; yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing ""bad medicine"" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry. Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years. The British failures in North America combined with other failures in the European theater and led to Newcastle's fall from power along with the Duke of Cumberland, his principal military advisor. Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning. He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun. He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757. Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France.

"Wearing bright orange uniforms and showing their speed on defense and special teams, the Chicago Bears overwhelmed the 49ers who were coming off their Bye Week. They jumped to a 24-0 first-quarter lead and 41-0 halftime cushion before coasting to a 41-10 victory. Brian Urlacher's one-handed interception was headed to the highlight reel as soon as he tumbled to the ground after somehow batting the ball to himself. Urlacher's stellar play symbolized what kind of afternoon it was for the refreshed and still unbeaten Chicago Bears - and how frustrating the day was for the San Francisco 49ers. San Francisco entered giving up 32 points a game, but the defense wasn't to fault early on because turnovers allowed the Bears to work from short fields. Drives started at the 15, 41 and 13, and they turned all three into touchdowns to take the big opening-quarter lead. The 49ers coughed up the ball a fourth time late in the half when WR Antonio Bryant caught a pass and fumbled, with CB Ricky Manning Jr. recovering. San Francisco averted a shutout in the fourth quarter on a 23-yard field goal by K Joe Nedney and a 16-yard TD pass from Smith to WR Antonio Bryant. QB Alex Smith finished 16 of 26 for 146 yards. RB Frank Gore rushed for 111 yards on 12 carries, thanks to a 53-yard run.

But in June of that year, he put down a Loyalist uprising on the banks of the Pee Dee River. In August he left his brigade and returned to his plantation. In 1782, the British Parliament suspended offensive operations in America, and in December 1782, the British withdrew their garrison from Charleston.

"When Matthias Corvinus died from a stroke on 6 April 1490, Frederick was able to regain the Austrian lands. However, he could not enforce the Habsburg succession to the Hungarian throne and in 1491 his son King Maximilian I signed the Peace of Pressburg with Vladislaus Jagiellon, who was elected Matthias' successor in Hungary. The treaty arranged for the return of Matthias' conquests, and the agreement that Maximilian would succeed Vladislaus should he produce no heir. This did not happen as Vladislaus' son Louis II was born in 1506, but the Habsburgs did exert significant pressure on the Jagiellonians with the 1515 First Congress of Vienna in which they arranged two royal weddings of Vladislaus' daughter Anne with Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand and of Maximilian's granddaughter Mary with Louis II. The double wedding celebrated at St. Stephen's Cathedral decisively advanced the Habsburg succession agenda. During his reign in Hungary, the new Polish king would go on to undo many of Matthias' efforts, unmaking the reformed system of taxation, the standing army, and the centralized authority of the monarch. Hungary's nobles would act in complicity with this, contributing to the weakening of the country until 1526, when Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács, whereby King Louis II was killed. The Habsburg archduke Ferdinand of Austria by his marriage with Anne of Bohemia and Hungary claimed the succession, he was enfoffed with the Bohemian kingdom by his elder brother Emperor Charles V and also reached the consent of the Hungarian magnates. He was crowned king in Pressburg  on 24 February 1527, laying the grounds for the transnational Habsburg Monarchy.",4941a773b8250a3a8013e84c74a03621,How many years old was Louis II when he died?,20,16,naqanet,519b52746abfa78d535bfa4e94808408,How many years passed between Matthias Corvinus's death and the death of King Louis II?,36,16,naqanet,8835111e00812eba9702380c5a855a09,"What happened first, the death of Matthias Corvinus or the signing of the Peace of Pressburg?",the death of Matthias Corvinus,died,naqanet,bf99fdf53b2cd006ba6561c78dc31218,What was Ferdinand of Austria's relation to Emperor Charles V?,brother,Habsburg,naqanet,af263aed4908086d02bf9b5eaa9ea916,What was Ferdinand of Austria's relation to Emperor Charles V?,brother,anne of bohemia,nabert,22f2133782bac4930305d4aa04237a2c,Who became the king of Hungary following Louis II's death?,Ferdinand of Austria,Matthias Corvinus,naqanet,14224db9bd3432f3d7e532ca8d2f7f7d,Who became the king of Hungary following Louis II's death?,Ferdinand of Austria,king maximilian i,nabert,927d2a4fb999970c3bd12211b72b7559,Who held the Hungarian throne after Vladislaus Jagiellon?,Louis II,King Maximilian I,naqanet,3fea40c9c3ce05c64b6cb9e32fcda860,Who held the Hungarian throne following Matthias Corvinus' death?,Vladislaus Jagiellon,King Maximilian I,naqanet,3761a90218fcd987ca70b6f511fb544c,Who held the Hungarian throne following Matthias Corvinus' death?,Vladislaus Jagiellon,king maximilian i signed the peace of pressburg with vladislaus jagiellon,nabert,032541bf9c77f700dc1cc6550b3ebc14,Who is the father of King Maximilian I?,Matthias Corvinus his son King Maximilian I,Vladislaus Jagiellon,naqanet,897104421fdc7da4f95a5ca370a10993,Who is the father of King Maximilian I?,Matthias Corvinus his son King Maximilian I,matthias corvinus,nabert,d9025b7f6b19afcca7078cb9a37739e1,Who was King Maximilian I's father?,Frederick,Vladislaus Jagiellon,naqanet,c9f85b160a2ab2395986c7e3a82337c9,Who was Maximilian's father?,Frederick,Louis II,naqanet,bc48c92ecf25fbafe896db43afadeb86,Who was Maximilian's father?,Frederick,king maximilian i,nabert,47449cd1cc6c00262f5001c6e09ba83e,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"When the railroad was extended through Madison in 1875, larger mills were built. The first Madison Woolen Mill was constructed in 1881 near the bridge between Madison and Anson, with the firm's second mill built nearby in 1887. In 1890, the Manufacturing Investment Company built a sulfite mill, but it failed. It was taken over in 1899 by the Great Northern Paper Company, which rebuilt the plant to produce wood pulp and paper. Like many New England textile manufacturers, the town's woolen mills eventually went out of business, but the pulp and paper mill remains today as the Madison Paper Industries which will close by May 2016 due to low demand for supercalender paper and Canadian competition. In 1901, Lakewood Summer Theatre opened in East Madison on the western side of Lake Wesserunsett. Since 1967 it has been the official summer theatre of Maine, and the oldest continually operating summer theatre in America.

"While KSCB was abandoned, the Marines continued to patrol the Khe Sanh plateau, including reoccupying the area with ARVN forces from 5-19 October 1968 with minimal opposition. On 31 December 1968, the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion was landed west of Khe Sanh to commence Operation Dawson River West, on 2 January 1969 the 9th Marines and 2nd ARVN Regiment were also deployed on the plateau supported by the newly established Fire Support Bases Geiger and Smith; the 3-week operation found no significant PAVN forces or supplies in the Khe Sanh area. From 12 June to 6 July 1969, Task Force Guadalcanal comprising 1/9 Marines, 5th Infantry Regiment (United States) and 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 2nd ARVN Regiment occupied the Khe Sanh area in Operation Utah Mesa. The Marines occupied Hill 950 overlooking the Khe Sanh plateau from 1966 until September 1969 when control was handed to the Army who used the position as a SOG operations and support base until it was overrun by the PAVN in June 1971. The gradual withdrawal of US forces began during 1969 and the adoption of Vietnamization meant that, by 1969, ""although limited tactical offensives abounded, US military participation in the war would soon be relegated to a defensive stance.""",b99e657ba851a271e13e6969dda7c4b6,How many days after the Marines stopped the reoccupation of the Khe Sanh plateau did the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion land to the west of Khe Sanh?,73,12.0,nabert,1b65319beffa43efa75ffdb87c41e165,How many days after the Marines stopped the reoccupation of the Khe Sanh plateau did the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion land to the west of Khe Sanh?,73,19,naqanet,641bd3e1bbaf357cbc8dddab87713f03,How many days did Task Force Guadalcanal occupy the Khe Sanh area in operation Utah Mesa?,27,-6,naqanet,7bf611eddad38866329732934614e5ba,How many months after the Marines stopped the reoccupation of the Khe Sanh plateau did the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion land to the west of Khe Sanh?,2,4,nabert,a211a5d9427f3121fed133b4373a8fc3,How many years did the Army occupy Hill 950?,2,3,naqanet,2f5349af1be244b73a10639e8b93b2a2,"How many years, roughly, did the Army control Hill 950?",2,3,naqanet,5d588de7446d42f6534f4d1a69310b27,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"While The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature states that modernism ended by c. 1939 with regard to British and American literature, ""When (if) Modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to Modernism occurred.""  Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts, but with regard to music, Paul Griffiths (writer) notes that, while Modernism ""seemed to be a spent force"" by the late 1920s, after World War II, ""a new generation of composers-Pierre Boulez, Jean Barraqué, Milton Babbitt, Luigi Nono, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Iannis Xenakis"" revived modernism"". In fact many literary Modernists lived into the 1950s and 1960s, though generally they were no longer producing major works. The term ""late modernism"" is also sometimes applied to Modernist works published after 1930. Among Modernists (or late Modernists) still publishing after 1945 were Wallace Stevens, Gottfried Benn, T. S. Eliot, Anna Akhmatova, William Faulkner, Dorothy Richardson, John Cowper Powys, and Ezra Pound. Basil Bunting, born in 1901, published his most important Modernist poem Briggflatts in 1965. In addition, Hermann Brochs The Death of Virgil was published in 1945 and Thomas Manns Doctor Faustus (novel) in 1947. Samuel Beckett, who died in 1989, has been described as a ""later Modernist"". Beckett is a writer with roots in the expressionist tradition of Modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including Molloy (novel) (1951), Waiting for Godot (1953), Happy Days (play) (1961), and Rockaby (1981). The terms ""minimalist"" and ""post-Modernist"" have also been applied to his later works. The poets Charles Olson (1910-1970) and J. H. Prynne (born 1936) are among the writers in the second half of the 20th century who have been described as late Modernists.",ec82f2173d18b293811fa28fd9a6c56d,How many years after producing Happy Days did Beckett produce Rockaby?.,20,-20,naqanet,ffb143c23cdb9cd74000fdc8170377e6,How many years after producing Molloy did Beckett produce Happy Days?.,10,38,naqanet,2eae329fb7f5d929ebf33bf361b66de3,How many years after producing Molloy did Beckett produce Rockaby?.,30,20.0,nabert,e7a005aec2ee8278efeaed6dbf9ae657,How many years after producing Molloy did Beckett produce Rockaby?.,30,8,naqanet,0bb844a992198e48e2787403330092b9,How many years after producing Molly did Beckett produce Waiting for Godot?.,2,-1953,naqanet,02af5960af22c207c807a638b51b7293,How many years after producing Molly did Beckett produce Waiting for Godot?.,2,-8.0,nabert,3c544149e0a7fd647ac5bee228a7e176,How many years after producing Waiting for Godot did Beckett produce Rockaby?.,28,-1953,naqanet,c18bdf1745609509da7be06441c4cb93,What all works did Samuel Beckett produce?,Molloy Waiting for Godot Happy Days Rockaby,post-Modernist,naqanet,bafb9bc45fc3447498c8d6838eb3e1f4,What all works did Samuel Beckett produce?,Molloy Waiting for Godot Happy Days Rockaby,"until the 1980s , including molloy ( novel ) ( 1951 ) , waiting for godot ( 1953 ) , happy days",nabert,c126a96fec7f10bf44ea8ebb62c5d2c2,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Wilkins was honored by several sports publications the next season as the NBA Comeback Player of the Year. He scored an average of 27.7 points per game in the first month of the season. He then suffered a setback when he fractured the ring finger on his right hand on December 15, sitting out the next 11 games. He returned to rack up 29.4 points per game on .487 shooting in January, then added 31.5 points per game on .519 shooting in February.

"Willie Parker missed his fourth game due to a knee injury. Santonio Holmes also missed the game after a ""small quantity of marijuana"" was found in his car and the team placed him on the inactive list. Mewelde Moore opened up the game's scoring with a 32-yard touchdown run on the Steelers opening drive. The 5-1 New York Giants responded with a field goal on the ensuing drive. Pittsburgh stopped the Giants on four consecutive plays from inside the Steelers 2-yard line to force a turnover on downs. But were unable to score when two Ben Roethlisberger interceptions and a punt lead to two more field goals in the second quarter for the Giants. At 10:10 of the third quarter Roethlisberger completed a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14-9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of the end zone on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison&#8212;who was called in to replace injured long snapper Greg Warren&#8212;snapped the ball out of the end zone to give the Giants a safety and tie the game.

"With Spain's transition to democracy following Franco's death, celebration of the comuneros started to become permissible again.  On April 23, 1976, a small ceremony was held clandestinely in Villalar; only two years later, in 1978, the event had become a huge demonstration of 200,000 in support of Castilian autonomy.  The autonomous community of Castile and León was created in response to public demand in 1983, and it recognized April 23 as an official holiday in 1986.  Similarly, each February 3 since 1988 has been celebrated by the Castilian nationalist party Tierra Comunera in Toledo.

"With a 93-82 win over the Chicago Bulls on April 13, 2005, the Wizards clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 1996-97. Long-suffering fans celebrated by buying over 16,000 playoff tickets in two and a half hours the day tickets went on sale. In game 3 of the 2005 NBA Playoffs against the Bulls, the Wizards won their first playoff game since 1988. Adding to the ""long-overdue"" feeling was the fact that game 3 was the first NBA playoff game to be held within Washington, D.C. city limits. In the Wizards game 5 victory in Chicago, Arenas hit a buzzer-beater to win the game and the Wizards took their first lead in a playoff series since 1986.

"Within one week from the start of Operation Barbarossa, Heydrich issued an order to his Einsatzkommandos for the on-the-spot execution of all Bolsheviks, interpreted by the SS to mean all Jews. One of the first indiscriminate massacres of men, women, and children in Reichskommissariat Ukraine took the lives of over 4,000 Polish Jews in Łuck Ghetto on 2-4 July 1941, murdered by Einsatzkommando 4a assisted by the Ukrainian Peoples Militia. Formed officially on 20 August 1941, the Reichskommissariat Ukraine - stretching from prewar east-central Poland to Crimea - had become operational theatre of the Einsatzgruppe C. Within the Soviet Union proper, between 9 July 1941 and 19 September 1941 the city of Zhytomyr was made Judenfrei in three murder operations conducted by German and Ukrainian police in which 10,000 Jews perished. In the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre of 26-28 August 1941 some 23,600 Jews were shot in front of open pits (including 14,000-18,000 people expelled from Hungary). After an 1941 Bila Tserkva massacre in which 90 small children left behind had to be shot separately, Paul Blobel requested that Jewish mothers hold them in their arms during mass shootings. Long before the conference at Wannsee, 28,000 Jews were shot by SS and Ukrainian military in Vinnytsia on 22 September 1941, followed by the 29 September massacre of 33,771 Jews at Babi Yar. In Dnipropetrovsk, on 13 October 1941 some 10,000-15,000 Jews were shot. In Chernihiv, 10,000 Jews were put to death and only 260 Jews were spared. In mid-October, during the Kryvyi Rih massacre of 4,000-5,000 Soviet Jews the entire Ukrainian Auxiliary Police force actively participated. In the first days of January 1942 in Kharkiv, 12,000 Jews were murdered, but smaller massacres continued in this period on daily basis in countless other locations. In August 1942 in the presence of only a few German SS men over 5,000 Jews were massacred in Polish Zofjówka by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police leading to the towns complete sweep from existence.",eeaf6cda4ff450f43820fe0413c68b84,How many Jews in total were killed in October 1941?,30000,12260,naqanet,376c91266af87992bd0025163d57a7fe,How many Jews in total were killed in October 1941?,30000,25000.0,nabert,c432b1b1ab83ab477f80ef2c060f8bf7,How many Jews were killed during the week of Setember 22 to September 29?,61771,11740,naqanet,7a198104a2ecc36f275a74693b2a45b7,How many Jews were killed during the week of Setember 22 to September 29?,61771,34031.0,nabert,877f8e94327ec14950fd59c0025cceb4,How many days passed between the Jews being shot by the SS and the massacre at Babi Yar?,7,-33742.0,nabert,79ce656d7bd85ec001227ac0e3990fb7,How many days passed between the Jews being shot by the SS and the massacre at Babi Yar?,7,16,naqanet,4872165ff153ddd304ca2931e501d84b,What places were Jews killed in October 1941?,Soviet Union Dnipropetrovsk Chernihiv,Chernihiv,naqanet,283b5955ec4179b5abf500f20d192f60,What places were Jews killed in October 1941?,Soviet Union Dnipropetrovsk Chernihiv,kamianets - podilskyi massacre,nabert,fa0747406ab91240f3cb1c486b783a25,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"at Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Florida TV Time: CBS 1:00pm eastern The Ravens opened the regular season on the road against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on September 10. In QB Steve McNair's inaugural start as a Raven, the team gave a dominating performance. RB Jamal Lewis got the team's first points as he ran into the endzone on a four-yard touchdown strike in the first quarter. Then, in the second quarter, CB Chris McAlister intercepted a pass from Tampa Bay QB Chris Simms and ran 60 yards for another touchdown. Rookie Haloti Ngata recorded his first career interception and also returned for 60 yards to set up kicker Matt Stover with a 20-yard field goal to put the Ravens up 17-0 at halftime. Baltimore continued to suppress Tampa Bay in the second half, as Stover kicked a 42-yard field goal in the third quarter to put Baltimore up 20-0. In the fourth quarter, McNair put the game away with a 4-yard pass to TE Daniel Wilcox. While the Ravens offense had a very good start to the 2006 season, the defense also showed much promise, as they forced Simms into throwing three interceptions and limited star RB Carnell ""Cadillac"" Williams to just 22 yards on eight carries. For his efforts in this game Ray Lewis was named NFL Defensive Player of the Week after recording 10 tackles and a sack.

"at the Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana Following two-straight wins over two division opponents (the Bucs and the Panthers), the Falcons flew to the Louisiana Superdome to take on the New Orleans Saints (who were playing in the Superdome for the first time since Dec. '04) for an NFC South match-up on Monday Night.  From the get-go the Falcons trailed, when they had a punt blocked by Saints safety Steve Gleason and DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone for the touchdown.  The Falcons would respond, as kicker Morten Andersen (who used to play for the Saints) kicked a 26-yard field goal.  That would be their only score of the night, as WR Devery Henderson ran for an 11-yard TD on a reverse.  Then, Saints kicker John Carney would provide the remaining points for the New Orleans, as he kicked two field goals in the second quarter (a 37-yarder and a 51-yarder) and one field goal in the third (a 20-yarder).  The Falcons would fall to 2-1, as their offense got swapped, battered, and bruised.

"Švitrigaila was losing his influence in the Slavic principalities and could no longer resist Poland and Sigismund. On 4 September 1437 he attempted to reconcile with Poland: he would rule the lands that still backed him , and after his death these territories would pass to the King of Poland. However, under strong protest from Sigismund, the Polish Senate declined to ratify the treaty . In 1438 Švitrigaila withdrew to Moldavia. The reign of Sigismund Kęstutaitis was brief — he was assassinated in 1440. Švitrigaila returned from exile in 1442 and ruled Lutsk until his death a decade later. Jogaila's son Casimir IV Jagiellon, born in 1426, received approval as a hereditary hospodar from Lithuania's ruling families in 1440. This event is seen by the historians Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki as marking the end of the succession dispute.",457cffab7141813aa2b6a5faafe07e8e,How many years did Švitrigaila withdrew to Moldavia before returned from exile and ruled Lutsk?,4,-4,naqanet,1cc5b8b250540e7359830eb0d9a81e70,How many years was Svitrigaila in excie in Moldavia?,4,0.0,nabert,6fe1509eb0813980fb1e60c91680fc90,How many years was Svitrigaila in excie in Moldavia?,4,2,naqanet,a6f32b8502b910f364b3b857f14e7f6c,What caused Sigismund Kęstutaiti's reign to end?,assassinated,he was assassinated,nabert,263b8bf93c28a4ec2662082f19347417,"What event happened first, Švitrigaila withdrew to Moldavia or Švitrigaila returned from exile",Švitrigaila withdrew to Moldavia,svitrigaila withdrew to moldavia,nabert,aa835ead4d6d32c88f6fc7c1df261919,What happened first: he was assassinated or attempted to reconcile with Poland?,attempted to reconcile with Poland,he was assassinated,naqanet,4003c22d40e7abacca91e6d26b0e5b37,What happened second: he was assassinated or attempted to reconcile with Poland?,he was assassinated,attempted to reconcile with Poland,naqanet,4d372f3865c0b98877aed859d7adc66b,What year did Svitrigaila go into exile?,1438,1442,naqanet,c2ccb07f8abeb2bcff5faeacccb9c28f,What year did Svitrigalia die?,1452,1441.0,nabert,33dfdf1bb6bd0294cf4d55b350b393f3,What year did Svitrigalia die?,1452,1442,naqanet,9dd4783bfad1be38385bfee76bbf2c09,What year did Švitrigaila die?,1440,1441.0,nabert,bdaf613cabcec2663b5cbf3fd424b029,What year did Švitrigaila die?,1440,1442,naqanet,adf7b539d56f953d7b47a92c50aed2ac,When did Švitrigaila die?,1452,1442,naqanet,31cbaa72569f1d95f1e2c14fb9cbb94f,When did Švitrigaila die?,1452,1446.0,nabert,47f264cb50d904e1c12f0362ba1b8d99,Who was born first: Švitrigaila or Jagiellon?,Švitrigaila,svitrigaila,nabert,d36221f70817f3f400f28c584c7b3e8e,"Who was ruler first, Sigismund of Casimir IV Jagiellon?",Sigismund,Casimir,naqanet,18401284fd1fd401e907958b29ed0433,Whose approval as a hereditary hospodar marked the end of the succession dispute?,Casimir IV Jagiellon,Jogaila,naqanet,381cce63dc68a7ada61200259550e242,Whose approval as a hereditary hospodar marked the end of the succession dispute?,Casimir IV Jagiellon,svitrigaila,nabert,81198ac578b9afd34293676acfdf0170,Whose treaty did the Polish Senate decline to ratify?,Švitrigaila,Sigismund,naqanet,ed612c524ada329c4347fa7a7e2a4085,none,none,none,none,none
