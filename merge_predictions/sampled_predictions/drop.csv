To resolve this, they ultimately recommend the reestablishment of ""meritoric principles"" and ""blindly graded objective central exams,"" as opposed to ""affirmative action,"" in education.",f2114aca45b1be741e87ab705032fb3a,How many reasons are cited as causing the persistent gap between white and black IQs?,6,5,nabert,5e3e068feeb926586000b25101d2bfc7,How many reasons are cited as causing the persistent gap between white and black IQs?,6,2,naqanet,8bcc4f5c5044ee484147ca5668aca752,How many points did the black-white IQ gap decrease from 1971-2008?,6.39,17,naqanet,91953a24fd2afbda4c1c66df236d2036,Which race had the lowest IQ means range from 1971 to 2008 in the analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress?,black,black-white IQ,naqanet,689cad2fb0e030945788cd93799ba215,How many people authored the study released in 2013?,3,2,naqanet,e538fcb508354186a059cfbb15479827,How many IQ points did the black-white IQ gap decrease between 1971 and 2008?,6.39,2,naqanet,576c4f31fabf85879525892fb53a2318,Which race had the lowest IQ means range from 1971 to 2008 in the analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress?,black,black - white,nabert,5525f43d5420ac7eb00cb8abac2c947c,How many IQ points did the black-white IQ gap decrease between 1971 and 2008?,6.39,-6.389999999999999,nabert,cf511260241696782451900e61348176,"In a study published in 2013, who was estimated to have the higher IQ means between 17-year-old black, white or Hispanic students?",white,heiner rindermann,nabert,a7af387dcaf66849a8202e320d77544b,How many points difference is the IQ range in 17-year-old black students?,3.7,0.6700000000000017,nabert,4ac553536c5ab8619e0bb7f225aff7a7
"A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43,796 inhabitants, 79% of whom were Chinese (71% of the Chinese were Hakka people), 14% Malay, and 6% Indian. Another estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20,000. In 1931, 61% of Kuala Lumpurs 111,418 inhabitants were Chinese, and in 1947 63.5%. The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers, in part due to government employment, as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived. Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled, increasing from 12.5 to 15%, while the proportion of Chinese dropped. The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service, and later the implementation of the Malaysian New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business. In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million, with 52% Chinese, 33% Malay, and 15% Indian. From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77%, but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43% compared to Bumiputras at 38%. By the 2010 census, according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non-citizens, the percentage of the Bumiputera (Malaysia) population in Kuala Lumpur had reached around 45.9% (44.7% Malay), with the Chinese population at 43.2% and Indians 10.3%.",9c73a108d1fa72a2ee55f54b64767cc8,How many percent of people were not Chinese in 1947?,36.5,0,naqanet,1ef40e41894d4cbe0f326780f42cda05,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1980?,67,0,naqanet,56ed0512550465ccae3e8d11714678f7,How many percent of people were not Chinese in 1931?,39,0,naqanet,0668578c1c662f07db1d2be8f478255b,How many percent of people were not Chinese in 1891?,21,71,naqanet,bf93d6986472e274f00c56e9adaa8f33,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1947?,87.5,0,naqanet,aeed26f4e2e85d97b94f166a97f5744a,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1957?,85,0,naqanet,8d660121aade34a2a82b793f62569532,How many percent of people were not Malay in 1947?,87.5,36.5,nabert,d5886b4448e73a56e86aa0e919d21658,How many percent of people were not Indian in 1891?,94,0,naqanet,953cac8e05d68d57b14ad7f4a1a59f78,How many percent of people were not Bumiputras  in 2000?,62,39,naqanet,93a1daa635997a1ad9dab94b9d00f5be,How many percent of people were not Indian in 1980?,85,94.0,nabert,0178ad4aaaafb1aee2940a3e605ee736

"After 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009. In 2009 the U.S. membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of private sector unions for the first time, at 7.9 million and 7.4 million respectively. In 2011 states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack especially in Wisconsin, as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures. Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain.  Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.",a36e810e42297c7d73681948579b195a,How many more state and government jobs were there in 2009 than 1976?,4600000,8,naqanet,56fe4a66cd20a738824d192e55114b15,How many jobs did state and local-government raise between 1950-1976?,8000000,8,naqanet,d90bee0a2e0c1abea5099c1c42950b4e,How many more union jobs were there in 2009 compared to 1950?,12600000,12600000.000000002,nabert,0c519c3b0e08d9a54bbd018c62862e87,How many state and local government employees increased from 1950 to 2009?,12600000,3,naqanet,4672a7ffa7dacec2af8d986e836a9223,How many states had public sector unions come under heavy attack?,4,3,naqanet,560e2842a513064dfdc3dad38fab44e6,How many state and local government employees increased from 1950 to 2009?,12600000,12600000.000000002,nabert,dce3b342005cc75f4ecb8aa7f6291591,How many years did it take to quadruple state- and local-government employment?,59,-1917,naqanet,58d0633e23171ac3bd0bda96d7c15db7,What did the Conservatives argue public unions were too powerful for?,helped elect their bosses overly generous pension systems,elect their bosses,nabert,391ab9c4eb7731c35031795584cb998f,How many years did it take to quadruple state- and local-government employment?,59,26.0,nabert,b0b1ab63ba23a450afc450e9aa8bfc23,How many more union jobs were there in 2009 compared to 1950?,12600000,8,naqanet,bde88017a5ae2e614d8d0cddc29b2562
"After Culloden, government forces spent the next few weeks searching for rebels, confiscating cattle and burning Non-Juring Episcopalian and Catholic meeting houses; many of those who participated in the Rebellion came from this element of Scottish society. Prisoners from regiments in the French service were treated as POWs and exchanged, but 3,500 captured Jacobites were indicted for treason. 650 of these died awaiting trial, 120 were executed , 900 were pardoned and the rest transported. The Jacobite lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino and Lovat were beheaded on Tower Hill in April 1747, but these were among the last executions. Public sympathies had shifted and Cumberland's insistence on severity earned him the nickname 'Butcher' from a City of London alderman. The last Jacobite to be executed was Doctor Archibald Cameron, younger brother of Lochiel. Convicted of treason for his part in the 45, he escaped into exile; when he returned to Scotland in March 1753, he was allegedly betrayed by members of his own clan and executed in London on 7 June.",327303287e0635559f68343105062d20,What happened first: earned him the nickname 'Butcher' or last Jacobite to be executed?,the nickname 'Butcher',butcher,nabert,e1b01503bb697afa1216406da34fd0cb,What happened first: earned him the nickname 'Butcher' or last Jacobite to be executed?,the nickname 'Butcher',earned him the nickname 'Butcher' or last Jacobite to be executed,naqanet,9bc62d95e19b47ef37ac71bad25fc190,"Of the 3,500 Jacobites that were captured and indited for treason how many lived?",2730,3500,naqanet,7c40930fbd611bedac529495014b1f79,Doctor Archibald Cameron was executed how many years after Balmerio was?,6,1753,naqanet,7090ace1580336229f522a67580df884,How many of the captured Jacobites lost their lives either waiting for trial or by being executed?,770,530,naqanet,cb8fffc71f605576306120b416e7944c,How many months after Doctor Archibald returned to Scotland in 1753 was he executed?,3,2,naqanet,79a8aca40425f8b3c0d905e765aae80d,How many of the captured Jacobites lost their lives either waiting for trial or by being executed?,770,4150.0,nabert,b93453abf8eefaea404cd26a1c9eda70,How many months after returning to Scotland was Archibald Cameron executed?,3,2,naqanet,f48cff0d2c793445bc95aed7c6f987b2,Doctor Archibald Cameron died how?,executed,brother of Lochiel.

"After the Battle of Deçiq Ottoman government decided for peaceful means of suppression of the revolt because frequent clashes with Albanians attracted the attention of the  European Great Powers. On 11 June sultan Mehmed V visited Skopje where he was greeted enthusiastically by the local population together with two Albanian chieftains who swore their allegiance to the Ottoman sultan. On 15 June, the date of the Battle of Kosovo, he visited the site of the historical battle greeted by 100.000 people. During his visit to Kosovo vilayet he signed a general amnesty for all participants of the Albanian revolts of 1910 and 1911. He was welcomed by the choir of the Serbian Orthodox Seminary with Turkish songs and vice-consul Milan Rakić had gathered a large contingent of Serbs, but many Albanians boycotted the event. Ottoman representatives managed to deal with the leaders of Albanian rebels in Kosovo Vilayet and Scutari Vilayet separately, because they were not united and lacked central control. The Ottoman Empire first managed to pacify the northern Albanian malësorë  from Scutari Vilayet reaching a compromise during a meeting in Podgorica. In order to resolve the problems in the south, the Ottoman representatives invited Albanian southern leaders to a meeting in Tepelenë on 18 August 1911. They promised to meet most of their demands, like general amnesty, the opening of Albanian language schools, and the restriction that military service was to be performed only in the territory of the vilayets with substantial Albanian population.

"After the end of Forty Years' War in 1424, Ava gave up its dream of rebuilding the Pagan Empire. Instead, for the next six decades, it would struggle to hold on to its vassal states. Rebellions arose every time a new king came to power. The new king would have to reestablish his power all over again by gaining the fealty of all the vassal states, usually by show of force. Of these, the remote vassal state of Toungoo , tucked away in the southeastern corner across the Pegu Yoma range, proved most troublesome to successive kings at Ava. Toungoo lords rebelled against Ava in 1426-1440, 1451-1459 and 1468-1470, usually with Pegu's implicit or explicit support. Ava also faced rebellions at Mohnyin  and Prome . The beginning of the end of Ava came in 1480. The new king Minkhaung II was greeted with a multitude of rebellions but it proved to be different this time. The most serious rebellion was by his younger brother, lord of Yamethin. With a serious rebellion so close to Ava, vassal states broke away one by one. The Yamethin rebellion went on until 1500.

"After the fall of Pegu in December 1599, Lower Burma was in utter chaos, and politically fragmented among Toungoo, Prome, Arakanese/Portuguese Syriam and Siamese Martaban. In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma. In early 1606, his 7,000-strong forces took Theinni, Thibaw and Momeik but the king died during the campaign on 3 March 1606.",7c625bddfd7ced397993a3bdcf39ecdb,What states did Nyaungyan recapture in 1601 and 1603 after he became king?,Nyaungshwe Mone,Bhamo,naqanet,b721f41b0bfff9a9d799e42e3e7ba098,How many months after Toungoo and Arakanese laid siege on Pegu did it fall?,4,2,naqanet,5f45463c452eaa97fb220b7dce6dec40,How many months after Pegu fall did Nyaungyan declare himself king?,2,1,nabert,bb08f368df93641ebde05200b9264b56,Nyaungyan declared himself king how many years before the march to attack Mone?,5,-1600,naqanet,8f4a69d03281429bfe1a6df81d3df068,What states did Nyaungyan recapture in 1601 and 1603 after he became king?,Nyaungshwe Mone,shan state of mone,nabert,fc02075dfa9bfb6f01ef4c7b14ab66d5,When did Naresuan of Siam die?,April 1605,1605,naqanet,294e0bf274a2981a58313afa300890f6,"How many months after Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo did he declare himself king?",4,2,naqanet,85bb3f96cc49518d9be6e6439a10320a,How many months after Toungoo and Arakanese laid siege on Pegu did it fall?,4,1,nabert,bb4a2145e9e86cbbf554e09762b3a1d8,How many years after Pegu fell did the king die?,7,-1593,naqanet,ccca8b900fa3ee19a8bdd09a63dea157,When did  Naresuan of Siam die?,April 1605,1605,naqanet,8b4376fccfcd8e04e175425e3c3e33c4

"All these problems came to a head on 1 June 1648, upon Alexei I's return to Moscow from the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra monastery. A crowd of Muscovites surrounded the Tsar and complained about the boyars and prikaz officials. Instead of hearing the petition, the royal bodyguards started dispersing the crowd, pushing them away from the Tsar. This unexpected reaction caused a major outbreak of anger among the people. On 2 June the insurgents burst into the Moscow Kremlin and demanded the surrender of Leontii Pleshcheyev , Duma diak Nazar Chistoy , boyar Boris Morozov  and his brother-in-law Pyotr Trakhaniotov . Morozov commanded the Streltsy  to drive the rioters out of the Kremlin, but they refused. When not acting as the Tsar's bodyguards, the musketeers held artisanal jobs in Moscow. This conflict of interest led them to side with the plight of the townsmen, stating that they, ""...did not want to stand in antagonistic relations with the crowd for the sake of the traitor and tyrant Pleshcheyev."" The people would not hear the Tsar's heartfelt pleas to spare Pleshceyev and, on June 3, Alexei surrendered the official. In their fervor, the crowd did not wait for Pleshcheyev to be executed instead, ""...they cuggeled him so black and blue and with axes they cut him asunder like a fish, the pieces they let lie naked here and there.""

"Although it failed to dislodge the Burmese from Kengtung and Sipsongpanna at the beginning of the century , Siam never gave up its claims on these lands. They tested the waters in 1849, by raiding as far north as Kengtung. But when the Second Anglo-Burmese War started, the Siamese viewed it as their opportunity to take over the trans-Salween states. In late 1852, a large infantry and elephant force marched from Chiang Mai and launched a two-pronged invasion of Kengtung. Burma couldrespond only after the new king Mindon had seized power in February 1853. Because he was still concerned about the British threat, Mindon could only send several thousand infantry troops from the Mone  garrison to relieve the Siamese siege of Kengtung. With the troops by Kenghung sawbwa, the Burmese eventually drove out the Siamese but only after heavy loss of life. In 1854, the largest Siamese invasion force, consisted of Laotian levies, tried once more. But this time, with the British front quiet, the Burmese were ready. Mindon had deployed a larger, well-equipped army . The Siamese forces again reached Kengtung but could not break through.

"Another factor in the revolt of 1381 was the conduct of the war with France. In 1337 Edward III of England had pressed his claims to the French throne, beginning a long-running conflict that became known as the Hundred Years' War. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England. By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in Calais and Brest alone, for example, were costing £36,000 a year to maintain, while military expeditions could consume £50,000 in only six months.

"Armenia gave way to communist power in late 1920. The Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started on the 29th of November 1920. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan, when the Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of the Nagorno-Karabagh and Syunik regions of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik as a self-governing region on December 25, 1920. In January 1921 Drastamat Kanayan sent a telegram to Njdeh, suggesting allowing the sovietisation of Syunik, through which they could gain the support of the Bolshevik government in solving the problems of the Armenian lands.

"As Somalia gained military strength, Ethiopia grew weaker. In September 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie had been overthrown by the Derg , marking a period of turmoil. The Derg quickly fell into internal conflict to determine who would have primacy. Meanwhile, various anti-Derg as well as separatist movements began throughout the country. The regional balance of power now favoured Somalia. One of the separatist groups seeking to take advantage of the chaos was the pro-Somalia Western Somali Liberation Front  operating in the Somali-inhabited Ogaden area, which by late 1975 had struck numerous government outposts. From 1976 to 1977, Somalia supplied arms and other aid to the WSLF. A sign that order had been restored among the Derg was the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state on February 11, 1977. However, the country remained in chaos as the military attempted to suppress its civilian opponents in a period known as the Red Terror . Despite the violence, the Soviet Union, which had been closely observing developments, came to believe that Ethiopia was developing into a genuine Marxist-Leninist state and that it was in Soviet interests to aid the new regime. They thus secretly approached Mengistu with offers of aid that he accepted. Ethiopia closed the U.S. military mission and the communications centre in April 1977. In June 1977, Mengistu accused Somalia of infiltrating SNA soldiers into the Somali area to fight alongside the WSLF. Despite considerable evidence to the contrary, Barre strongly denied this, saying SNA ""volunteers"" were being allowed to help the WSLF.",18950a8aa672713cf86b0b48cbdfa30b,How many months after Mengistu Haile Mariam was made head of state did Ethiopia close the U.S. military mission and the communications centre?,2,1966.0,nabert,58947fb357c189a04248dd2ed4cc7886,How many months was it from the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state to Mengistu accusing Somalia of having SNA soldiers joining the WSLF?,4,2,naqanet,c713323ce049b6c594c9075e0453b84a,"Which came first, the Red Terror or the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state?",the Red Terror,announcement of mengistu haile mariam as head of state,nabert,c39d86b2208cc9c87d61a611ec36ca8f,How many total years did Somalia supply arms and other aid to the WSLF?,2,1,naqanet,614061bede2fc05e798084233aeac309,How many years after the period of turmoil for the Dergs did the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state take place to try and restore order?,3,0.0,nabert,80a3f3695703b277061eb4df60465bbd,"Which happened first, the closing of the military mission or Soviet Union approaching Mengistu with aid?",offers of aid,secretly approached Mengistu,naqanet,44be7a86541e119c41259710cf3d72ec,"Which came first, the Red Terror or the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state?",the Red Terror,announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head,naqanet,319b96c8199eb30ecfe09c0c6ff31670,Where were the Derg located?,Somalia,ethiopia,nabert,3ee29d010f24d92bed3059e749f45cc7,Where were the Derg located?,Somalia,WSLF,naqanet,5f85a2ffd743cde9a12739c6d9c305ee,"Which happened first, the closing of the military mission or Soviet Union approaching Mengistu with aid?",offers of aid,closing of the military mission,nabert,40b106390db571c8a4f2e562c255d1c0

"As with most civil wars, the internecine conflict left a bitter legacy, which continues to influence Irish politics to this day. The two largest political parties in the republic through most of its history  were Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the descendants respectively of the anti-treaty and pro-treaty forces of 1922. Until the 1970s, almost all of Ireland's prominent politicians were veterans of the Civil War, a fact which poisoned the relationship between Ireland's two biggest parties. Examples of Civil War veterans include: Republicans Éamon de Valera, Frank Aiken, Todd Andrews, and Seán Lemass; and Free State supporters W. T. Cosgrave, Richard Mulcahy and Kevin O'Higgins. Moreover, many of these men's sons and daughters also became politicians, meaning that the personal wounds of the civil war were felt over three generations. In the 1930s, after Fianna Fáil took power for the first time, it looked possible for a while that the Civil War might break out again between the IRA and the pro-Free State Blueshirts. Fortunately, this crisis was averted, and by the 1950s violence was no longer prominent in politics in the Republic of Ireland. However, the breakaway IRA continued  to exist. It was not until 1948 that the IRA renounced military attacks on the forces of the southern Irish state when it became the Republic of Ireland. After this point, the organisation dedicated itself primarily to the end of British rule in Northern Ireland. The IRA Army Council still makes claim to be the legitimate Provisional Government of the Irish Republic declared in 1918 and annulled by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.",d9749337d8e612da04e2f27e5c1d0874,Which political group in Ireland ascended to power first?,Fine Gael,fianna fail,nabert,a15945a375598f2fd0d175069cee6ca6,How many Free State Supporter Civil War veterans are listed?,3,4,nabert,b00fbe8271ad2d381d587fe1b2565c82,What were most of the politicians in Ireland?,veterans of the Civil War,fianna fail,nabert,486995376293fe8a2915df10c4edb870,How many Civil War veterans are listed?,7,2,naqanet,0aa5a1b391a3336f059dc3c391225448,Who did they fear would start another civil war?,IRA pro-Free State Blueshirts,Fine Gael,naqanet,2f2698b63872e7f2489cc0a9aa73433a,Who did they fear would start another civil war?,IRA pro-Free State Blueshirts,fianna fail and fine gael,nabert,1aee74a270bbce176ddecab7063213ff,How many years was the IRA Army Council the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic until it was annuled by the Anglo-Irish Treaty?,3,27.0,nabert,96af87848c8d8822dda51f13dc8675d1,What is the name of the treaty that was annulled,Anglo-Irish Treaty,Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921,naqanet,fe268b9f581808e6950ab18b59714f70,How many republican Civil War veterans are listed?,4,2,naqanet,2d46d0293b0c0c4676b4e406441c75b7,How many Free State Supporter Civil War veterans are listed?,3,2,naqanet,c96b11cd40f148d704ce1fac7cb2ac68
"Ava's authority deteriorated further in Shwenankyawshin's reign . Three of the king's own brothers openly raised a rebellion in 1501. Mohnyin, Ava's former vassal, now began to raid its territory. In 1507, Ava ceded to Mohnyin all northern Avan territory down to present-day Shwebo in the vain hope that the raids would stop. It did not. Ava desperately tried to retain Toungoo's loyalty by ceding the key Kyaukse granary to Toungoo but it too failed. Toungoo took the region but formally broke away in 1510. Ava's only ally was the Shan state of Thibaw , which too was fighting Mohnyin's raids on its territory. Mohnyin was attacking other Shan states when it was not raiding Ava. It seized Bhamo from Thibaw in 1512 in the east, and raiding Kale in the west. The Ava-Thibaw alliance was able to retake Shwebo for a time but Mohnyin proved too strong. By the early 1520s, Chief Sawlon of Mohnyin had assembled a confederation of Shan states  under his leadership. Prome had also joined the confederation. The confederation wiped out Ava's defences in Shwebo in 1524. Finally on 25 March 1527, the forces of the confederation and Prome took Ava. The Confederation later sacked Prome in 1533 because Sawlon felt that Prome had not given sufficient help.",8efe0ec46c4357a6cc6c94ce2ffb2c2c,Who seized Bhamo in 1512?,Mohnyin,Ava,naqanet,7996db96596f6b9dd106acba4e45ad9f,How many years was it between when Ava ceded all northern Avan territory to Mohnyin and when the forces of the confederation and Prome took Ava?,17,20,naqanet,9c7366e9d97fb8fd645b77eb45c0fc10,What happened first: king's brothers raised a rebellion or confederation and Prome took Ava?,king's brothers raised a rebellion,king ' s brothers raised a rebellion,nabert,1e8c7894e6622587ea662134332ababc,Which cities did Mohnyin seize and raid in 1512?,Bhamo Kale,Bhamo,naqanet,58f6742225ad0b61e61c6c44f374a031,"Which happened first, the seizure of Bhamo or the sacking of Prome by the Confederation?",seizure of Bhamo,seized bhamo,nabert,d1dc10f8d3baea2a0b7310dd66984801,"Which happened first, the forces of the confederation and Prome taking Ava or the king's brothers raising a rebellion?",king's brothers raising a rebellion,raised a rebellion,naqanet,83469f95bff1f5c4d6d9f140302ac28d,"Which happened first, the forces of the confederation and Prome taking Ava or the king's brothers raising a rebellion?",king's brothers raising a rebellion,king ' s own brothers openly raised a rebellion,nabert,892b160ddc1bb04582c0fe2948b217f6,Who seized Bhamo in 1512?,Mohnyin,thibaw,nabert,5c677f154a64b40ef103ea23094f21a9,"Which happened first, the seizure of Bhamo or the sacking of Prome by the Confederation?",seizure of Bhamo,The Confederation later sacked Prome,naqanet,cba8063452c85e40a1523f7821a4b41d,"After the rebellions began in 1501, how many years did Ava last before it was finally taken?",26,6.0,nabert,43bd7988b611c569bc815ff0a24a69fb

"Before the Monthon reforms initiated by king Chulalongkorn, Siamese territories were divided into three categories: Inner Provinces forming the core of the kingdom, Outer Provinces that were adjacent to the inner provinces and tributary states located on the border regions. The area of southern Laos that came under Siamese control following the Lao rebellion  and destruction of Vientiane belonged to the later category, maintaining relative autonomy. Lao nobles who had received the approval of the Siamese king exercised authority on the Lao population as well as the Alak and Laven-speaking tribesmen. Larger tribal groups often raided weaker tribes abducting people and selling them into slavery at the trading hub of Champasak, while themselves falling prey to Khmer, Lao and Siamese slavers. From Champasak the slaves were transported to Phnom-Penh and Bangkok, thus creating a large profits for the slavers and various middlemen. In 1874 and 1884, king Chulalongkorn enacted two decrees banning the capture and sale of Kha slaves while also freeing all slaves born after 1868. Those abolitionist policies had an immediate effect on slave trading communities. In 1883, France attempted to expand its control in Southeast Asia by claiming that the Treaty of Huế extended into all Vietnamese vassal states. French troops gradually occupied the Kontum Plateau and pushed the Siamese from Laos following the Franco-Siamese War. A new buffer zone was thus created on the west bank of Mekong, as the area lacked the presence of the Siamese military local outlaws flocked the newly created safe haven. In 1899, Siam abolished the tributes collected from vassal states, replacing them with a new tax collected from all able bodied men, undermining the authority of Lao officials.

"Brandenburg-Prussia's claims in Silesia were based, in part, on a 1537 inheritance treaty between the Silesian duke Frederick II of Legnica and the Hohenzollern Prince-Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg, whereby the Silesian duchies of Liegnitz, Wohlau and Brieg were to pass to the Electorate of Brandenburg if the Silesian Piasts should become extinct. At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the ""Great Elector"" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage.",966a4c92b97a70872aeb139adb3af591,How many years after the Battle of White Mountain was won did the Emperor take back control of Schwiebus?,73,9.0,nabert,7a411b8b26c68e5c77aa390d6a6c1b27,What were the names of the people apart of the treaty?,Frederick II Joachim II,Frederick II of Legnica,naqanet,d83dd531f111b8c6e5ecbb60263d6455,Which two wars are mentioned?,Thirty Years' War Great Turkish War,great turkish war,nabert,be012e2b06caa66581aa787a6b025c1c,Who did the inheritance treaty involve?,Frederick II of Legnica Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg,brandenburg - prussia,nabert,012041bee1782482ab8137a6f5542156,Which two wars are mentioned?,Thirty Years' War Great Turkish War,Brandenburg-Prussia,naqanet,be147079fcf1c1bbe7f13a0f5024cf3e,What were the names of the people apart of the treaty?,Frederick II Joachim II,"duke frederick ii of legnica and the hohenzollern prince - elector joachim ii hector of brandenburg , whereby the silesian duchies of liegnitz",nabert,21492b520b565d8babee7aab0b089e8d,How many years before Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War was the battle of white mountain won?,64,9.0,nabert,7ea69ccdb4a6cd601711db6e7f70ea6a,How many years after Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf was the Great Turkish War?,82,66,naqanet,2c4f21009903c24fc9de9a1f33d0606b,Who did the inheritance treaty involve?,Frederick II of Legnica Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg,Frederick II of Legnica,naqanet,e4983c35cf6338df949ef334d28ea7cb,How many years after the inheritance treaty between the Silesian duke  and the Hohenzollern Prince-Elector did the Piast line end,138,66,naqanet,acf12a056ef898c97a71f72d09dce5a7
"By 2007, 56.8% of evacuees had found jobs, 22.3% were unemployed and seeking work, and 31.2% of evacuees were unemployed and living off government benefits rather than seeking work. The average monthly salary among the evacuees was NIS 5,380 (about $1,281), a slight rise of 2.1 percent from the average salary the year before. This was, however, a sharp drop of 39% from the settlers average monthly income before the disengagement. The average salary among evacuees was lower than the general average, as compared to above average before the disengagement. In addition to a drop in salary, the evacuees also suffered a drop in their standard of living due to the increased price of goods and services in their places of residence as compared to the settlements. Following the disengagement, settlers were temporarily relocated to hotels, sometimes for as long as half a year, before moving to mobile homes as temporary housing known as caravillas, before they could build proper homes. By June 2014, about 60% of evacuees were still living in these caravillas. Only 40% had moved to permanent housing, although construction of permanent settlements for the evacuees continues to progress. By July 2014, eleven towns for the evacuees had been completed with the expellees joining ten additional towns. Many of the permanent settlements under construction were given names reminiscent of the former Gaza settlements. By August 2014, unemployment among evacuees had dropped to 18%.

"By late August 1921, Spain lost all the territories it had gained since 1909. Spanish troops were pushed back to Melilla, which was their biggest base in the eastern Rif. Spain still had 14,000 soldiers in Melilla. However, Abd el-Krim ordered his forces not to attack the town. He subsequently told the writer J. Roger-Matthieu that since citizens of other European nations were residing in Melilla, it was feared they would intervene in the war should their citizens come to harm. Other reasons included the dispersal of Rifian fighters from several loosely allied tribes following the victory at Annual; and the arrival in Melilla of substantial reinforcements from the Legion and other Spanish units recalled from operations in western Morocco. By the end of August Spanish forces at Melilla numbered 36,000 under General Jose Sanjurjo and the slow process of recovering the lost territory could begin. Thus the Spanish could keep their biggest base in the eastern Rif. Later Abd el-Krim would admit: ""I bitterly regret this order. It was my biggest mistake. All the following tenor of events happened because of this mistake."" By January 1922 the Spanish had retaken their major fort at Monte Arruit  and had reoccupied the coastal plain as far as Tistutin and Batel. The Rifian forces had consolidated their hold of the inland mountains and stalemate was reached. The Spanish military suffered losses even at sea; in March the transport ship Juan de Joanes was sunk in Alhucemas Bay by Riffian coastal batteries, and in August 1923, while shelling Riffian positions, the battleship España ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas and was eventually scrapped in situ. In a bid to break the stalemate, the Spanish military turned to the use of chemical weapons against the Riffians.",2501b14b4470dc93b15fe7ee9511f187,"What event happened first, the Spanish military suffering losses even at sea, or the battleship Espana running aground?",Spanish military suffering losses,Spanish military suffered losses even at sea,naqanet,0c13829f732051bfc6f89fcd15d5d120,"What event happened first, Spain loosing all territories it had gained since 1909, or the Spanish retaking their major fort at Monte Arruit.",Spain loosing all territories,Spain lost all the territories,naqanet,69ddf18466eb16b8929cc2443e2f987f,What did Abd el-Krim regret not attacking?,Melilla,feared they would intervene,naqanet,c7aecd61626da50bef645896157166db,"Which was the Spanish military first suffered losses at sea, Jaun de Joanes or Espana?",Juan de Joanes,Jaun de Joanes,naqanet,cdbdd58bfa438da7f96d4848cc59b489,"What event happened first, Spain loosing all territories it had gained since 1909, or the Spanish retaking their major fort at Monte Arruit.",Spain loosing all territories,territories it had gained,nabert,8a8e39c2c6bc06feb7e72c7a25daaa37,Where is the city that Abd el-Krim ordered his forces not to attack?,eastern Rif,Spain,naqanet,cfe56f394fe647ca7c16c0d5f88565fa,"What event happened first, the Spanish military suffering losses even at sea, or the battleship Espana running aground?",Spanish military suffering losses,battleship espana,nabert,763ea5f275823a363c55aa3643bf1aa0,What did Abd el-Krim call his order?,biggest mistake,not to attack,nabert,7747cb81a2dcd5e985a274e08d4eeb3d,Where is the city that Abd el-Krim ordered his forces not to attack?,eastern Rif,melilla,nabert,9b09ba58338c0bc5340b0488c8869f05,What did Abd el-Krim regret not attacking?,Melilla,the town,nabert,0acf630b8f5ff8e4e1fbbcc51711793d
"By this time Hu Zongxian had almost collected his strength: Lu Tang had won a decisive victory in Taizhou south of Ningbo and came back to help deal with Xu Hai; while 6000 fresh aboriginal soldiers from Baojing and Yongshun were on its way to come to Hu Zongxian's aid. The imperial inspector Zhao Wenhua reiterated the emperor's wishes that surrender was not an option, so Hu Zongxian made a show of receiving Xu Hai's surrender while waiting for the opportune moment to strike. In the meantime Xu Hai had settled in the Shen Family Estate  of Pinghu, where he recruited up to 300 new followers by hosting banquets for his neighbours, adding to the thousand or more raiders still under his command and remnants of Chen Dong's group next to the estate.

"Charles reached Rome in 1265, but was temporarily halted by financial embarrassments.

"China is the second largest trading partner of Nepal. In 2015/16, total exports to China stood at US$181 million with marginal increase from US$179 million in the previous fiscal year. In contrast, import from China has been growing at the rate of 39 per cent per year. It rose from US$421 million in fiscal year 2009/10 to US$1,247 million in fiscal year 2015/16. As a result, the trade deficit with China has risen from US$401 million in 2009/10 to US$1228 million in 2015/16. Although, China has given zero tariff entry facility to over 8000 Nepali products starting from 2009, Nepal hasn’t been able to bring the trade deficit down. Nepal exports 370 products including noodles and agro products to China. Nepal regularly participates various trade fairs and exhibitions organized in China.

"Clad in all-blue uniforms for the first time in franchise history, Ron Dayne rushed for a career-high 153 yards and two touchdowns and Kris Brown kicked the winning 48-yard field goal as time expired to shock the Colts 27-24. The Texans used Dayne and rookie Chris Taylor to eat up the clock and exploit the Colts' suspect run defense, ranked last in the NFL, while taking pressure off David Carr and the struggling passing game. The win broke a nine-game losing streak to the Colts (11-4). It would be the Colts' last defeat before winning Super Bowl XLI. Mario Williams forced a Dominic Rhodes fumble on the Colts' second play. Anthony Weaver recovered the ball on the Indianapolis 47 and Houston would convert it into a touchdown, taking an early 14-0 lead. Houston led through most of the game until Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison connected for their second touchdown, a 7-yard pass that tied it 24-24 with 2:41 remaining. Carr and the Texans then engineered a six-play, 31-yard drive that ended with Brown's winning kick.

"Coming off a week 2 loss, the Ravens were determined to bounce back and fight hard. On their second offensive play from scrimmage, Flacco threw a 74-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Torrey Smith. It was the first catch of Smith's career and the longest pass of Flacco's career. Before the first quarter was up, Flacco would throw two more touchdown passes to Smith for 41 and 18 yards respectively, marking the 12th time in NFL history that any receiver caught three touchdown passes in a single quarter, and the first time ever for a rookie.

"Cosmetic surgery is a voluntary or elective surgery that is performed on normal parts of the body with the only purpose of improving a person’s appearance and/or removing signs of aging. In 2014, nearly 16 million cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled since the start of the century. 92% of cosmetic procedures were performed on women in 2014, up from 88% in 2001. Nearly 12 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2007, with the five most common surgeries being breast augmentation, liposuction, breast reduction, eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for 34 different cosmetic procedures. Nineteen of the procedures are surgical, such as rhinoplasty or facelift. The nonsurgical procedures include Botox and laser hair removal. In 2010, their survey revealed that there were 9,336,814 total procedures in the United States. Of those, 1,622,290 procedures were surgical. They also found that a large majority, 81%, of the procedures were done on Caucasian people. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) estimates that more than 333,000 cosmetic procedures were performed on patients 18 years of age or younger in the US in 2005 compared to approx. 14,000 in 1996. This is significant because it encourages younger people to continue these procedures later in life. The increased use of cosmetic procedures crosses ethnic plastic surgery in the U.S., with increases seen among African-Americans, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans as well as Caucasian Americans. In Europe, the second largest market for cosmetic procedures, cosmetic surgery is a $2.2 billion business. Of 1191 UK newspaper articles, 89% used the term 'plastic surgery' in the context of cosmetic surgery.",99cf5ef6c774aa57c03337faa8b83259,How many procedures which the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery keeps statistic for are nonsurgical?,15,2,nabert,39bf70385c8d964103aeaa54f39ab05b,"In percent, how many cosmetic procedures were performed on men in 2001?",12,88,naqanet,577f8238ae3162dd71a79d6e72fada56,How many cosmetic procedures were performed on people of a race other than Caucasian?,19,-65.0,nabert,086ca91de7990c9a485b2a9a2babba26,How many more people under the age of 18 had cosmetic procedures in 2005 than in 1996?,319000,-92,naqanet,1b784d07eaeac61b54fee0540ca0fe6b,How many of the procedures performed in 2010 were nonsurgical?,7714524,9336814,naqanet,4901844465a4cea4412e108e576c0d8f,How many percent of cosmetic procedures in 2014 were not performed on women?,8,80,naqanet,bee74bf0da9301e1696585b5a07ee0eb,Which of the most common procedures are not done on the breasts?,liposuction eyelid surgery abdominoplasty,"liposuction , breast reduction , eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty",nabert,bbaad671ed43871b91062d26f334a698,How many more than the top five procedures does the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for?,29,-34,naqanet,aa4efd0d8ea68fb12f8b845616752a5d,"In 2010, in percent, how many procedures were done on those not classified as Caucasian?",19,0,naqanet,d584726f89aaabc111928226a36d163a,How many of the five most common procedures are not done on the breasts?,3,76,naqanet,52364b090ce8549ec67331a1c893bbc1
"Danish officials appealed for help to French colonists at Martinique, located 324 miles away. Two French ships arrived from there to St. John on April 23, 1734, carrying several hundred French and Swiss troops to try to take control from the rebels. With their firepower and troops, by mid-May they had restored planters' rule of the island. The French ships returned to Martinique on June 1, leaving the local militia to track down the remaining rebels, which they did over the next three months. The slave insurrection was considered ended on August 25, 1734 when Sergeant Øttingen captured the remaining maroon rebels. The loss of life and property from the insurrection caused many St. John landowners to move to St. Croix, a nearby island bought by the Danish from the French in 1733. Four ships carried planters and their families from Charlotte Amalie in August. While they found St. Croix to be a richer land, they had to have their slaves clear jungle before being able to live there readily.",b2b8b400796f7f853edd0711ff3c55ac,What kind of people were on the ships that arrived at St. Croix in August?,planters and their families,planters,nabert,db2faf1242290d46498c7c8fb626303e,When did the event end that caused many St. John landowners to move to St. Croix?,August 25 1734,1733,naqanet,48bbdb30940c4d855472ebe070eecfb3,What kind of people were on the ships that arrived at St. Croix in August?,planters and their families,Danish officials appealed for help to French,naqanet,c84fb7b5f39d09cad6fddee87c8210bf,When did two french ships arrive at St. John?,April 23 1734,1734,naqanet,e8ffcedf1cebd7528c8835737d7030d0,How many days were the French troops away from Martinique?,38,24.0,nabert,864eee1349944d30319bc2df99901881,When did the event end that caused many St. John landowners to move to St. Croix?,August 25 1734,1734,nabert,f2e86c296f21a35df64ddc42a7c0777f,When did two french ships arrive at St. John?,April 23 1734,april,nabert,eb85d1042b81c0a545172b7f98e21dce,"Who did the Swiss allied with to capture St. John from the rebels control, the French or the Dutch?",French,Dutch,naqanet,4563d7d26ea6b8e3d31d9ea3b980203a,How many days were the French troops away from Martinique?,38,22,naqanet,8a6fd9f75b516c4bd9b6c65f34e9a64e,What day did two french ships arrive at St. John?,April 23,april,nabert,f5464f44ed236ceb1c33b86f03668ddb

"During the 1970s the oil shocks (1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis) hit Iceland hard. Inflation rose to 43% in 1974 and 59% in 1980, falling to 15% in 1987 but rising to 30% in 1988. Iceland experienced moderately strong GDP growth (3% on average) from 1995 to 2004. Growth slowed between 2000 and 2002, but the economy expanded by 4.3% in 2003 and grew by 6.2% in 2004. Growth in 2005 exceeded 6%. Inflation averaged merely 1.5% from 1993 to 1994, and only 1.7% from 1994 to 1995. Inflation over 2006 topped at 8.6%, with a rate of 6.9% as of January 2007. Standard & Poors reduced their rating for Iceland to AA- from A+ (long term) in December 2006, following a loosening of fiscal policy by the Icelandic government ahead of the 2007 elections. Foreign debt rose to more than five times the value of Icelands GDP, and Icelands Central Bank raised short-term interest rates to nearly 15% in 2007.

"Following World War II, Britain retained control of both British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland as protectorates. In 1950, as a result of the Paris Peace Treaties, the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition—first proposed by the Somali Youth League  and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali  and the Somali National League —that Somalia achieve independence within ten years. British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960. In 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis, the British returned the Haud  and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British, French and Italians agreed upon the territorial boundaries of Ethiopia with the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against raids by hostile clans. Britain included the provision that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over. Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District  to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic.",d199565a56b02e76c9b5cc8fe7895956,Which country's nationalists gained control of the Northern Frontier district?,Kenyan,Britain,naqanet,4546acf40a377b0dd96d7af85647106a,How many years after returning the Haud and the Ogaden to Ethiopia did the British try to buy them back?,8,-1897,naqanet,f43c9572542468e233a2b2850dd2c906,Which condition was set so that Italy had control of Somaliland?,independence within ten years,"italy trusteeship of italian somaliland , but only under close supervision",nabert,6a8eb80e3a36effd6a31ba2b10c5e941,Who decided on Ethiopian territorial boundaries?,"British, French and Italians",french and italians,nabert,903b996b4ed2129d0a50c01492eff5a7,In what year did Somaliland achieve independence?,1960,-10,naqanet,da024be4ac03c683c824b0ddd53fcc99,How many years did it take Somalia to achieve independence?,10,1950.0,nabert,1f2e2ae65714f6a4bfdfa75995ec2469,How many years after the British returned the Haud and the Ogaden to Ethiopia did British Somaliland remain a protectorate of Britain?,12,63,naqanet,22d630c1a9d1f6bdc0e3ff69ccfdde37,British returned the Haud and the Ogaden to Ethiopia how many before they tried to buy it back?,8,2,naqanet,f76d61a3a3f1aa59c54267bf57ddef2d,In what year did Somaliland achieve independence?,1960,1970.0,nabert,021d8e6066d9066a2286a2baa02e329b,Which Somali political organizations proposed the independence clause?,Somali Youth League Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali Somali National League,"Somali Youth League  and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali",naqanet,bd7efe77c15af0bc57e012cdbd022ceb
"Following a rare tie with the Minnesota Vikings 26-26 at Lambeau Field, the Packers travelled to Ford Field to take on the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving football. Due to Matt Flynn's performance the previous week, he replaces Scott Tolzien and makes his first start for the Packers in the 2013 season. The Lions' opening possession ended at the Green Bay 12 when Clay Matthews forced a Reggie Bush fumble that was recovered by Morgan Burnett. However, the Packers could not capitalize, and the Lions drew first blood with a 27-yard field goal. Following a kickoff that went out-of-bounds, the Packers answered with a 54-yard field goal to tie it at 3-3. The Packers quickly struck again when Nick Perry forced a Matthew Stafford fumble that was returned by Morgan Burnett for a TD for a 10-3 lead. The Lions answered by scoring two TDs, first a 5-yard TD pass to Jeremy Ross, then a 1-yard run by Reggie Bush. Detroit had opportunities for more points before the half, but David Akers missed a 31-yard field goal as the 1st half expired, keeping a 17-10 lead. Following a 3-and-out on Green Bay's opening possession in the 3rd quarter, the Lions scored on a 20-yard TD pass to Calvin Johnson, extending their lead 24-10. Late in the 3rd quarter, Ndamukong Suh sacked Matt Flynn in the endzone, forcing a safety that made it 26-10. The Lions capitalized on their next possession with a 1-yard run by Joique Bell.

"For the Fox, the origins, and the potential solution, to resolve their conflict lay in the slave trade. The Foxes were still willing to return to the French alliance if they could secure the return of their captives.:215 In fact, all they wanted was to be considered as allies and kin, not enemies. However, the French officials supported that the Illinois, Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Huron were against the Foxes. As a result, the peace treaty from 1726 was annulled in the summer of 1727.:215 With this peace treaty being annulled, the Fox declared war to the French and all their Indian allies. For the next four years, the French invested a lot of money and descended, with their allies, on Fox villages with an extreme advantage.:216 The French pursued destruction of the Fox to such an extent as to damage their relations with other tribes. The Sioux and the Iowas refused the Fox sanctuary.:218 By the summer of 1730, the Fox population was weakening and continued to be attacked until the Sauk finally granted them sanctuary. The Sauk and Fox fought off the French with the help of western Indians, who were aware of Beauharnois plan for decimation.:219 This final push would cause Beauharnois to grant a ""General Pardon"" in 1738 and peace to be restored.:219 Their historical feuds with New France encouraged many Sauk and Fox warriors to develop kinship ties with France's rivals, the British. These ties continued to be significant as late as the War of 1812, when many Sauk and Fox fought on the side of British North America.",eb8832bf238aa10251f7797938e88b8d,How many years after the peace treaty was annulled did the Sauk finally grant the Fox sanctuary?,3,4.0,nabert,ae97dcce9c316f89a31b5b76a9b9be32,How many years did the peace treaty in 1726 last before it was annulled 1727?,1,-1626.0,nabert,148ef63f86abd1b5f23553b514efdbf3,How many years after the Peace treaty from 176 began was it annulled?,1,0.0,nabert,134746722240159ba1c6d18f540fa707,how many year did the peace treaty last between fox and french ?,1,1726,naqanet,d04fb4da97e85f28371d6310dd3dcb1f,How many years after the peace treat was annulled was peace restored?,11,-1726,naqanet,a9aa2a80d9112688a0fe256a51c0c81e,Which tribes were against the Fox?,"Illinois, Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Huron",French,naqanet,9aacb32ad179f75c890b93cee13329d1,How many years after the peace treat was annulled was peace restored?,11,12.0,nabert,bece9596be0846820aca036bb75489bc,How many years after the Peace treaty from 176 began was it annulled?,1,-1726,naqanet,172efd2f3bf8d5df1688f1570a1ec0c4,How many years did the peace treaty in 1726 last before it was annulled 1727?,1,-1726,naqanet,affccba6781bfc866bcf8ceea6f6003e,How many tribes were against the Fox?,4,2,naqanet,84e8012c1f02e77e9fb750faffcd0568
"For the third straight week, the game got off to an ominous start for the Jets, as Chad Pennington was intercepted by Brian Williams on the Jets' first possession. Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run.

"From 1623 to 1624 the Dutch had been at war over the Pescadores, and in 1633 clashed with a fleet led by Zheng Zhilong in the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, ending in another Dutch defeat. By 1632 the Dutch had established a post on a peninsula named Tayoan , which was separated from the main part of Formosa by a shallow lagoon historically referred to as the Taikang inland sea . The Dutch fortifications consisted of two forts along the bay: the first and main fortification was the multiple-walled Fort Zeelandia, situated at the entrance to the bay, while the second was the smaller Fort Provintia, a walled administrative office. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan for the Dutch East India Company, was stationed in Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men, while his subordinate, Valentyn, was in charge of Fort Provintia and its garrison of 500 men. In 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, son of Zheng Zhilong and leader of the Ming loyalist remnants, felt that the Qing Empire had consolidated their position in China sufficiently, while his troops needed more supplies and manpower. He began searching for a suitable location as his base of operations, and soon a Chinese man named He Bin , who was working for the Dutch East India Company in Formosa , fled to Koxinga's base in Xiamen and provided him with a map of Taiwan.",be760e9942c1240c9a26a9ef2cf3eccb,How many years were the Dutch at war over the Pescadores?,2,1,naqanet,cafeeb0503339b5e13d277c921d53c2a,Which forts belonged to the Dutch?,Fort Zeelandia Fort Provintia,peninsula named Tayoan,naqanet,f0e558ac901d7d7925a387db34ccc269,Who was stationed at Fort Provintia?,Valentyn,Frederick Coyett,naqanet,6c214d1276f06669c34b9d18592cc9ce,Which among the two forts was the multiple- walled?,Fort Zeelandia,Fort Provintia,naqanet,e51b5fdc4952ff5fc3aa987bff76e874,Which forts belonged to the Dutch?,Fort Zeelandia Fort Provintia,zeelandia,nabert,e56c9b1598cff78dafba9daad24c5c31,In a span of how many years were the dutch at war  over the Pescadores?,2,1,naqanet,2fba578101a30a3ddd54678f41f22e69,Which fort was not at the entrance of the bay?,Fort Provintia,zeelandia,nabert,af3b8a1d90ef248ff3ee60f7eb80ed95,How many years passed between the beginning of the war over the Pescadores and the Battle of Liaoluo Bay?,10,1,naqanet,e03f54a6b8a0af24701dce5c0c07a0bf,"Which fort was larger, Provintia or Zeelandia?",Zeelandia,Provintia,naqanet,26ebb993b97dcc4f199e9dd6f94f46ba,How many years after the end of the war over the Pescadores did the Dutch participate in the Battle of Liaoluo Bay?,9,10,naqanet,a478153ba486fdc035c53f7899937b16
"From 1989 to 1993, the Pacers would play at or near .500 and qualify for the playoffs, in 1989-90 NBA season, the Pacers parlayed a fast start into the teams third playoff appearance. But the Pacers were swept by the 1989-90 Detroit Pistons season, who would go on to win their second consecutive 1990 NBA Finals. Reggie Miller became the first Pacer to play in the 1990 NBA All-Star Game since 1976 on the strength of his 24.6 points-per-game average. Despite four straight first round exits, this period was highlighted by a first round series with the Boston Celtics in 1990-91 NBA season that went to Game 5. The next season, the Pacers returned to the playoffs in 1992 NBA Playoffs and met the 1991-92 Boston Celtics season for the second year in a row. But this time, the Celtics left no doubt who was the better team, as they swept the Pacers in three straight games. Chuck Person and point guard Micheal Williams were traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the off-season, and the Pacers got Pooh Richardson and Sam Mitchell (basketball) in return. For the 1992-93 NBA season, Detlef Schrempf moved from sixth man to the starter at small forward and was elected to his first All-Star game. Miller, meanwhile, became the Pacers all-time NBA era leading scorer during this season (4th overall).

"From November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields. By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha in the Hunan province.",1992658f3bd97e70b7fb400889d5eeb7,"How many months after the Battle of Changde began did the Japanese launch an operation against Brtisih positions in Assam, India?",4,2,naqanet,9aacd52e44c4e991fc9ffd044eb877f7,"Which happened first in 1944, the allies attacking at Monte Cassino or the Soviets liberating Crimea?",allies attacking at Monte Cassino,at Monte Cassino,naqanet,15940f5bc2cca0672119079c745966d4,"How many months after the Battle of Changde began did the Japanese launch an operation against Brtisih positions in Assam, India?",4,3,nabert,6431023143f0f5170aa31396c269f205,How many months passed between the Battle of Changde and the Allied attack in Italy?,2,4,nabert,846ec27899e118e2177729f0cfa3c466,In what month did the Battle of Cahngde end?,December,1948.0,nabert,891c215dbb14f2e49a9e4ea18fe0b998,"What happened first, The German forces were expelled from the Leningrad region or the Japanese launched the first of two invasions?",German forces were expelled,expelled German forces,naqanet,09eb9b43078cc29f82c0d84393fe8e66,In what month did the Battle of Cahngde end?,December,November,naqanet,9a302f5f8c92c72bec604a9e66656ed8,"Which happened first in 1944, allies attacking at Monte Cassino or the British counteroffensive against the Japanese?",British counteroffensive against the Japanese,at Monte Cassino,naqanet,e9e1d5087d648555060aab978d9b7175,"Which happened first in 1944, the allies attacking at Monte Cassino or the Soviets liberating Crimea?",allies attacking at Monte Cassino,soviets had liberated crimea,nabert,702d6ed16286b2892c21baa47c83bec4,Who was responsible for ending the longest and most lethal siege in history?,Soviet,allies,nabert,bdda36478117cc436d26309e4b15b499

"In 1570 MacGill reluctantly accepted appointment as Provost of Edinburgh. In November 1571, during the War between Leith and Edinburgh when Mary's supporters held Edinburgh Castle, MacGill was sent with Robert Pitcairn, Commander of Dunfermline to negotiate with Henry, Lord Hunsdon at Berwick upon Tweed. MacGill was to ask for 8 cannons, 3000 footmen and pikemen, and support for 1000 Scots troops, in the cause of the ""maintenance and protection of the true religion to the confusion of those that now goes about to disturb the same"". MacGill had a particular interest in the siege as the ""registers and records of the chief matters"" were guarded by artillery at Edinburgh Castle, together with the Scottish Crown jewels. The forces holding Edinburgh Castle, known as the Castilians, in 1572 twice destroyed MacGill's stronghouses in Edinburgh, and while the siege lasted the Burgh Council met in exile at Leith. Regent Morton wrote to MacGill in 1575 asking him to re-negotiate a gold and silver mining contract with the Dutch engineer Cornelius de Vos. A portrait painter working in Scotland at this time, Arnold Bronckorst, was associated with Cornelius and Nicholas Hilliard. Morton also obtained passports for MacGill's sons, John and David, to travel to France to continue their studies. MacGill died on 16 October 1579. Alexander Hay succeeded him as Lord Clerk Register.

"In 1611 a Swedish expeditionary corps under Jacob De la Gardie captured Novgorod. The Novgorodians asked the Swedish king to install one of his sons — Carl Filip or Gustavus Adolphus — as their monarch. In the meantime, Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the Swedish throne. The young king decided to press his brother's claim to the Russian throne even after the Poles had been expelled from Moscow by a patriotic uprising of 1612 and Mikhail Romanov had been elected a new tsar. While the Swedish statesmen envisaged the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to Archangelsk and eastwards to Vologda, De la Gardie and other Swedish soldiers, still holding Novgorod and Ingria, saw the war as a reaction for their forces not receiving payment for their succour during the De la Gardie Campaign. In 1613 they advanced towards Tikhvin and laid a siege to the city, but were repelled. The Russian counter-offensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle and the war lumbered on until 1614, when the Swedes captured Gdov. The following year they laid siege to Pskov but Russian generals Morozov and Buturlin held their own until 27 February 1617, when the Treaty of Stolbovo stripped Russia of its access to the Baltic Sea and awarded to Sweden the province of Ingria with the townships of Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye and Noteborg. Novgorod and Gdov were to be restituted to Russia. As a result of the war, Russia was denied access to the Baltic sea for about a century, despite its persistent efforts to reverse the situation.

"In 1740, the Mon of Lower Burma revolted against the Toungoo Dynasty and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom based in Pegu . Throughout the 1740s, the Hanthawaddy forces were winning against Upper Burma-based Toungoo armies. The Siamese were concerned by another rising power in Burma since a strong Burma historically meant future invasions to Siam.  Concerned, the Siamese court readily gave protection to the Burmese governors of Martaban  and Tavoy who had fled to Siam. In 1745, they sent a diplomatic mission to Ava  to evaluate the political situation there, and were received by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi. They saw an Ava court that was on its last legs. By 1751, Restored Hanthawaddy forces were closing in on Ava. The Siamese concerns about the emergence of another strong dynasty based in Pegu appeared imminent. Perhaps as a precautionary measure, the Siamese decided to move their forward base into the upper coast in 1751.  While it remains unclear as to whether the Siamese ever intended  to go beyond the coast into mainland Lower Burma, the Siamese action nonetheless rang alarm bells in Pegu. Deeply concerned, the Hanthawaddy leadership withdrew two-thirds of their army back down to Lower Burma immediately after they had toppled the last Toungoo king in April 1752. This redeployment of Hanthawaddy troops proved a critical turning point in Burmese history as it gave nascent Upper Burmese resistance groups much needed breathing room. The Hanthawaddy command left less than 10,000 men to pacify all of Upper Burma.  Taking advantage of light Hanthawaddy troops, one resistance group, the Konbaung Dynasty led by Alaungpaya, drove out Hanthawaddy troops from Upper Burma by May 1754. Konbaung armies invaded Lower Burma in 1755, and captured Pegu in 1757, ending the 17-year-old Mon kingdom.",3a2e78b55228a6e1f224fb4262d5dcbe,Where were the Siamese recieved by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi?,Ava,"ava court that was on its last legs . by 1751 , restored hanthawaddy forces were closing in on ava",nabert,5d129084fd48cc106b1993596ce04f1f,How many years passed between the founding of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom and the invasion of Lower Burma?,15,12.0,nabert,67db523e61d73d438dc9378c687d2340,When did the Hanthawaddi withdraw most of their troops from Upper Burma?,May 1754,1754,naqanet,6eabc721468365196a62d3a4e725cb86,How many years did it take Alaungpaya and his dynasty to drive out Hanthawaddy troops from upper Burma after Hanthawaddy leadership had toppled the last Toungoo king?,2,-2,naqanet,32019cbb4145b4b5fd77e182eb67371c,Who sent a diplomatic mission to Ava in 1745?,the Siamese court,ese,nabert,9b1cae45312c6010552548e8f24adf27,Who sent a diplomatic mission to Ava in 1745?,the Siamese court,"Tavoy who had fled to Siam.

"In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants, which included 802 men and 231 women and children, departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico. The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of Mérida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905. These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigración Coreana a Yucatán, a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey.",2c338e4d80c0ef1b2ad8304db8be8a47,How many more Korean immigrants in 1905 that departed from Chemulpo were men than women or children?,571,201.0,nabert,384f89bf13bc9c441c93c72d805f73c2,"Were there more men or women and children who departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico?",men,women and children,naqanet,14dd5e93f34087cab1a743fad588dabc,Which port did the Korean immigrants leave first Chemulpo or Veracruz?,Veracruz,chemulpo,nabert,8b04d1df26393585ecbe4cf4e78a6230,Which town was a popular destination for the Korean immigrants?,"The town of Motul, Yucatan",motul,nabert,68587d5bca55a50f3b2e1cf38338af61,Which population groups consisted of less members than the male population?,women and children,Korean immigrants,naqanet,6f530befd12ca48abc320e51ba67c805,Were there more men or women and children immigrants present?,men,women and children,naqanet,535735acad2310fb6e2a8613964173d6,What did the latest immigrants do to rememeber past immigrants?,a museum for the remembrance,marriages,nabert,26925f818c1d28a81f9541714a12bfa0,Which port did the Korean immigrants leave later Chemulpo or Veracruz?,Chemulpo,Veracruz,naqanet,a68b9291df5088eb8db7d176aa490aaf,Which town was a popular destination for the Korean immigrants?,"The town of Motul, Yucatan",Yucatan,naqanet,f7e9669e7db60ed4ecde2d71c12972e0,How many years did the immigrants have to work as indentured laborers?,4,3,nabert,f9645d93082dc9dc281644b409d83d4f

"In 1995, the Steelers overcame a 3-4 start (including a 20-16 upset loss to the expansion 1995 Jacksonville Jaguars season) to win eight of their final nine games and finished with an  record, the second-best in the AFC. Their offense was led by quarterback Neil ODonnell, who completed 246 out of 416 passes for 2,970 yards and 17 touchdowns, with only seven interceptions. Pro Bowl wide receiver Yancey Thigpen was the teams leading receiver with 85 receptions for 1,307 yards and five touchdowns. Other contributors in the passing game included wide receivers Andre Hastings (48 catches for 502 yards and one touchdown) and Ernie Mills (39 receptions for 679 yards and 8 touchdowns), who both also excelled as returners on special teams. Mills gained 1,306 yards returning kickoffs, while Hastings returned 48 punts for 474 yards and a touchdown.

"In 2004 Philadelphia Eagles season, the Philadelphia Eagles had their best season since 1960, going 13-1 before resting their starters and losing their next 2, clinching the number one seed for the second year in a row. McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didnt play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, Terrell Owens, who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After defeating the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons, the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the 2004 New England Patriots season. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14-14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate.

"In County Wexford, 100-200 Volunteers—led by Robert Brennan, Séamus Doyle and Seán Etchingham—took over the town of Enniscorthy on Thursday 27 April until Sunday. Volunteer officer Paul Galligan had cycled 200 km from rebel headquarters in Dublin with orders to mobilise. They blocked all roads into the town and made a brief attack on the RIC barracks, but chose to blockade it rather than attempt to capture it. They flew the tricolour over the Athenaeum building, which they had made their headquarters, and paraded uniformed in the streets. They also occupied Vinegar Hill, where the United Irishmen had made a last stand in the 1798 rebellion. The public largely supported the rebels and many local men offered to join them. By Saturday, up to 1,000 rebels had been mobilised, and a detachment was sent to occupy the nearby village of Ferns. In Wexford, the British assembled a column of 1,000 soldiers , two field guns and a 4.7 inch naval gun on a makeshift armoured train. On Sunday, the British sent messengers to Enniscorthy, informing the rebels of Pearse's surrender order. However, the Volunteer officers were skeptical.

"In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over Bessarabia as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany.

"In May, the first movements of the war started as a Danish fleet under Jakob Brockenhuus sailed towards the Baltic. At Bornholm, on 30 May 1563, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat.

"In October 1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara's Flare and Sharp's Extended Vector Animation formats.

Macromedia also hired Middlesoft to create a freely available developers' kit for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5. Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a non-disclosure agreement, but they are widely available from various sites. In April 2006, the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format .

"In early 1765, a 20,000-strong Burmese army stationed at Kengtung, led by Gen. Ne Myo Thihapate, left Kengtung for yet another Burmese invasion of Siam. With the main Burmese army gone, Liu used a few minor trade disputes between local Chinese and Burmese merchants as the excuse to order an invasion of Kengtung in December 1765. The invasion force, which consisted of 3,500 Green Standard troops along with Tai-Shan militias, laid siege to Kengtung but could not match battle-hardened Burmese troops at the Kengtung garrison, led by Gen. Ne Myo Sithu. The Burmese lifted the siege and pursued the invaders into Pu'er Prefecture, and defeated them there. Ne Myo Sithu left a reinforced garrison, and returned to Ava in April 1766. Governor Liu, in his embarrassment, first tried to conceal what had happened. When the emperor became suspicious, he ordered Liu's immediate recall and demotion. Instead of complying, Liu committed suicide by slicing his throat with a stationery knife, writing as blood was pouring from his neck: ""There is no way to pay back the emperor's favor. I deserve death with my crime"". While this kind of suicide in the face of bureaucratic failure apparently was not unusual in Qing China, it reportedly enraged the Emperor nonetheless. Sorting out the Mien  was now a matter of imperial prestige.

"In response to a border proposal by Sir John Oliver Wardrop—British Chief Commissioner in the South Caucasus—that would have assigned Nakhchivan to Armenia, Azeris of Nakhchivan revolted under the leadership of local landowner Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski in December 1918 and declared the independent Republic of Aras, with its capital in Nakhchivan. The republic, which was essentially subordinate to Azerbaijan, continued to exist until May 1919, when Armenian troops led by Drastamat Kanayan advanced into it to gain control over the region. They managed to capture the city of Nakhchivan in June 1919 and destroy the Republic of Aras, but afterwards fought combined regular Azeri and Ottoman troops, which reinstated Azeri control over the city in July.

"In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković.

"Instead, the Allies spent 1702 and 1703 taking towns such as Venlo and Roermond in the modern Dutch province of Limburg, as well as Liège, Bonn and Huy. Failure to take Antwerp in May 1703 ended hopes of a quick victory while a Dutch army under Slangenburg was surrounded by a French force several times their size at Ekeren on 30 June and only just escaped. Recriminations were considerable, with Slangenburg blaming his commander Obdam but also Marlborough and Van Coehoorn for failing to support him. Van Coehoorn was a difficult character with few friends while William's death in March 1702 deprived him of his most powerful sponsor and much of his influence. The campaigns of 1702 and 1703 showed his limitations as a field officer and led to criticism from both Marlborough and Dutch colleagues. In early 1704, he spoke with the Envoy of Savoy about possible opportunities in their army but died on 17 March in The Hague attending a conference with Marlborough.

"Led by former Giant Kurt Warner, the defending NFC champions took the field at Giants Stadium against a Giants team still reeling from their bad loss in New Orleans. The Giants scored first, sending Jacobs in for a 4-yard touchdown run following a Terrell Thomas interception. Later, Arizona running back Beanie Wells scored his first career touchdown on a 13-yard rush. Manning responded by throwing a 62-yard touchdown to Nicks for his longest reception of the year. In the second half, the Cardinals' Tim Hightower and Jason Wright scored touchdowns. But it was turnovers that decided this game; Manning's 3 interceptions were as many as he had thrown all season. The Giants scored only 3 points in the second half, ending the game on an interception to Antrel Rolle. The Giants notable streak of 38 consecutive starts by the same offensive line unit was ended here, as offensive tackle Kareem McKenzie missed the game with a groin injury.

"Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing sub-replacement fertility; its estimated total fertility rate of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999. As a result, its population has gradually declining and rapidly aging. In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs.

"Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing sub-replacement fertility; its estimated total fertility rate of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999.

In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs.

"More than 5,000 US troops of General John J. Pershing's forces, including elements of the 7th Cavalry and the African-American U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment, entered Mexico in hot pursuit of Villa. The campaign consisted primarily of dozens of minor skirmishes with small bands of insurgents. Gen. Pershing failed to catch up to Villa. On 21 June 1916, two troops of the 10th, totaling 92 troopers, attacked Mexican Federal Army troops in an engagement in the Battle of Carrizal, Chihuahua. 12 US troops were killed and 23 taken prisoner; 45 Federales were casualties, including the Mexican general Gomez. The engagement nearly precipitated open war with the Mexican government , but both governments immediately moved to lessen tensions and open negotiations for US withdrawal, preventing war.

"On 10 September 1580, 600 Papal troops  commanded by Sebastiano di San Giuseppe , landed in Smerwick, near the same point where Fitzmaurice had landed the previous year. They had been paid for and sent by Pope Gregory to aid the rebellion. Desmond, Baltinglass and John of Desmond made an effort to link up with the expeditionary force but English forces under Ormonde and Grey blocked them and prompt naval action by Richard Bingham blockaded the Papal force's ships into the bay at Smerwick. San Giuseppe had no choice but to fortify his men in the fort at Dún an Óir. In October 1580, Grey de Wilton with up to 4000 troops arrived at Smerwick and laid siege to the garrison. The invasion forces were geographically isolated on the tip of the narrow Dingle Peninsula, cut off by Mount Brandon on one side and the much larger English force on the other. They had no means of escape. In addition, the English had brought up heavy artillery by sea, which rapidly broke down the improvised defences of Dún an Óir. After a three-day siege, commander Di san Giuseppe surrendered on 10 October 1580. Grey de Wilton ordered the massacre of the invasion forces, sparing only the commanders. Italian and Spanish troops, and Irish men and women, were beheaded and their bodies thrown into the sea. Among the English soldiers present at the siege and massacre was the writer and explorer Walter Raleigh. This was brought against him as a criminal charge in one of his trials. Raleigh argued that he was ""obliged to obey the commands of his superior officer"" but he was unable to exonerate himself.",ebb598848c61246a099f68ae70dc9820,How many months after 600 Papal troops landed in Smerwich did Grey de Wilton arrive with 4000 troops?,1,2,naqanet,e5c2ee4e0ee18a88c774ba0003d4087e,How many days after Sebastiano di San Giuseppe landed in Smerwick did he surrender?,30,0,naqanet,f4596edf6c2c6fe37ef96ebe8faf021d,How many months into the year of 1580 did commander Di san Giuseppe surrender?,10,3,nabert,502622de0b38bdb576f2636fd75dbfd0,"Which happened first, Di san Giuseppe surrendering or the landing in Smerwick?",landing in Smerwick,di San Giuseppe,naqanet,dfa6753fa84b15337f8d66bbd7c8142b,Which two men landed in Smerwick?,Sebastiano di San Giuseppe Fitzmaurice,Papal troops,naqanet,c2041dab515fc366ab530bea23e0fe9f,On what day did the seige again the troops led by di San Giuseppe which would lead to his surrender begin?,October 7 1580,october,nabert,af8bc114a515af2e1cb725420edb6e60,"Who arrived in Smerwick first, Grey de Wilton or Papal troops?",Papal troops,Grey de Wilton,naqanet,c4ce7e3a4ab583612f5e8c92151d4c69,On what day did the seige again the troops led by di San Giuseppe which would lead to his surrender begin?,October 7 1580,1580,naqanet,890296c2fec8bfd8e3fda8b6dd9ef5eb,"Which happened first, Di san Giuseppe surrendering or the landing in Smerwick?",landing in Smerwick,landed in smerwick,nabert,0181901c9a1a5e8704de4cf694de5262,Which two men landed in Smerwick?,Sebastiano di San Giuseppe Fitzmaurice,sebastiano di san giuseppe,nabert,8e260571ed38d2c180a4db079f5153dd
"On 12 November , a Constituent Assembly was elected. In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets. On 16 December 1917 , the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated. On 20 December 1917 , the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents.

"On 12 November , a Constituent Assembly was elected. In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets. On 16 December 1917 , the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated. On 20 December 1917 , the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents.

"On 16 February 1525, 25 villages belonging to the city of Memmingen rebelled, demanding of the magistrates  improvements in their economic condition and the general political situation. They complained of peonage, land use, easements on the woods and the commons as well as ecclesiastical requirements of service and payment. The city set up a committee of villagers to discuss their issues, expecting to see a checklist of specific and trivial demands. Unexpectedly, the peasants delivered a uniform declaration that struck at the pillars of the peasant-magisterial relationship. Twelve articles clearly and consistently outlined their grievances. The council rejected many of the demands. Historians have generally concluded that the articles of Memmingen became the basis for the Twelve Articles agreed on by the Upper Swabian Peasants Confederation of 20 March 1525. A single Swabian contingent, close to 200 horse and 1,000 foot soldiers, however, could not deal with the size of the disturbance.

"On 19 June 2015, Oshkosh Defense announced the U.S. Army had awarded the company a five-year requirements contract worth a potential $780 million to Recapitalize (Recap) its Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (FHTV). The FHTV 4 contract covers an estimated 1,800 FHTVs and in addition to HEMTTs covers PLS trucks and also includes the production of approximately 1,000 new production PLS trailers.

"On 2 April, 2014, a kidnap gang believed to originate from Abu Sayyaf militants raided Singamata Reef Resort off Semporna. Chinese tourist Gao Huayun from Shanghai and Filipino resort worker Marcy Dayawan were abducted and taken to the Sulu Archipelago. The two hostages were later rescued after a collaboration between Malaysian and Philippines security forces. On 6 May, five Abu Sayyaf gunmen raided a Malaysian fish farm on Baik Island Sabah, kidnapped the fish farm manager and took him to Jolo island.

"On 26 October 1591, the Portuguese, led by André Furtado, mounted a military campaign against the Jaffna kingdom from Mannar. The forces consisted of 1,400 Portuguese soldiers and 3,000 Lascarins, who sailed with 43 ships and more than 200 small vessels. Jaffna forces were expecting the arrival in Kayts, but the fleet landed in Colombuthurai. With the support of heavy firepower, the first wave of 150 Portuguese soldiers and 200 Lascarins reached land. The first-wave attack favoured the Portuguese, who managed to kill the enemy soldiers and captured two pieces of artillery, more than 300 muskets, various other weapons, and ammunition. The second wave, comprising 400 Portuguese soldiers, reached land, followed by the rest of the soldiers, who captured a storehouse and stationed at night. The next day, the Portuguese forces marched toward the capital and faced a defensive attack led by Prince Gago, son-in-law of Puvirasa Pandaram. Gago was killed in action and his entire company was wiped out. Advancing forces faced another ferocious defensive attack between the Nallur Kandaswamy temple and the Nallur Weerakaliyamman temple. Prince Ethirimana Cinkam was wounded and was about to be executed by the invading forces, but was saved by a captain, Simão Pinhão. The Portuguese army captured the king when he tried to escape into a temple. André Furtado ordered the king's execution by beheading. His head was then placed on a pike and kept on display for several days. The palace was sacked and the king's entire family was taken captive. Eight hundred Badagas and some Moors of Kozhikode were beheaded, as they were considered enemies. All the vessels in the port were burnt except two vessels for the use of the king. Three ships, 100 Portuguese soldiers, and 200 Lascarins were stationed in Jaffna at the request of the new king.",6f612a0f5bfc2dc2f2b75e8cea1b4e3a,At least how many ships did Furtado sail with?,43,243,naqanet,0d99b7e11546efd5acaf717bad80dcc6,"Which event happened first, the military campaign against the Jaffna, or the death of Gago?",military campaign against the Jaffna,military campaign against the jaffna kingdom,nabert,d33d2d82b66c54f5bc5c70df5a9ff504,"Which wave had fewer soldiers total, the first or second?",first wave,second,naqanet,d9ff60c38ebe9aa5adadebaaab2c1a3a,How many total men fought for the Portuguese?,1400,1550,naqanet,3c1ce6bcce39412d5d916aff3d69ef1f,How many soldiers were in the first wave to reach land?,350,550.0,nabert,1da4cad2b436194eee692f7ab161cf5a,About how many soldiers did the military campaign start with?,4400,1500.0,nabert,8728f240d7f4232e5b46443d9254b90a,How many total soldiers were led by Andre Furtado?,4400,1800,naqanet,2219076e8692cfa50b6d0c33e0d9736f,About how many soldiers did the military campaign start with?,4400,1400,naqanet,c7a289f5843a1c41e54b1eec950f9c22,How many total men fought for the Portuguese?,1400,1500.0,nabert,cda1ae520f1b50db313b450e0725c887,How many total soldiers were led by Andre Furtado?,4400,1500.0,nabert,40a7173543edc8d1fdae5ffa7beafb6b
"On 31 December 1543, Henry and Charles had signed a treaty pledging to invade France in person by 20 June 1544; each was to provide an army of no less than 35,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry for the venture. Against this Francis could muster about 70,000 men in his various armies. The campaign could not begin, however, until Henry and Charles had resolved their personal conflicts with Scotland and the German princes, respectively. On 15 May, Henry was informed by Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, that, after his raids, Scotland was no longer in a position to threaten him; he then began to make preparations for a personal campaign in France—against the advice of his council and the Emperor, who believed that his presence would be a hindrance. Charles had meanwhile reached an understanding with the princes at the Diet of Speyer, and the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg had agreed to join his invasion of France. By May 1544, two Imperial armies were poised to invade France: one, under Ferrante Gonzaga, Viceroy of Sicily, north of Luxemburg; the other, under Charles himself, in the Palatinate. Charles had gathered a combined force of more than 42,000 for the invasion, and had arranged for another 4,000 men to join the English army.

"On 7-8 October at the Battle of Slobodyshche 14,000-15,000 Poles and 5,000-6,000 Tatars defeated the Cossacks under Yurii Khmelnytsky, who was trying to link up with Sheremetev. After the unsuccessful battle Yurii began talks with the Poles.

"One week later, Dallas faced the 1993 San Francisco 49ers season in the NFC Championship Game for the second year in a row in what was, at the time, the last NFL game to air on CBS.  The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys.  The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.  But this time, the game was extremely one-sided.  The Cowboys scored touchdowns on four of their five first-half possessions.  By the end of the half, Dallas had a commanding 28-7 lead.  Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes for 177 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, while also rushing for 25 yards, but was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter.  Then San Francisco scored a touchdown, making the score 28-14 with plenty of time left for a comeback.  However, their hopes were soon dashed as backup quarterback Bernie Kosar, who had already played in three conference championship games and was unable to advance to the Super Bowl each time, led the Cowboys 82 yards to go up 35-14 on his 42-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Harper.  Murray then put the finishing touches on San Francisco with a 50-yard field goal, while all the 49ers could do was score a useless touchdown in ""garbage time"" to make the final score 38-21.  Smith rushed for 88 yards, caught seven passes for 85 yards, and scored two touchdowns.  Meanwhile, the Dallas defense held 49ers running back Ricky Watters, who rushed for over 100 yards and scored 5 touchdowns in the divisional round, to just 37 yards on 12 carries.",8580ced1d2ffee1886378f18a94d29f3,Who were all the Dallas quarterbacks who played in the 1993 NFC Championship Game?,Aikman Bernie Kosar,"aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter . but this time , the game was extremely one - sided . the cowboys scored touchdowns on four of their five first - half possessions . by the end of the half , dallas had a commanding 28 - 7 lead . aikman completed 14 of 18 passes for 177 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions , while also rushing for 25 yards , but was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter . then san francisco scored a touchdown , making the score 28 - 14 with plenty of time left for a comeback . however , their hopes were soon dashed as backup quarterback bernie kosar",nabert,73f1f36c0a9d00a42738f0f7f2ca2d9d,How many points did the Cowboys offense score total prior to this game?,376,0,naqanet,d0c73c779505e1ecfc6afb3eb3ef38f8,"Who started the game at quarterback for the Cowboys, Aikmen or Kosar?",Aikman was knocked out of the game with a concussion backup quarterback Bernie Kosar,Aikmen,naqanet,34960994fccd0e36ba6761bfab68f7d7,Who were all the Dallas quarterbacks who played in the 1993 NFC Championship Game?,Aikman Bernie Kosar,Bernie Kosar,naqanet,508176aa482cf144c6cba22e16cb2a0d,How many points did the Cowboys offense score total prior to this game?,376,570.0,nabert,f76fddfcccb9aba8fa5454630b75f81d,"Who scored first in the second half of the game, Cowboys or 49ers?",49ers,cowboys,nabert,c93d51322ca9722e0ae7d9ab1468803b,Did the 49ers score more points in the first half or the second half?,the second half,first half,naqanet,7a48b8be85b1a6fa77f48bb5cf298048,"Who started the game at quarterback for the Cowboys, Aikmen or Kosar?",Aikman was knocked out of the game with a concussion backup quarterback Bernie Kosar,kosar,nabert,518c1b629159b0ec9df26591e60df437,"Which NFL team lost the game, 49ers or Cowboys?",49ers,Cowboys,naqanet,06059ef9080ee3a55c1a1a722c026835,How many more rushing yards did Smith have compared to Watters?,51,-12.0,nabert,6d9f1ddfe4b7b4057b3e84c2f39b0845

"Paraguay has a small tourism industry. Total tourism receipts declined annually from 2000 through 2002. In 2003 Paraguay's hotel occupancy rate was 38 percent. It increased by 15 percent in 2004. Small gains in tourism have come from business rather than leisure travellers. For many years, Paraguay served as a central market for trafficable, duty-free goods. However, crackdowns by the governments of Brazil and Argentina have stemmed the flow of shoppers travelling to Paraguay looking for trafficable items. Paraguay is a country that has a lot of different activities for tourism, due to privileged weather and location conditions condensed into a varied geography, an inviting ""warm"" tropical climate and an  interesting history and unmatched folk art that adorn its streets with an identity that enchants anyone who visits the country. As an example, for less than 80 US dollars a visitor can have a personalized trip to a nature reserve area called Eco-Reserva Mbatovi which is located in the Paraguari department, about an hour away from the capital.

"Peele was christened on 25 July 1556 at St James Garlickhythe in the City of London. His father, James Peele (d. Dec 30, 1585), who appears to have belonged to a Devonshire family, was clerk of Christs Hospital, a school which was then situated in central London, and wrote two treatises on bookkeeping, The Maner and Fourme How to Kepe a Perfecte Reconyng (1553) and The Pathe Waye to Perfectnes (1569). The latter depicts James Peele in a woodcut on the title page. No contemporary likeness of George is known, although he was said to be short-legged, dark complected, red haired, and squinting, although not necessarily from reliable sources. Georges mother, Anne, died July 1, 1580, and his father married Christian Widers (d. 1597 in St. Christopher le Stocks) on November 3, 1580. She became a nurse on the Hospital payroll, where she remained five years after James Peeles death, when she married Ralph Boswell. His siblings included Anne (d. Jan 10, 1568/9),  Isabel, Judith (d. Apr. 16, 1582), and James (b. Jan 3, 1563/4).  Anne married John Alford on May 14, 1565, and had one son, Robert (October 9, 1567- c. March 12, 1654/5). Judith married John Jackman on June 19, 1575, and had three children, Susan (b. June 3, 1576), William (April 30, 1577-July 1, 1577), and Sarah (d. May 24, 1578). On Feb. 5, 1568/9, Isabel married Mathew Shakespeare, with whom she had eight children.  Many scholars believe that this was a cousin of William Shakespeare, but this has not been verified. James Peele also wrote the Ironmongers Pageants of 1566 and 1569, which may have led to Georges writing of two Lord Mayors pageants.",7cede967d243adbe5cdfd23976444f0c,Who was James Peele's son?,George,James Garlickhythe,naqanet,ac03ddb3357d0cd97cc61f744b0e0ea5,How many months after the death of his wife Anne did James marry Christian Widers?,4,7,nabert,4fe5f12bc234ab7c473b5498ba240418,How many years after Anne's marriage to John Alford was their son Robert born?,2,17.0,nabert,fffe9e048054a6ba80a6a16d0300c4e9,In what year did Christian Widers marry Ralph Boswell?,1590,1575.0,nabert,1f6690803941763591419540dc99f61b,Who was James Peele's son?,George,robert,nabert,6fa35a9ea8675da7d7e9ab1e384f5604,In what year did Christian Widers marry Ralph Boswell?,1590,1580,naqanet,235045e7fbe2ed896c243a6020ec9388,How many years after her marriage to Ralph Boswell did Christian Widers die?,7,17,naqanet,cf8614314ab4da213bb77bca01894773,Who was Anne's son?,George,Christian Widers,naqanet,b5251f4d4a93ae249f34732e1e85ee6d,How many years after her marriage to James Peele did Christian Widers die?,17,41,naqanet,99d854ee79a1b10c779fae20b5133cef,How many years after Anne's marriage to John Alford was their son Robert born?,2,-1565,naqanet,707342fcc8fab02c68ec22266dc2a9e3

"Polin succeeded ambassador Antoine de Rincon  in Constantinople. In early 1542, Polin successfully negotiated the details of a Franco-Ottoman alliance for the Italian War of 1542-1546, with the Ottoman Empire promising to send 27,500 troops against the territories of the Spanish king Ferdinand, as well as 110 galleys against Charles, while France promised to attack Flanders, harass the coasts of Spain with a naval force, and send 40 galleys to assist the Turks for operations in the Levant. Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543. In July 1543, Polin sailed on board the Ottoman fleet of Barbarossa to the Île Saint-Honorat in the Lérins Islands off Cannes on 5 July 1543, only to find very little ready for the offensive on the French side. Polin went to see king Francis I of France to obtain troops, which led to the Siege of Nice in August 1543.

"Refusing the title of king, Mirwais was called ""Prince of Qandahár and General of the national troops"" by his Afghan countrymen. He died peacefully in November 1715 from natural causes and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz; the latter was murdered later by Mirwais' son Mahmud. In 1720, Mahmud's Afghan forces crossed the deserts of Sistan and captured Kerman. His plan was to conquer the Persian capital, Isfahan. After defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Gulnabad on March 8, 1722, he proceeded to and besieged Isfahan for 6 months, after which it fell. On October 23, 1722, Sultan Husayn abdicated and acknowledged Mahmud as the new Shah of Persia. The majority of the Persian people, however, rejected the Afghan regime as usurpers from the start. For the next seven years until 1729, the Hotaks were the de facto rulers of most of Persia, and the southern and eastern areas of Afghanistan still remained under their control until 1738. The Hotak dynasty was a troubled and violent one from the very start as internecine conflict made it difficult to establish permanent control. The dynasty lived under great turmoil due to bloody succession feuds that made their hold on power tenuous, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan - including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family - the Hotak dynasty was eventually removed from power in Persia. On the other hand, the Afghans had also been suppressed by the Iranian Safavid government represented by its governor Gurgin Khan before their uprising in 1709.",f149b5e88bc591adb9fa72fd07cb92e0,Who took over for Mirwais,Abdul Aziz,Sultan Husayn,naqanet,30401a0b2d37268f8a5ac5c39a800fec,How many years did the Hotaks rule,7,1729,naqanet,93fff049a0115c9527e1f6dd22b9e21f,How did Abdul Aziz die?,murdered,from natural causes,nabert,4d7ae812b58c76a0981c536e350a5586,What did Mirwais die of?,natural causes,Refusing,naqanet,575033ca4855f0204309297a48b610e1,"Who gained control of the Persian throne on October 23rd, 1722?",Mahmud,Sultan Husayn,naqanet,313f83985a65d6345f19d22d09b178f8,What two major events occurred in 1722 in Afghanistan?,Battle of Gulnabad Sultan Husayn abdicated,besieged Isfahan,naqanet,34f1f6fac0acff97a2f7015b8eb16a91,How did Abdul Aziz die?,murdered,brother,naqanet,c7352610ebfaf6247f80cbe9eab5dde2,What two major events occurred in 1722 in Afghanistan?,Battle of Gulnabad Sultan Husayn abdicated,"october 23 , 1722 , sultan husayn abdicated and acknowledged mahmud as the new shah of persia",nabert,c16a283e2940e8d21c8145b83ce92c80,What year did the the Hotaks the de facto rulers of most of Persia?,1722,-7,naqanet,89ec37c7476f66be8f9c98b898d9cc19,How many years did the Hotaks rule,7,9.0,nabert,deeb10c7d63389b5d53aa518803eb66a
"Russia admitted that three of its Su-25 strike aircraft and one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber were lost. Georgia at that time claimed it had downed at least 21 Russian aircraft. Moscow Defence Brief provided a higher estimate for air force losses, saying that Russian Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, one Su-24M Fencer fighter-bomber, one Su-24MR Fencer E reconnaissance plane and four Su-25 attack planes. Anton Lavrov listed one Su-25SM, two Su-25BM, two Su-24M and one Tu-22M3 lost. Two helicopters, a Mi-8MTKO and a Mi-24, were wrecked in an accident after the hostilities. While there are no official figures, Russian ground equipment losses in the war are estimated to be three tanks, at least 20 armoured and 32 non-armoured vehicles lost in combat. Several more vehicles were impaired in accidents. During one engagement, Georgian forces destroyed 25 out of 30 vehicles of a Russian military unit commanded by General Anatoly Khrulyov. The Russian military had no losses in the artillery, air defence and naval forces. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, the five-day war cost Russia an estimated 12.5 billion rubles, a daily cost of 2.5 billion rubles.

"Salks vaccine was then used in a test called the Francis Field Trial, led by Thomas Francis, Jr., the largest medical experiment in history at that time. The test began with about 4,000 children at Franklin Sherman Elementary School in McLean, Virginia, and eventually involved 1.8 million children, in 44 states from Maine to California. By the conclusion of the study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections of the vaccine, about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group, who would then be observed to see if any contracted polio. The results of the field trial were announced 12 April 1955 (the tenth anniversary of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose Franklin D. Roosevelts paralytic illness was generally believed to have been caused by polio). The Salk vaccine had been 60-70% effective against PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% effective against PV2 and PV3, and 94% effective against the development of bulbar polio. Soon after Salks vaccine was licensed in 1955, childrens vaccination campaigns were launched. In the U.S, following a mass immunization campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 by 1957.

"Shang Zhixin was forced to commit suicide in 1680; of his thirty six brothers four were executed when he committed suicide while the rest of his family was allowed to live. Geng Jingzhong was executed; his brother Geng Juzhong 耿聚忠 was in Beijing with the Qing court with the Kangxi Emperor during the rebellion and was not punished for his brother's revolt. Geng Juzhong died of natural causes in 1687. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan , son of Zhu Yihai. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. In 1685, the Qing used former Ming loyalist Han Chinese naval specialists who had served under the Zheng family in Taiwan in the siege of Albazin. Former Ming loyalist Han Chinese troops who had served under Zheng Chenggong and who specialized at fighting with rattan shields and swords  藤牌营 were recommended to the Kangxi Emperor to reinforce Albazin against the Russians. Kangxi was impressed by a demonstration of their techniques and ordered 500 of them to defend Albazin, under Ho Yu, a former Koxinga follower, and Lin Hsing-chu, a former General of Wu Sangui. These rattan shield troops did not suffer a single casualty when they defeated and cut down Russian forces traveling by rafts on the river, only using the rattan shields and swords while fighting naked.",1c72ff09b6c1fe5212000b34e3a915a7,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were allowed to live?,32,26.0,nabert,09c8b11003fb69f74080d09bab919f26,Who were the troops ordered to defend Albazin?,Ho Yu Lin Hsing-chu,"Ho Yu, a former Koxinga follower, and Lin Hsing-chu",naqanet,951ee9c7f8d904f4b734d9505d6fb7ef,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were not executed?,32,2,naqanet,5e453c1b228238207ebc3e70d3ac3e57,Who were the troops ordered to defend Albazin?,Ho Yu Lin Hsing-chu,lin hsing - chu,nabert,a18d2c6d44dfa247d9fe7908d21834e9,How many brothers died?,4,6,naqanet,06ac30ecdf6bc502a9d696604fd7aff7,Who was the enemy of Ho Yu and Lin Hsing-chu?,Russians,Wu Sangui,naqanet,43d7531a6dfd3eb114c40af92a880c7b,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were NOT executed when he committed suicide?,32,2,naqanet,af0c68ea4a0c80d63ae7435a797b86ce,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were allowed to live?,32,2,naqanet,4009d7650a414e6cf18cda834296e804,How many of Shang Zhixin's brothers were not executed?,32,3,nabert,d0b7e9e8d56eabe461032af1e381c7dc,"Who had been the former general of Wu Sangui, Zheng Chenggong or Lin Hsing-chu?",Lin Hsing-chu,Zheng Chenggong,naqanet,260607e67bca1fa5d9bfa30da8024eee
"Since 1912 the Royal Danish Navy has operated aircraft either as a functional part of the navy or as flights conducted by the Royal Danish Air Force. Aviation pioneer Robert Svendsen purchased the first aircraft, a Henry Farman, and gave it to the navy who subsequently named it Glenten . Later the same year, a private funding effort made it possible to purchase two Donnet-Leveque flying boats named Maagen  and Ternen . At the outbreak of World War One the navy had two operational flying boats and five educated pilots making it possible to make daily reconnaissance flights over the Sound, monitoring German mine-laying activities. From 1914 to 1917, the Orlogsværftet  produced eight OV-flying boats and in 1915 and 1916 two naval flying stations were established in Copenhagen and Nyborg, mainly focusing on the two international seaways Øresund and Storebælt. After the war the Danish production of aircraft was stopped due to several crashes and an international surplus of warplanes. Following British advice, five Avro 504 were purchased for training purposes and based in Ringsted between the two important straits.",a363caa5906ca04ae1861eaaeee2c9dc,Did the Orlogsværftet produce more OV-flying boats or establish more naval flying stations?,produce more OV-flying boats,OV-flying boats,naqanet,64565fe14a5d73e7b4718fdfce44dfc5,How many planes did the Royal Danish Navy acquire the first year?,3,1,nabert,87e7677a3ac8ec97bc0d6e7934c2218d,Did the Royal Danish Navy have more operational flying boats or educated pilots at the outbreak of World War One?,educated pilots,operational flying boats,naqanet,9ce65fd77c6be89fb2ec71d603155ae9,How many flying stations were established in Copenhagen?,1,2,nabert,255bfcbf52a1b5779ed51e9ac0de1f8b,How many years did it take to establish flying stations in Copenhagen and Nyborg?,1,2,nabert,5f0e3b7cf3e615070dc2a9c45d4ed27d,How many years after the Orlogsværftet produce began production on OV-flying boats was a naval flying station established in Copenhagen?,1,1918,naqanet,a3b289c852e62bbe943417106ad61140,How many flying stations were established in Nyborg?,1,3,naqanet,dd2caa11eaceb07d33151330e8811d1a,"Which happened earlier, the purchase of two Donnet-Leveque flying boats or the establishment of two naval flying stations by the Orlogsværftet?",purchase of two Donnet-Leveque,purchase of two donnet - leveque flying boats,nabert,1ed7e19778cc03bedc0ad45a912d8c85,How many years after the Orlogsværftet produce began production on OV-flying boats was a naval flying station established in Copenhagen?,1,3.0,nabert,518dd40bd09b4e2cdcf0d38a856288aa,How many planes did the Royal Danish Navy acquire the first year?,3,2,naqanet,1d37767360b5263a5b255c9b8bc93636

"Succession is now regulated by laws passed by the National Diet. The current law excludes women from the succession. A change to this law had been considered until Princess Kiko gave birth to a son. Until the birth of Prince Hisahito, son of Prince Akishino, on September 6, 2006, there was a potential succession problem, since Prince Akishino was the only male child to be born into the imperial family since 1965. Following the birth of Princess Aiko, there was public debate about amending the current Imperial Household Law to allow women to succeed to the throne. In January 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed a special panel composed of judges, university professors, and civil servants to study changes to the Imperial Household Law and to make recommendations to the government. The panel dealing with the succession issue recommended on October 25, 2005, amending the law to allow females of the male line of imperial descent to ascend the Japanese throne. On January 20, 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi devoted part of his annual keynote speech to the controversy, pledging to submit a bill allowing women to ascend the throne to ensure that the succession continues in the future in a stable manner. Shortly after the announcement that Princess Kiko was pregnant with her third child, Koizumi suspended such plans. Her son, Prince Hisahito, is the third in line to the throne under the current law of succession. On January 3, 2007, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced that he would drop the proposal to alter the Imperial Household Law.",40181265ec029e7b6cb7e24266154559,How many months after a panel was formed did they make a decision to support a revision to the law?,9,4,nabert,3743d40980ddbcc9bebb2c01698a6a3a,How many months after the birth of Hisahito were plans to change the succession law dropped?,4,2,naqanet,d88b2536fdc58cfac955d10e29f673fe,Who was Hisahito's mother?,Princess Kiko,Prince,naqanet,384dc357c68dbb4c161a60d725ab9e45,How many months after the birth of Hisahito were plans to change the succession law dropped?,4,10,nabert,487859d20030cf349e5d4b3c5dbee2da,How many years after the Prime Minister promised to submit a bill allowing women to ascend the throne did he drop the proposal?,1,2006,naqanet,1a4f548819b7656dea16f7879ec2d68e,Who was Hisahito's sister?,Princess Aiko,princess kiko,nabert,f94871f872cc0031a43a0e2eeff1f3e9,How many different types of people did Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appoint to the special panel?,3,4,nabert,739a2cf616d4bd41316c5e2ac537e412,How many different types of people did Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appoint to the special panel?,3,2,naqanet,e29d8302758353d29f471b1284622d53,Princess Kiko is the mother of who?,Prince Hisahito,prince akishino,nabert,3997dc829526bf6cb5562b30b4ad1a69,How many months after a panel was formed did they make a decision to support a revision to the law?,9,2,naqanet,41ffe2015508ba25371eab082ffd8409
"Thailand is the worlds third largest producer of crude palm oil, producing approximately two million tonnes per year, or 1.2 percent of global output. Ninety-five percent of Thai production is consumed locally. Almost 85 percent of palm plantations and extraction mills are in south Thailand.

"The 5 October 1910 revolution was the overthrow of the centuries-old Portuguese Monarchy and its replacement by the Portuguese Republic. It was the result of a coup d'état organized by the Portuguese Republican Party. By 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal was in deep crisis: British pressure on Portugal's colonies, the royal family's expenses, the assassination of the King and his heir in 1908, changing religious and social views, instability of the two political parties , the dictatorship of João Franco, and the regime's apparent inability to adapt to modern times all led to widespread resentment against the Monarchy. The proponents of the republic, particularly the Republican Party, found ways to take advantage of the situation. The Republican Party presented itself as the only one that had a programme that was capable of returning to the country its lost status and place Portugal on the way of progress. After a reluctance of the military to combat the nearly two thousand soldiers and sailors that rebelled between 3 and 4 October 1910, the Republic was proclaimed at 9 o'clock of the next day from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho in Lisbon. After the revolution, a provisional government led by Teófilo Braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the Constitution in 1911 that marked the beginning of the First Republic. Among other things, with the establishment of the republic, national symbols were changed: the national anthem and the flag. The revolution produced some civil and religious liberties, although there was no advance in women's rights and in workers rights, unlike what happened in other European countries.",87b77b3afcd8bb30330c1ee483202a61,"How many years elapsed between the assassination of the King of Portugal, and the revolution to overthrow the monarchy?",2,-2,naqanet,e89d59f8f1357a65dab5fbc7c2c08f26,What did Teófilo Braga lead until the approval of the Constitution in 1911?,a provisional government,"provisional government led by teofilo braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the constitution in 1911 that marked the beginning of the first republic . among other things , with the establishment of the republic",nabert,39409c229ea816c7c3162b8cd5295a02,On what day was the Republic proclained?,October 5 1910,9,nabert,57680df31cc4130437d21befd1a45398,Who started  the revoultion?,Portuguese Republican Party,party,nabert,37f437ef73840b28b3c135f27c426274,How many years after the assassination of the Portuguese king was the revolution?,2,-2,naqanet,81db12169a7622218d079c2b1ab7970e,When was the Republic proclaimed?,October 5 1910,1911,nabert,e2cd49c6e7f12138ba6b91479db39311,When was the Republic proclaimed?,October 5 1910,1910,naqanet,a1e5f3340de997c8426cabc4452706f8,Which political party assumed control after the 5 October 1910 revolution?,the Portuguese Republican Party,the Portuguese Republic,naqanet,3c540a758debd3c2bd60a5f084919611,Who started  the revoultion?,Portuguese Republican Party,The Republican Party,naqanet,a39e28e03efe04497d55d9323a44f764,What did Teófilo Braga lead until the approval of the Constitution in 1911?,a provisional government,First Republic,naqanet,c42a207ca533cac2f6f0e252de71714d
"The Astros won the 2005 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, 3-1, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players used by a single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6-1, Lance Berkman hit an eighth-inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6-5. In the bottom of the ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus hit a game-tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the fifteenth inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out Julio Franco, at the time the oldest player in the MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if it came to that. Clemens struck out, but the next batter, Chris Burke (baseball), hit a home run to left field for the Astros win, 7-6. Oddly enough, a fan in the ""Crawford Boxes"" in left field had previously caught Berkmans grand slam and this same fan caught Burkes home run.

"The Bethencourt era ended in 1418 when Maciot sold his holdings and the rights to subjugate the remaining islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán. From this point on the intervention of the King of Castile increased. Between 1418 and 1445 dominion over the islands changed hands on a number of occasions. Finally, control over the conquered islands and the right to further conquests fell to Hernán Peraza The Elder and his children Guillén Peraza and Inés Peraza. The death of Guillén Peraza in the attack on La Palma has been immortalized in a moving lament. After the death of her brother Inés and her husband Diego García de Herrera became the sole rulers of the islands until 1477 when they ceded La Gomera to their son Hernán Peraza The Younger and the rights to the conquest of La Palma, Gran Canaria and Tenerife to the King of Castile. The island of La Gomera was not taken in battle but was incorporated into the Peraza-Herrera fiefdom through an agreement between Hernán Peraza The Elder and some of the insular aboriginal groups who accepted the rule of the Castilian. However, there were a number of uprisings by the guanches due to outrages committed by the rulers on the native Gomeros. The last one, in 1488 caused the death of the islands ruler, Hernán Peraza, whose widow, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, had to seek the assistance of Pedro de Vera, conqueror of Gran Canaria, in order to snuff out the rebellion. The subsequent repression caused the death of two hundred rebels and many others were sold into slavery in the Spanish markets.",89c903658b6ec5ab8dcdf0d3be6e462b,Who was Hernán Peraza The Younger's father?,Diego García de Herrera,Herrera fiefdom,naqanet,18ca89db2c70e09526c5c6edd0fcb21b,Who was the father of Inés Peraza?,Hernán Peraza The Elder,hernan peraza the elder,nabert,642675a47c9b9b0bac9cea266fb782fb,What year did the rebellion end?,1488,1445,nabert,74e94206a936c72a16ea9e333d90738b,Who was the husband of Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio?,Hernán Peraza,pedro de vera,nabert,c2ec84eb61c669c4f5de5ad0f5476f8b,Who was given the islands after 1477?,until 1477 when they ceded to their son Hernán Peraza,diego garcia de herrera,nabert,f9080169eb3f9663632310a04fc6a42f,Who was given the islands after 1477?,until 1477 when they ceded to their son Hernán Peraza,Hernán Peraza The Elder,naqanet,7a4d801ce989c644a06ad4cf20223d95,In what year did Hernán Peraza and his children receive control over the conquered islands?,1445,1446.0,nabert,bf0bc77aee17d400f58f8edac0bdaf01,Who needed help ending the rebellion?,Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio,"Hernán Peraza, whose widow, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, had to seek the assistance of Pedro de Vera",naqanet,f0b6d73d7f55e50d3f4af95c2a0bff6b,Who had control over the islands after 1445?,Hernán Peraza The Elder Guillén Peraza and Inés Peraza,Maciot sold his holdings and the rights to subjugate the remaining islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán,naqanet,5cac9de5968c0149b644106a203912ee,Who was the son of Inés Peraza?,Hernán Peraza The Younger,guillen peraza,nabert,baa42df994c9d22f86cdb06c03f9dece
"The Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles Simon Peter and Paul of Tarsus there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the Catholic Church. After the Decline of the Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to Byzantine Empire control after the Gothic War (535-554), which devastated the city. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273 to 35,000 after the Gothic War (535-554), reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens. It is generally thought the population of the city until 300 A.D. was 1 million (estimates range from 2 million to 750,000)  declining to 750-800,000 in 400 A.D., 450-500,000 in 450 A.D. and down to 80-100,000 in 500 A.D.

"The Bolsheviks' and Vladimir Lenin's October Revolution of 7 November 1917 transferred political power in Petrograd to the radical, left-wing socialists. The German government's decision to arrange safe conduct for Lenin and his comrades from exile in Switzerland to Petrograd in April 1917, was a success. An armistice between Germany and the Bolshevik regime came into force on 6 December and peace negotiations began on 22 December 1917 at Brest-Litovsk. November 1917 became another watershed in the 1917-1918 rivalry for the leadership of Finland. After the dissolution of the Finnish Parliament, polarisation between the social democrats and the conservatives increased markedly and the period witnessed the appearance of political violence. An agricultural worker had been shot during a local strike on 9 August 1917 at Ypäjä and a Civil Guard member was killed in a local political crisis at Malmi on 24 September. The October Revolution disrupted the informal truce between the Finnish non-socialists and the Russian Provisional Government. After political wrangling over how to react to the revolt, the majority of the politicians accepted a compromise proposal by Santeri Alkio, the leader of the Agrarian League. Parliament seized the sovereign power in Finland on 15 November 1917 based on the socialists' ""Law of Supreme Power"" and ratified their proposals of an eight-hour working day and universal suffrage in local elections, from July 1917.",b0b7184058bbb6a46713a7766e309e42,"Which happened first, safe conduct for Lenin to Petrograd, or the October Revolution?",safe conduct for Lenin,vladimir lenin ' s october revolution,nabert,d4d3ba16176a165fb5ed43aecb9325cf,"Which happened first, the agricultural worker shooting or the Civil Guard member being killed?",the agricultural worker shooting,agricultural worker had been shot,nabert,b9e4ad46c1650fb605eab52b7aede498,"Who was killed first, a Civil Guard member or an agricultural worker?",agricultural worker,Civil Guard member,naqanet,b210ac3bcf8d8d3b39a444c7c46de360,"Which happened first, safe conduct for Lenin to Petrograd, or the October Revolution?",safe conduct for Lenin,safe conduct for Lenin to Petrograd,naqanet,eff88715b2c0b48165ce72585c235adc,How many months passed between the two deaths during the political violence of 1917?,1,2,naqanet,ab83cddb91c97ff2195cbb707ebfd6fa,How many months passed between the two deaths during the political violence of 1917?,1,7,nabert,9a3487d5c49e2a0fc3e0ca15f9c700d3,"Which happened first, the agricultural worker shooting or the Civil Guard member being killed?",the agricultural worker shooting,Civil Guard member was killed,naqanet,d5210a7c88d003d9e39ce48a26384a3d,How many months after the October Revolution did the armistice come into force?,1,4,nabert,52a3c3ae839968c23da555049f774538,How many years did the rivalry for leadership of Finland last?,2,1,naqanet,f9151728c0efea68f327d2f646443311,How many days after an agricultural worker had been shot during a local strike was a Civil Guard member was killed in a local political crisis at Malmi?,46,15,naqanet,bcddd581aff7f61179a65db51f04d49d
"The Buccaneers hosted the Titans at Raymond James Stadium, their second inter-conference matchup in two weeks. Buccaneers running back Earnest Graham was a part of the starting lineup for the first time in his career, replacing the injured Michael Pittman, who sat out the game. The first half was a defensive struggle, with neither team scoring in the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Tennessee drove to the Buccaneers 32-yard line, but quarterback Vince Young fumbled the ball and the Buccaneers recovered. Jeff Garcia connected on a 39-yard pass play to Michael Clayton, to help set up a 23-yard Matt Bryant field goal, the first points of the game. Moments later, Phillip Buchanon intercepted Vince Young with 1:29 remaining in the half, to maintain a 3-0 halftime lead. Tennessee took the second half kickoff, and executed a 12-play, 45-yard drive which resulted in a 48-yard field goal by Rob Bironas. On their next possession, Vince Young ran out of bounds, and suffered a strained quad. He would have to leave the game, and was replaced by Kerry Collins. On Tampa Bay's next drive, Garcia connected with Joey Galloway for a 69-yard touchdown catch. On the ensuing drive Ronde Barber intercepted a pass by Kerry Collins, but it ruled incomplete after review. With less than four minutes remaining in regulation, Collins drove the Titans to the Buccaneers 23-yard line.

"The Byzantine civil war of 1373-1379 was a military conflict fought in the Byzantine Empire between Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos and his son, Andronikos IV Palaiologos, also growing into an Ottoman civil war as well, when Savcı Bey, the son of Ottoman Emperor Murad I joined Andronikos in a joint rebellion against their fathers. It began when Andronikos sought to overthrow his father in 1373. Although he failed, with Genoese aid, Andronikos was eventually able to overthrow and imprison John V in 1376. In 1379 however, John V escaped, and with Ottoman help, regained his throne. The civil war further weakened the declining Byzantine Empire, which had already suffered several devastating civil wars earlier in the century.

"The Conference of Ambassadors drew the first demarcation line on June 18. The line, drawn about 5 km  west of the Warsaw - Saint Petersburg Railway, was based on the military situation on the ground rather than ethnic composition.

"The Czech lands were among the first industrialized countries in continental Europe during the German Confederation era. The Czech industrial tradition dates back to the 19th century, when the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were the economic and industrial heartland of the Austrian Empire and later the Austrian side of Austria-Hungary. The Czech lands produced a majority  of all industrial goods in the Empire, some of which were almost monopolistic. The Czechoslovak crown was introduced in April 1919. Introduced at a 1:1 ratio to the Austro-Hungarian currency, it became one of the most stable currencies in Europe. The First Republic became one of the 10 most developed countries of the world . The consequences of the 1938 Munich Agreement and subsequent occupation were disastrous for the economy. After the occupation and forced subordination of the economy to German economic interests, the crown was officially pegged to the mark at a ratio of 1:10, even though the unofficial exchange rate was 1 to 6-7 and Germans immediately started buying Czech goods in large quantities. In accordance with Stalin's development policy of planned interdependence, all the economies of the socialist countries were tightly linked to that of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was the most prosperous country in the Eastern Bloc, however it continued to lag further behind the rest of the developed world. With the disintegration of the communist economic alliance in 1991, Czech manufacturers lost their traditional markets among former communist countries in the east. Today, this heritage is both an asset and a liability.

"The Eagles began their season at Bank of America Stadium for a Week 1 duel with the Carolina Panthers.  Philadelphia trailed early in the first quarter as Panthers running back DeAngelo Williams ran 11 yards for a Carolina touchdown on their first drive.  The Eagles answered with a 49-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. In the second quarter, Philadelphia exploded with points as defensive end Victor Abiamiri returned a fumble 2 yards for a touchdown, wide receiver DeSean Jackson returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown, and quarterback Donovan McNabb completed a 9-yard TD pass to tight end Brent Celek and a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook. Carolina ended the period with kicker John Kasay booting a 22-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Eagles closed out their scoring with McNabb scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run.  However, he was hit late by several Carolina tacklers who cracked his ribs on the right side, knocking him out of the game.

"The Front refused to officially disclose the number of members that it had. Thurlow suggested that ""the most reliable estimates"" were those produced by the anti-fascist investigatory magazine Searchlight (magazine). Following its establishment, the NF claimed to have 4000 members in 1968, and in February 1974 a branch chairman claimed that it had 20,000 members. Fielding suggested that it probably had about 21,000 members in early 1975, of whom 6,000 to 8,000 were ""paper members"" who had not renewed their membership subscriptions but not officially terminated their membership. Searchlight claimed that from its origins with 4,000 members in 1968, the party reached a peak membership of 17,500 in 1972, which had declined to 10,000 in 1979, to 3,148 in 1984, and to 1,000 in January 1985. An estimate of party membership in 1989 put adherents of the Flag Group at about 3,000 and of the Strasserite faction at about 600.

"The Lions were attempting to end a 21-game regular season losing streak at Green Bay's Lambeau Field, but were hampered by injuries to starting wide receivers Nate Burleson and Calvin Johnson, neither of whom could suit up for the game. Neither offense could get much going in the first half.  Mason Crosby converted field goals of 26 and 52 yards for the Packers, while David Akers hit a 53-yarder for the Lions, making the halftime score 6-3 in favor of Green Bay. Crosby connected again in the third quarter on a 31-yard field goal. The big blow of the game came just 1:26 later, when Aaron Rodgers found James Jones deep, resulting in an 83-yard touchdown and a 16-3 Green Bay lead. Two more Crosby field goals of 42 and 45 yards put the game out of reach.

"The Ogaden War was a Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden starting with the Somali Democratic Republic's invasion of Ethiopia. The Soviet Union disapproved of the invasion and ceased its support of Somalia to instead start supporting Ethiopia, whereas the United States conversely ceased its support of Ethiopia and started supporting Somalia. Ethiopia was saved from a major defeat and a permanent loss of territory due to a massive airlift of military supplies , the arrival of 16,000 Cuban troops, 1,500 Soviet advisors and 2 brigades from South Yemen, also airlifted to reinforce Harar. The Ethiopians prevailed at Harar, Dire Dawa, Jijiga and began to push the Somalis out of the Ogaden systematically. By March 1978, the Ethiopians had captured almost all of the Ogaden, prompting the defeated Somalis to give up their claim to the region. With 1/3 of the initial Somali National Army invasion force killed and 1/2 of the Somali Airforce destroyed, the war left Somalia with a disorganized and demoralized army and an angry population. All of these conditions led to a revolt in the army which eventually spiraled into a civil war and Somalia's current situation.",0df472d79950513906ea7a4d548ee567,"Which event happened first, the United States started supporting Somalia or the when the Ethiopians forced the Somalis to give up their claim to the region?",United States started supporting Somalia,United States,naqanet,bfcec31f68f0b4b5f15beaea73b48ae0,Who did the Soviet Union support during the Ogaden War?,Ethiopia,"Somalia to instead start supporting Ethiopia, whereas the United States",naqanet,d8d583ffa4e39f265d54ce72de9a9155,"Which did the Somalis lose more from, Somali National Army or Somali Airforce?",Somali Airforce,Somali National Army or Somali Airforce,naqanet,a2daa71a08554eabaf8042b5943ee9b8,"Which event happened first, the United States started supporting Somalia or the when the Ethiopians forced the Somalis to give up their claim to Ogaden?",United States started supporting Somalia,support of somalia to instead start supporting ethiopia,nabert,fa4d8af88a69c94fd1dedd1afbb83b6c,HO wmany troops arived from Cuba?,16000,massive airlift of military supplies,naqanet,a4b6bbc829452c84ebc8b91f49c16856,How many months did the Ogaden War last?,8,2,naqanet,b779131fc19e35e135e17549148b133d,"Which event happened first, the United States started supporting Somalia or the when the Ethiopians forced the Somalis to give up their claim to Ogaden?",United States started supporting Somalia,United States,naqanet,3e4c387da8415572c607a8caa9f25ae5,"Which event happened first, the United States started supporting Somalia or the when the Ethiopians forced the Somalis to give up their claim to the region?",United States started supporting Somalia,supporting ethiopia,nabert,73ac254d8dffa5aae0f619789a570ad8,How many months did the Ogaden War last?,8,3,nabert,bd2d05a614ee9023852f54f898705cbe,Was more of the initial Somali National Army force killed or were more of the Somali Air-force destroyed?,Somali Airforce,National Army invasion force killed,naqanet,8529ee96bbb745339cd5c6c03df78ab1

"The Sack of Brescia took place on February 18, 1512 during the War of the League of Cambrai. The city of Brescia had revolted against French control, garrisoning itself with Venetian troops. Gaston de Foix, recently arrived to command the French armies in Italy, ordered the city to surrender; when it refused, he attacked it with around 12,000 men. The French attack took place in a pouring rain, through a field of mud; Foix ordered his men to remove their shoes for better traction. The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the French, but were eventually overrun, suffering 8,000 - 15,000 casualties. The Gascon infantry and landsknechts then proceeded to thoroughly sack the city, massacring thousands of civilians over the next five days.

"The Serbian army emerged victorious, although details of the actual battle are vague. Şahin Bey entered Serbia with 20.000 akinjis at that time he learned that Serbian lords had prepared an army to attack his troops. He advanced to Pločnik near Prokuplje but could not detect the position of that army, and believed that there was none. At that time, many akinjis  lost their temper and began looting civilian properties in the surrounding villages by disobeying orders. Şahin Bey stayed alone with 2,000 soldiers. On the other hand, the battlefield was observed by Serbian expeditionary forces. Suddenly an allied army with 30,000 soldiers appeared, many of whom were cavalry. The Serbian army used heavy knight cavalry charge with horse archers on the flanks. The Serbs first attacked the Ottoman center , although they were unprepared and tasted nasty shock to heavy Serbian knights, the outnumbered Ottoman center resisted for some time but later began to withdraw with Şahin Bey who barely escaped with his life. Then the Serbian army turned to the other 18,000 akinjis that were busy plundering; unprepared, ill-disciplined, surprised akinjis couldn't do anything without their general. Only 5,000 of them returned home alive. More than 60% of the Ottoman army was destroyed. According to tradition Serbian knight and folk hero Miloš Obilić participated in this battle and distinguished himself, and was wounded by an Ottoman arrow. According to some, such as Croatian historian Vjekoslav Klaić, Lazar's army was aided by Bosnian troops.

"The Siege of Vienna in 1529 was the first attempt by the Ottoman Empire, led by Suleiman the Magnificent, to capture the city of Vienna, Austria. The siege signalled the pinnacle of the Ottoman Empire's power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe. Thereafter, 150 years of bitter military tension and reciprocal attacks ensued, culminating in the Battle of Vienna of 1683, which marked the start of the 15-year-long Great Turkish War. The inability of the Ottomans to capture Vienna in 1529 turned the tide against almost a century of conquest throughout eastern and central Europe. The Ottoman Empire had previously annexed Central Hungary and established a vassal state in Transylvania in the wake of the Battle of Mohács. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, ""The failure of the first  brought to a standstill the tide of Ottoman conquest which had been flooding up the Danube Valley for a century past."" There is speculation by some historians that Suleiman's main objective in 1529 was actually to assert Ottoman control over the whole of Hungary, the western part of which  was under Habsburg control. The decision to attack Vienna after such a long interval in Suleiman's European campaign is viewed as an opportunistic manoeuvre after his decisive victory in Hungary. Other scholars theorise that the suppression of Hungary simply marked the prologue to a later, premeditated invasion of Europe.",34b0cf3dc306e0951848eb59e58298a1,"Which happened first, the Siege of Vienna or the Battle of Vienna?",Siege of Vienna in 1529 Battle of Vienna of 1683,Siege of Vienna,naqanet,8e73e34269b096e259bb6c27a86e98e6,What battle started last: Battle of Vienna or Battle of Mohács?,Battle of Vienna,Battle of Mohács,naqanet,f08cd2ac9e631d1d6e1816925072f3cf,What battle started last: Battle of Vienna or Battle of Mohács?,Battle of Vienna,battle of mohacs,nabert,44e2e8fda8f8613772fa7d12767d09c0,What country had the Ottoman Empire established a vassal state in?,Central Hungary,Austria,naqanet,626069b26029540a1fce41ed3e31eb1e,What country had the Ottoman Empire established a vassal state in?,Central Hungary,transylvania,nabert,fb021386c324a0d90a74504afb635a74,How many countries were involved in the Great Turkish War?,2,3,naqanet,bf2e9cf5bcf80421db5d0bdea7e7f83d,What was Suleiman's  main objective in 1529,assert Ottoman control,to assert ottoman control,nabert,b6f3dd18455b0288c922c97e63afb9e9,What battle started first: Battle of Vienna or Battle of Mohács?,Battle of Mohács,Battle of Vienna,naqanet,637ee18059b9f32d5a8af966c71aae68,How many years was there fighting over Vienna till the end of the Great Turkish War?,169,1683,naqanet,3c2cbb5d73a6aa920933834df2e18734,When did the Great Turkish War end?,1698,1668,naqanet,93be561b3e2cd65576fc759f07f312d6
"The Treaty of Karlowitz, signed in January 1699, confirmed the Venetian possession of Kephalonia, and the Morea with the island of Aigina, which became organized as the ""Kingdom of the Morea"" , divided into four provinces: Romania, with seat at Nafplion , Laconia, with seat at Monemvasia , Messenia, with seat at Navarino, and Achaea, with seat at Patras . The war however had created a demographic and economic crisis in the Peloponnese. According to the first census conducted by the Venetians, there were 86,468 people in the peninsula compared to a pre-war population of around 200,000.

"The conflict between Novgorod and Teutonic Knights began in 1210, when the knights attacked the Estonians. Novgorod campaigned against the Livonians in 1217, 1219, 1222, and 1223, facing repeated failure. In 1224, the knights captured Dorpat . Soon after the capture of Dorpat, an internal conflict arose in Novgorod. The townspeople refused to help in the fight against the knights. Soon, a split occurred among the Novgorod nobles. Expelled from the city, the nobles and the Knights captured Izborsk in 1233, but soon were expelled from the city by the Pskov army.

"The country's economic transformation was far from complete. Political and financial crises in 1997, shattered the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May. The formerly pegged currency was forced into a floating system as investors sold their Korunas faster than the government could buy them. This followed a worldwide trend to divest from developing countries that year. Investors also worried the republic's economic transformation was far from complete. Another complicating factor was the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of GDP. In response to the crisis, two austerity packages were introduced later in the spring , which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. Growth dropped to 0.3% in 1997, −2.3% in 1998, and −0.5% in 1999. The government established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a revitalization program - to spur the sale of firms to foreign companies. Key priorities included accelerating legislative convergence with EU norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatising banks and utilities. The economy, fueled by increased export growth and investment, was expected to recover by 2000.",fa819e462a420100203c6c22c873c38e,How many percentage points did GDP growth drop from 1997 to 1999?,3.1,2.2,nabert,c7b9226660c4c148546b67b9c32cd02b,How many key priorities were introduced in the 1999 revitalization program?,3,4,nabert,7a79885a6481e18f3ab0bc40aabbb6b1,What could have been done to avoid the crisis?,enterprise restructuring,austerity packages,naqanet,9d67e27f0312c52463f79b644a4f2927,How many years in a row did the GDP growth decrease?,3,-1997,naqanet,77dfafdcbd85f070d6aba6395ef2fc7a,How many percentage points did GDP growth drop from 1997 to 1999?,3.1,2,naqanet,874f6f0cf4167024c30788d113f523ba,How many years in a row did the GDP growth fall  into negatives?,2,-1,naqanet,32ca2e2c076099ef6d2640b2cffb25fd,"In which year did GDP growth drop the least, 1997, 1998, or 1999?",1997,1998,nabert,7c61a865ee2b03df44ec2e173d737d28,How many years in a row did the GDP growth decrease?,3,4,nabert,9b04c3693835889f1a1f7850bcd08829,How many percentage points did growth drop from 1997 to 1998?,2,99.7,nabert,c67a2bb33af96c0ce65b67c7d49a88b8,"In which year did GDP growth drop the least, 1997, 1998, or 1999?",1997,1999,naqanet,4e044ea28f5c23260c93a60ba4ef6932
"The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort inline, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270 km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports , the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome.

"The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort inline, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270 km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports , the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome. Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year.

"The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunter-gatherer. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.",e9806aecbcd63605472697f3a458be01,Which animal was cultivated earliest?,Sheep,rye,nabert,ffc290ce750ff623718a90e2562e9986,Which crop was likely cultivated first?,Wild grains,rye,nabert,77523233cf8977307429fe31d754e90b,How many years passed between the cultivation of maize and the next most recent crop?,400,11500,naqanet,a2593c6f73b70b64dce123da7d0fedf8,"How many years after wild grains began being harvested was the potato domesticated, at its earliest?",95000,0,naqanet,2bbfdc23e29c0bf92fbcb8963b864c79,"Which two regions domesticated cotton, Peru and Eurasia or Peru and Mesoamerica?",Peru Eurasia,Peru and Eurasia,naqanet,2a5619e768487fac66a45588b4d92d99,Which animals were domesticated in different parts of the world at approximately the same time?,Cattle wild boar,guinea,naqanet,c425fc032ed6abeac7dc01e49672aacf,How many things originated from the Andes of South America?,6,5,nabert,2352c8c5c6808fb6cb979dd7171fa4b6,Which crops were cultivated in China?,Rice mung bean soy Azuki bean beans,rice,nabert,7699cb54217a4689e1c5e4558890d4cc,How many animals originate from Andes of South America?,3,0,naqanet,b1dd640b35db8d26a84d83f3e0ec8bc8,Which crops were cultivated in China?,Rice mung bean soy Azuki bean beans,chick peas and flax,naqanet,b78f1d497b300b60b166fcbdfe6c98e6
"The fact that the Irish Civil War was fought between Irish Nationalist factions meant that the sporadic conflict in Northern Ireland ended. Collins and Sir James Craig signed an agreement to end it on 30 March 1922, but, despite this, Collins covertly supplied arms to the Northern IRA until a week before his death in August 1922. Because of the Irish Civil War, Northern Ireland was able to consolidate its existence and the partition of Ireland was confirmed for the foreseeable future. The continuing war also confirmed the northern Unionists' existing prejudices against the ethos of all shades of nationalism. This might have led to open hostilities between North and South had the Irish Civil War not broken out. Indeed, the Ulster Special Constabulary  that had been established in 1920  was expanded in 1922 rather than being demobilised. In the event, it was only well after their defeat in the Civil War that anti-treaty Irish Republicans seriously considered whether to take armed action against British rule in Northern Ireland . The northern units of the IRA largely supported the Free State side in the Civil War because of Collins's policies, and over 500 of them joined the new Free State's National Army. The cost of the war and the budget deficit it caused was a difficulty for the new Free State and affected the Boundary Commission negotiations of 1925, which were to determine the border with Northern Ireland. The Free State agreed to waive its claim to predominantly Nationalist areas in Northern Ireland and in return its agreed share of the Imperial debt under the 1921 Treaty was not paid.",36a71071c4641c0f7aff04c58e0adc09,How many months after signing the agreement did Collins die?,5,4,nabert,ae268f5ff4d0a94dc7c40caf5fc1743d,"What event happened first, James Craig signing an agreement, or the Ulster Special Constabulary?",Ulster Special Constabulary that had been established in 1920,James Craig signed an agreement,naqanet,a93e8f6c7fbc646eebacbddee6debc50,How many months did Collins covertly supply arms to the IRA after he signed an agreement to end the conflict?,5,2,naqanet,b9e8885087850a65e29f8f5904aea420,How many months after Collins signed the agreement did he die?,5,3,nabert,23a740aff473ec24e72d0ff8c87bbfd7,How many years did these events span for?,5,3,naqanet,acf3e22a30d3b5376e2c23a2737dd092,Who's imperial debt share never got paid because they agreed to waive their claim to Nationalist areas in Northern Ireland instead?,The Free State,Sir James Craig,naqanet,0ac0db250dae7cc5a59e269491a46a0f,How many months did Collins covertly supply arms to the IRA after he signed an agreement to end the conflict?,5,3,nabert,53d2333b50a5dcb28802a1bd39b7c68c,How many months after Collins signed the agreement did he die?,5,2,naqanet,a79c581b5aef2d1df530740c2bd88917,How many months after Sir James Craig signed an agreement to end the conflict in Northern Ireland did he parish?,5,2,naqanet,c7ed2d6701dc80d155c22d5492e7e6e3,"Which happened first, the 1921 Treaty or the Boundary Commission negotiations?",1921 Treaty,Boundary Commission negotiations of 1925,naqanet,eccf7d7ac9522ed63f61d7a9b623061c
"The first 30 sports were announced by the Singapore National Olympic Council on 10 December 2013 on the sidelines of the 27th SEA Games in Myanmar. It announced then that there was room for as many as eight more sports. On 29 April 2014, the final six sports, namely boxing, equestrian, floorball, petanque, rowing and volleyball were added to the programme. Floorball will feature in the event for the first time after being a demonstration sport in the 2013 edition. In its selection of events, the organising committee indicated their desire to set a model for subsequent games in trimming the number of ""traditional"" sports to refocus on the SEAG's initial intent to increase the level of sporting excellence in key sports. Hence, despite room for up to eight traditional sports, only two, floorball and netball, were included in the programme. Amongst the other 34 sports, 24 are Olympic sports and all remaining sports are featured in the Asian Games.

"The first Azov campaign began in the spring of 1695. Peter the Great ordered his army  to advance towards Azov. The army comprised crack regiments and the Don Cossacks and was divided into three units under the command of Franz Lefort, Patrick Gordon and Avtonom Golovin. Supplies were shipped down the Don from Voronezh.In 1693 the Ottoman garrison of the fortress was 3,656, of whom 2,272 were Janissaries.Between June 27-July 5 the Russians blocked Azov from land but could not control the river and prevent resupply. After two unsuccessful attacks on August 5 and September 25, the siege was lifted on October 1. Another Russian army  under the command of Boris Sheremetev set out for the lower reaches of the Dnieper to take the Ottoman forts there. The main fort at Gazi-Kerman was taken when its powder magazine blew up, as well as Islam-Kerman, Tagan and Tavan, but the Russians were not able to hold the area and withdrew most of their forces. By the Treaty of Constantinople  the remaining Russians were withdrawn and the lower Dnieper was declared a demilitarized zone.",d58d1f35fd1c02f24147f99a54c0f88e,How many days did the Russians block the Azov from land?,9,-22.0,nabert,736606f8e7ee75fb3eecda529fb5a9be,How many days was the land blockade?,8,22,naqanet,534b302a20ee15701899a85b830d4404,Over how many days in 1693 did the Russians block Azov from land?,8,-22.0,nabert,29241f5f7277bf35db29633bda93cfe2,What happened second: Russians blocked Azov or Treaty of Constantinople?,Treaty of Constantinople,Russians blocked Azov,naqanet,441d5cf620d552ce936ff8c8d5e518f2,In what year was the Russian siege of Azov?,1695,-27,naqanet,ee412daee9978adcc036487726fa663e,How many days were there between the two unsuccessful attacks?,51,20,naqanet,63b5ca175b21863143e3dbe0f93058b7,In what year was the Russian siege of Azov?,1695,1693,nabert,7c86bce3da22e57052a9be9770cf52b2,How many days did the Russians block the Azov from land?,9,22,naqanet,c0362e0330b194e6e1b46f2ca4f99a9d,"Which happened first, the Russians blocked Azov or the siege was lifted?",the Russians blocked Azov,siege was lifted,naqanet,855f79a96fbfcf9a697c938d497fa852,How many days between the first and second attack?,51,20.0,nabert,d0183ec86a8c1a2a62df1d056f039d67

Following the outbreak of hostilities in July 1936 several large warships of the German fleet were sent to the region. The heavy cruisers  and , and the light cruiser  were the first to be sent in July 1936. These large ships were accompanied by the 2nd Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The German presence was used to covertly support Francisco Franco Spanish State although the immediate involvement of the Deutschland was humanitarian relief operations and evacuating 9,300 refugees, including 4,550 German citizens. Following the brokering of the Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War to enforce an international arms embargo the Kriegsmarine was allotted the patrol area between Cabo de Gata (Almeria) and Oropesa del Mar. Numerous vessels served as part of these duties including . On 29 May 1937 the Deutschland incident (1937) off Ibiza by two bombers from the Spanish Republican Air Force.

"The game started out with the teams trading punts, and when Houston attempted a punt from the Jets' 37-yard line, punter Chad Stanley fumbled the snap and the Jets had the ball at their own 46-yard line. A 36-yard completion from Chad Pennington to Laveranues Coles almost went for naught when Leon Washington fumbled a short pass, but Brad Smith recovered. Mike Nugent booted a 23-yard field goal to put the Jets on the board. On the Jets' next drive, Pennington led the Jets into Houston territory, aided by a pass-interference call on DeMarcus Faggins. Nugent kicked a 34-yard field goal for a 6-0 Jets lead. Houston rebounded, with David Carr converting a key third down to Andre Johnson to set up Kris Brown's 47-yard field goal. Pennington completed a long pass to Jerricho Cotchery on the next drive to set up Nugent's career-long 54-yard field goal to give the Jets a 9-3 lead. The half ended when Brown came up five yards short on a 59-yard field goal attempt. On the Jets' first possession of the second half, following a Houston punt, Pennington completed long passes to Chris Baker and Cotchery before finding Coles on a 12-yard touchdown pass. On the Jets' next drive, fans everywhere held their breath when Pennington was drilled by Mario Williams while releasing a pass and was slow to get up. Luckily, he only had the wind knocked out of him. Kerry Rhodes intercepted Carr soon after, and Pennington completed another long pass to Cotchery to set up Cedric Houston's 1-yard touchdown run and a 23-3 lead. The Jets' final score came after a 13-play drive that ate up 8:27, capped by Nugent's 40-yard field goal, his fourth of the game.

"The greatest single victory of the SNA-WSLF was a second assault on Jijiga in mid-September , in which the demoralized Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town. The local defenders were no match for the assaulting Somalis and the Ethiopian military was forced to withdraw past the strategic strongpoint of the Marda Pass, halfway between Jijiga and Harar. By September Ethiopia was forced to admit that it controlled only about 10% of the Ogaden and that the Ethiopian defenders had been pushed back into the non-Somali areas of Harerge, Bale, and Sidamo. However, the Somalis were unable to press their advantage because of the high attrition on its tank battalions, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, and the onset of the rainy season which made the dirt roads unusable. During that time, the Ethiopian government managed to raise and train a giant militia force 100,000 strong and integrated it into the regular fighting force. Also, since the Ethiopian army was a client of U.S weapons, hasty acclimatization to the new Warsaw Pact bloc weaponry took place. From October 1977 until January 1978, the SNA-WSLF forces attempted to capture Harar during the Battle of Harar, where 40,000 Ethiopians had regrouped and re-armed with Soviet-supplied artillery and armor; backed by 1500 Soviet ""advisors"" and 11,000 Cuban soldiers, they engaged the attackers in vicious fighting. Though the Somali forces reached the city outskirts by November, they were too exhausted to take the city and eventually had to withdraw to await the Ethiopian counterattack.",4bb09301f1949ea280fd3a2af20f692d,Did SNA-WSLF forces have more Cuban soldiers or more Ethiopian soldiers when they took part in the Battle of Harar?,Ethiopian soldiers,Cuban soldiers,naqanet,ccfcbbeadd1385d5823e79014eec1f5d,"Which had the largest group, Ethiopians,  Cuban soldiers or Soviet advisors?",Ethiopians,"soviet "" advisors",nabert,df441b8cac12d94db05f1150d806c39c,How many were on the Ethiopian side at the Battle of Harar?,40000,41500,naqanet,adcd206a316796ab56cbb886192d5219,"Which was an issue that the Somalis faced when trying to press their advantage over the Ethiopians, the withdraw of the Marda Pass, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, or demoralized troops?",constant Ethiopian air attacks,"withdraw of the Marda Pass, constant Ethiopian air attacks",naqanet,7f0f4ba72b51961f8a1fdf1b167c7929,How many men in all were on teh Ethiopian side during the Battle of Harar?,52500,41500.0,nabert,f963e882850d096a2904fa7d8e1597c6,The Battle of Harar took place in what interval?,October 1977 until January 1978,SNA-WSLF,naqanet,86ab5e5552a58276ed74e9318cb37ea3,Who had to withdraw from Harar?,Somali forces,ethiopian troops,nabert,2c624e4c912c321f7e248f8d262db960,Who attacked the Ethiopians?,Somalis,cuban soldiers,nabert,99fe69f62d1ba98821aee897f1b64af6,Who attacked the Ethiopians?,Somalis,"Soviet ""advisors",naqanet,875a8da2c1482d0504e794501a95034b,Who had to withdraw from Harar?,Somali forces,WSLF forces,naqanet,858db0c464fe859b528467a10ba33be9
"The irony of a Cardinal attacking the troops of a Pope was not lost on Rome, Spain, and ultra-Catholics in France. In 1625 the French marshals François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières and Charles de Blanchefort, Marquis de Créquy, joined the Duke of Savoy, invaded the territories of the dominion of Genoa. An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker. The time seemed opportune, with the apparent convergence of Protestant hostility to the Habsburgs, and explains French participation in the London talks with Mansfeld. Richelieu hoped Britain and the Dutch would send a fleet to assist his own squadron in cutting the seaway between Spain and Genoa, while Venice attacked Milan. François Annibal d'Estrées, Duke of Estrées and 3,500 French troops crossed Protestant Swiss territory to join a similar number of Rhetians levied with French money. More subsidies and troops poured into Savoy, where the French formed a third of the 30,000-strong army that began operations against Genoa in February 1625. The attack caught the Genoese Republic unprepared. Most of the Republic was overrun, while 4,000 reinforcements from Spain were intercepted by French warships in March.

"The popular uprising included large areas of Lower Bavaria, the Innviertel and eastern Bavaria. The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side.

"The rebellion of the city of Danzig  was a revolt from December 1575 to December 1577 of the city against the outcome of the Polish-Lithuanian royal election, 1576. The Polish throne was contested by Stephen Báthory and the Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II. It began on 12 December 1575 when Emperor Maximillian was chosen as monarch by the Polish Senate, while the majority of the szlachta  had voted for Bathory. It ended on 16 December 1577. Maximilian's II death in fall of 1576 weakened Danzig's position and made the conflict less about the recognition of the ruler than about Danzig's privileges. With neither side being able to defeat the other militarily, a compromise was reached, with economic as well as religious privileges of the city being restored and recognized, in return for a large reparation and recognition of Bathory as the king.",f96ceddfb4a071020deebc9edbfe282c,On what exact date did the Danzig rebellion begin?,December 12 1575,1577,naqanet,399da597410a5b42e1a78abb14e9491c,Which two privileges were restored to the city after Maximilian's death?,economic religious,Maximilian's II death,naqanet,beafaffcab03f6f98634633f06de473a,Which two people were competing for the Polish throne?,Stephen Báthory Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II,stephen bathory,nabert,e3c5f8c8e324b4920eca2edef4778363,On what exact date did the Danzig rebellion begin?,December 12 1575,1575,nabert,2c5413657c237db3e502e8ec0c3ea695,"What happened first, the end of the rebellion of the city of Danzig or Maximilian's II death?",Maximilian's II death,rebellion of the city of Danzig,naqanet,bb155750fe37baf88eeea9bc1c595015,Which two people contested the Polish throne in 1576?,Stephen Báthory Maximillian II,stephen bathory,nabert,3a5ca64d12462a822b4f7fb582b067f2,Who ultimately was crowned king?,Bathory,Maximilian's II,naqanet,5c83685bcb008985a119506948ca61ee,How many years did Maximillian II rule over Danzig?,1,2,naqanet,c7f9b39cb4cdebedfdf68c3ca764ca50,Which two people were competing for the Polish throne?,Stephen Báthory Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II,Stephen Báthory,naqanet,e88e46c5aeadb17d790dccfc549788c1,"What happened first, the end of the rebellion of the city of Danzig or Maximilian's II death?",Maximilian's II death,end of the rebellion,nabert,ab81a9c4cfb8e76502844d41799e9d8f
"The revolt was led by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow. Previously, the Socialist Revolutionary Party had supported the continuation of the war by the Provisional Government after the February Revolution of 1917.

The Bolsheviks invited left SRs and Martov's Menshevik Internationalists to join the government.

The Left SRs were given four Commissar positions and held high posts within the Cheka.

"The unit was split into two regiments in December 1939, with Fegelein in charge of both. By March 1941 their strength was 3,500 men. In July 1941, they were assigned to the Pripyat swamps (punitive operation), tasked with rounding up and exterminating Jews and partisans. The two regiments were amalgamated into the SS Cavalry Brigade on 31 July, twelve days after the operation started. Fegeleins final report, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, and 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses in November 1941 in the Battle of Moscow, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons. Fegelein was appointed as commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer on 20 April 1943. This unit saw service in the Soviet Union in attacks on partisans and civilians.

"The uprising greatly reduced the Tver Principality's power in the northeastern remains of Kievan Rus'. In 1328, Öz Beg granted Ivan Kalita the duchies of Novgorod and Kostroma. Alexander Vasilyevich, the prince of Suzdal, received Vladimir and a region encompassing present day Nizhny Novgorod and Gorodets. By granting the more prestigious Vladimir to the weaker of the two princes, Öz Beg maintained adherence to the principle of ""divide and rule,"" reasoning that Moscow's jealousy of Suzdal's lands would prevent them from allying to fight against the Golden Horde. Alexander moved to Sweden after his time in Lithuania, and then back to Pskov after the city's excommunication was lifted, under the patronage of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1335, he gained forgiveness from Öz Beg and was allowed to return to his former position in Tver, however by then, the state had lost most of its influence, being replaced by the Grand Duchy of Muscovy. This return did not last long, as both Alexander and his son Fyodor were taken to Sarai and quartered in 1339. Following the execution of Alexander Vasilievich in 1331, Ivan received the duchy of Vladimir and became the sole ruler of northeastern Russia. Favor from the khan of the Golden Horde allowed Moscow to gain power rapidly at the expense of Tver, with Tver eventually losing all influence to Moscow. However, a new rivalry was formed between the princes of Suzdal-Nizhny Novgorod. The relative power of Moscow and their strong alliance with the Horde led to a period of relative peace in Russia that was not interrupted until the reign of Dmitry Donskoy, the first prince of Moscow to openly challenge the Horde.

"Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.",ee7506fa31c88c7876a7573f4d7ecef4,"Which Russian army was smaller, the one that was sent to put down the unrest or the one that was facing the Japanese?",the one facing the Japanese,japanese,nabert,f1ac7c6e689a3c3c7e85d987da1971f5,"Before discontent of the Russian public set in due to the Japanese forces multiple failures, what event had actually rallied popular support for the war in the Russian public?",Japanese attack at Port Arthur,Port Arthur,naqanet,1779a6a144bd50ffc1bf2415957827e4,"Which army had the least soldiers, Russian or Japanese?",Japanese,russian,nabert,0be4dfc3a41104e78dee86ab7d7846ff,"Before discontent of the Russian public set in due to the Japanese forces multiple failures, what event had actually rallied popular support for the war in the Russian public?",Japanese attack at Port Arthur,1905,nabert,ec7e30739978d401849364590cb05e1a,Which revolution was the one that occurred before the February Revolution of 1917?,Russian Revolution of 1905,october,nabert,92b23ed1ca6094f58e89c6fae3d431a4,what was one reason that the emissaries sent to japan,intelligence gathering,sabotage and intelligence gathering within the russian empire and even plan a japanese - aided uprising,nabert,7056f0e050f5ac542e2662fd439cf75c,what was this seen as for the Romanov autocracy,a metaphor for the shortcomings,a metaphor,naqanet,a401835183797e28c1f4ccc76436ef48,What did not address the societal problems of Russian?,the October Manifesto,limited reforms,naqanet,c3e91bf0cc46590906023418eb898d1b,"with the defeat in 1905, what did this cause in the Russian military?",a reform,Japanese-aided uprising,naqanet,3c67d5d7461c9a8e39014eb4e9876320,what did the political leaders of the Polish insurrection send to Japan,emissaries,Russian Empire,naqanet,799f9c4dcaec5a04ddcdad0e3fc95ef0
"Tottenham Hotspur F.C. became a limited company, The Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd, on 2 March 1898 so as to raise funds for the club and limit the personal liability of its members. 8,000 shares were issued at £1 each, although only 1,558 shares were taken up in the first year. Members of the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s and were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in the 1960s and 1970s, were once the largest shareholder of the club. In the early 1980s, cost overruns in the construction of a new West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to financial difficulties for the club. In November 1982, Irving Scholar bought 25% of the club for £600,000, and together with Paul Bobroff gained control of the club.

The share issue was successful with 3.8 million shares quickly sold. Ill-judged financial decisions led to accumulating debts, and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing £3.25 million.

"Trying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Lions returned home for an NFC North rematch the-now 2-time NFC North champion Chicago Bears.  In the first quarter, the Bears struck first with kicker Robbie Gould nailing a 36-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Lions took the lead with QB Jon Kitna completing a 23-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell.  In the second quarter, Chicago bounced back with QB Rex Grossman completing a 13-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian.  Afterwards, RB Adrian Peterson got a 2-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, Detroit retook the lead with Kitna completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Mike Furrey and a 2-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams.  However, in the fourth quarter, the inconsistency that continues to plague the Lions showed as the Bears won with Gould getting a 36-yard field goal, a 39-yard field goal, and a 44-yard field goal and on a dropped pass by Mike Williams in the endzone on the last play of the game.

"Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.  They would wear their alternate uniforms as they played against the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 31-yard field goal, while QB Tom Brady completed a 1-yard TD pass to LB Mike Vrabel.  In the second quarter, the Bengals managed to get on the board with QB Carson Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  However, New England would respond with Brady completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. Near the end of the 2nd quarter, the Bengals had a chance to get closer to the Pats, but a miscommunication between Palmer and Chad Johnson resulted in a New England interception. Palmer and Johnson argued on the sidelines and all the way back to the locker room. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as Patriots RB Sammy Morris getting a 7-yard TD run.  The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal.  Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. With their third-straight loss, the Bengals entered their bye week at 1-3.  It also marked Cincinnati's 5th loss to New England in the last 6 meetings.

"Wearing bright orange uniforms and showing their speed on defense and special teams, the Chicago Bears overwhelmed the 49ers who were coming off their Bye Week. They jumped to a 24-0 first-quarter lead and 41-0 halftime cushion before coasting to a 41-10 victory. Brian Urlacher's one-handed interception was headed to the highlight reel as soon as he tumbled to the ground after somehow batting the ball to himself. Urlacher's stellar play symbolized what kind of afternoon it was for the refreshed and still unbeaten Chicago Bears - and how frustrating the day was for the San Francisco 49ers. San Francisco entered giving up 32 points a game, but the defense wasn't to fault early on because turnovers allowed the Bears to work from short fields. Drives started at the 15, 41 and 13, and they turned all three into touchdowns to take the big opening-quarter lead. The 49ers coughed up the ball a fourth time late in the half when WR Antonio Bryant caught a pass and fumbled, with CB Ricky Manning Jr. recovering. San Francisco averted a shutout in the fourth quarter on a 23-yard field goal by K Joe Nedney and a 16-yard TD pass from Smith to WR Antonio Bryant. QB Alex Smith finished 16 of 26 for 146 yards. RB Frank Gore rushed for 111 yards on 12 carries, thanks to a 53-yard run.

"When Matthias Corvinus died from a stroke on 6 April 1490, Frederick was able to regain the Austrian lands. However, he could not enforce the Habsburg succession to the Hungarian throne and in 1491 his son King Maximilian I signed the Peace of Pressburg with Vladislaus Jagiellon, who was elected Matthias' successor in Hungary. The treaty arranged for the return of Matthias' conquests, and the agreement that Maximilian would succeed Vladislaus should he produce no heir. This did not happen as Vladislaus' son Louis II was born in 1506, but the Habsburgs did exert significant pressure on the Jagiellonians with the 1515 First Congress of Vienna in which they arranged two royal weddings of Vladislaus' daughter Anne with Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand and of Maximilian's granddaughter Mary with Louis II. The double wedding celebrated at St. Stephen's Cathedral decisively advanced the Habsburg succession agenda. During his reign in Hungary, the new Polish king would go on to undo many of Matthias' efforts, unmaking the reformed system of taxation, the standing army, and the centralized authority of the monarch. Hungary's nobles would act in complicity with this, contributing to the weakening of the country until 1526, when Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács, whereby King Louis II was killed. The Habsburg archduke Ferdinand of Austria by his marriage with Anne of Bohemia and Hungary claimed the succession, he was enfoffed with the Bohemian kingdom by his elder brother Emperor Charles V and also reached the consent of the Hungarian magnates. He was crowned king in Pressburg  on 24 February 1527, laying the grounds for the transnational Habsburg Monarchy.",94c721ed11d102dd55ab9102759c04e4,Who is the father of King Maximilian I?,Matthias Corvinus his son King Maximilian I,Vladislaus Jagiellon,naqanet,897104421fdc7da4f95a5ca370a10993,What was Ferdinand of Austria's relation to Emperor Charles V?,brother,Habsburg,naqanet,af263aed4908086d02bf9b5eaa9ea916,Who was Maximilian's father?,Frederick,king maximilian i,nabert,47449cd1cc6c00262f5001c6e09ba83e,How many years old was Louis II when he died?,20,16,naqanet,519b52746abfa78d535bfa4e94808408,Who was King Maximilian I's father?,Frederick,Vladislaus Jagiellon,naqanet,c9f85b160a2ab2395986c7e3a82337c9,Who was Maximilian's father?,Frederick,Louis II,naqanet,bc48c92ecf25fbafe896db43afadeb86,Who became the king of Hungary following Louis II's death?,Ferdinand of Austria,Matthias Corvinus,naqanet,14224db9bd3432f3d7e532ca8d2f7f7d,Who became the king of Hungary following Louis II's death?,Ferdinand of Austria,king maximilian i,nabert,927d2a4fb999970c3bd12211b72b7559,What was Ferdinand of Austria's relation to Emperor Charles V?,brother,anne of bohemia,nabert,22f2133782bac4930305d4aa04237a2c,Who is the father of King Maximilian I?,Matthias Corvinus his son King Maximilian I,matthias corvinus,nabert,d9025b7f6b19afcca7078cb9a37739e1

"at the Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana Following two-straight wins over two division opponents (the Bucs and the Panthers), the Falcons flew to the Louisiana Superdome to take on the New Orleans Saints (who were playing in the Superdome for the first time since Dec. '04) for an NFC South match-up on Monday Night.  From the get-go the Falcons trailed, when they had a punt blocked by Saints safety Steve Gleason and DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone for the touchdown.  The Falcons would respond, as kicker Morten Andersen (who used to play for the Saints) kicked a 26-yard field goal.  That would be their only score of the night, as WR Devery Henderson ran for an 11-yard TD on a reverse.  Then, Saints kicker John Carney would provide the remaining points for the New Orleans, as he kicked two field goals in the second quarter (a 37-yarder and a 51-yarder) and one field goal in the third (a 20-yarder).  The Falcons would fall to 2-1, as their offense got swapped, battered, and bruised.  QB Michael Vick got sacked five times, while he and RB Warrick Dunn would only combine for 101 rushing yards.",5829f4e0f9e248701bd7307447c43e71,How many points did the Falcons fall behind?,2,1,naqanet,30697a8db5fe086b288bdfd38d5009cf,Which team won the game?,Saints,Falcons,naqanet,f9f797642f9c9b22f41fd1e222070b1a,How many field goals did Carney kick in the second half?,1,2,naqanet,06f18a06467d52471349b7ed8879f91e,Which team scored first in the game?,Saints,Falcons,naqanet,986859713838b38252f88cd222f20257,Which team scored first?,New Orleans,saints,nabert,e604dced38662a6b180b366244eac4a7,How many field goals did Carney kick in the third quarter?,1,2,naqanet,b81d597c4f315cf7e21effb72b7ad288,Which team won this game?,Saints,Falcons,naqanet,5e501e3ee0b9362be8dc256024c1a3f9,How many points did the Falcons score?,3,0,naqanet,bf85aafd418b029d8574895dd466f61d,How many times did the Falcons score in the game?,only score of the night,0,naqanet,ff53e52a4db1438f82c7464aa9137382,How many wins in a row was this for the Saints?,3,2,naqanet,4a6eafb4a36db6258ed384de9ea7ca3c

"Švitrigaila was losing his influence in the Slavic principalities and could no longer resist Poland and Sigismund. On 4 September 1437 he attempted to reconcile with Poland: he would rule the lands that still backed him , and after his death these territories would pass to the King of Poland. However, under strong protest from Sigismund, the Polish Senate declined to ratify the treaty . In 1438 Švitrigaila withdrew to Moldavia. The reign of Sigismund Kęstutaitis was brief — he was assassinated in 1440. Švitrigaila returned from exile in 1442 and ruled Lutsk until his death a decade later. Jogaila's son Casimir IV Jagiellon, born in 1426, received approval as a hereditary hospodar from Lithuania's ruling families in 1440. This event is seen by the historians Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki as marking the end of the succession dispute.",28611667507d865b4cc75a5a2f025bfc,What caused Sigismund Kęstutaiti's reign to end?,assassinated,he was assassinated,nabert,263b8bf93c28a4ec2662082f19347417,Whose approval as a hereditary hospodar marked the end of the succession dispute?,Casimir IV Jagiellon,svitrigaila,nabert,81198ac578b9afd34293676acfdf0170,How many years did Švitrigaila withdrew to Moldavia before returned from exile and ruled Lutsk?,4,-4,naqanet,1cc5b8b250540e7359830eb0d9a81e70,What happened first: he was assassinated or attempted to reconcile with Poland?,attempted to reconcile with Poland,he was assassinated,naqanet,4003c22d40e7abacca91e6d26b0e5b37,When did Švitrigaila die?,1452,1446.0,nabert,47f264cb50d904e1c12f0362ba1b8d99,What year did Švitrigaila die?,1440,1441.0,nabert,bdaf613cabcec2663b5cbf3fd424b029,Who was born first: Švitrigaila or Jagiellon?,Švitrigaila,svitrigaila,nabert,d36221f70817f3f400f28c584c7b3e8e,When did Švitrigaila die?,1452,1442,naqanet,31cbaa72569f1d95f1e2c14fb9cbb94f,"Who was ruler first, Sigismund of Casimir IV Jagiellon?",Sigismund,Casimir,naqanet,18401284fd1fd401e907958b29ed0433,What year did Svitrigalia die?,1452,1441.0,nabert,33dfdf1bb6bd0294cf4d55b350b393f3
