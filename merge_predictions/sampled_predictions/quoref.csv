"""Diamonds"" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna for her seventh studio album, Unapologetic (2012). It was written by Sia Furler together with its producers, Benny Blanco and StarGate. The song premiered on September 26, 2012, during the Elvis Duran and the Morning Show and was digitally released the following day as the lead single from Unapologetic. Def Jam Recordings serviced the single to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 2. ""Diamonds"" is a mid-tempo pop, electronic and R&B ballad that features heavy synthesizers, orchestral sounds and electronic rhythms. The song's lyrics serve as a departure from the themes of unhealthy relationships that were on Rihanna's previous singles and contain a prominent concept of love. ""Diamonds"" topped music charts in over twenty countries, including the United States, where it became Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and tied her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fifth-most number one singles in the chart's history. ""Diamonds"" was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and sold over 3.5 million digital copies in the country. By May 2013, it had sold over 7.5 million copies worldwide and became one of the best-selling singles of all-time. The song's music video was shot by director Anthony Mandler, a frequent collaborator of Rihanna's, and depicts her in four environments that represent the elements of earth, air, water, and fire. The video received positive reviews and was praised for its imagery. Some critics believe that the heavily tattooed man intertwined with Rihanna's arm in the video resembles Chris Brown. The singer performed ""Diamonds"" on television shows such as Saturday Night Live and The X Factor and included it on the 777, Diamonds, Monster Tour and the Anti World Tour set lists. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2013 and 2014. The official remix of ""Diamonds"" featured rapper Kanye West and was released on November 16, 2012. The song has been covered by various recording artists, including Josef Salvat, who released his own cover of ""Diamonds"" as a single.",f764ea7d77586d7a0a34c81def4f0a63,What is the name of the person who was tied with Madonna for fifth-most number one singles in the Billboard Hot 100's chart history?,Rihanna,"""Diamonds""",bert,753986c91eef9f530492db9e74a755ea,What is the name of the person who was tied with Madonna for fifth-most number one singles in the Billboard Hot 100's chart history?,Rihanna,"""Diamonds"" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna",bert,39e05f4a60510c0248303030684c3a09,What is the name of the person who was tied with Madonna for fifth-most number one singles in the Billboard Hot 100's chart history?,Rihanna,Rihanna's,bert,9459e4c1d0de4a345477c755105651cc,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"1951 - Having already killed OCD patient Billy Brown at the Redding House Asylum, a psychiatrist experiments on simple-minded inmate Melvin Veman and sociopath Levius Laitura. With Levius still alive, the psychiatrist has his orderlies put the bodies of all three men inside the crematorium to burn them.  Present Day - Camden College student Dylan tells his girlfriend Gabby and his roommate Kolt about the now abandoned asylum's haunted history. New student Emma moves in as Gabby's roommate and Kolt takes a liking to her. However, fellow students Allyson, Christine and Blythe do not. Dylan, Kolt, Gabby and Emma break into Redding House after a party to look around despite a warning from campus security guard Clyde. Emma has strange experiences while exploring on her own. The other three knock over a container of cremated ashes and inhale the dust of the three men burned there in 1951. A recovering psychiatric patient herself, Emma begins experiencing haunting visions upon returning to the dorm. The behavior of the other three students gradually changes as Billy possesses Dylan, Melvin inhabits Gabby and Levius takes control of Kolt's body. Allyson is killed by someone unseen while doing laundry. Christine is later killed while taking her dog outside. Suspecting that the disappearances and the odd behaviors are related to the asylum, Emma tries to go back to Redding House, but Clyde prevents her from going inside. With Levius in full control of his actions, Kolt attacks Emma. Emma eventually flees into the asylum and confirms her suspicions when she examines patient records and finds the empty urn knocked over by the others.

"1974, the present. Dorothy Yates lives with her husband Edmund in an isolated farmhouse in Haslemere, Surrey. They have just been released from a mental institution to which they were committed in 1957 after it was found Dorothy was a cannibal who killed and partially ate at least six people. It is later revealed that her cannibalism can be understood as an attempt to cope with a childhood trauma when she found out that she had eaten parts of her pet rabbit that her parents had cooked and served as dinner. Although her husband Edmund was convicted, it is later revealed that he only faked his dementia in order to remain with his wife. He is a truly devoted husband who loves his wife dearly and does not take part in the actual acts of murder in 1957 and in the present, only helping in covering them up. Now, it seems as if Dorothy has had a severe relapse. She secretly lures lonely young people to her home, promising tea and a tarot card reading, only with the sessions ending with a violent murder and ""feast"".   Jackie, Edmund's daughter by previous marriage, lives in London but secretely visits her dad and stepmum at night to bring her parcels containing animal brain, thereby implicitly feigning to commit murders for her so as to contain Dorothy's murderous urges. At the same time, Jackie tries to control her 15-year-old stepsister Debbie, Dorothy's actual daughter that she and Edmund had shortly before being committed to the asylum. Debbie has been recently thrown out of the orphanage. She now stays with Jackie and rides with her boyfriend Alec, head of a violent biker gang. Debbie incites Alec to start a fight with a barman in one of London's hip nightclubs because he denied her liquor due to her being underage.

"1974, the present. Dorothy Yates lives with her husband Edmund in an isolated farmhouse in Haslemere, Surrey. They have just been released from a mental institution to which they were committed in 1957 after it was found Dorothy was a cannibal who killed and partially ate at least six people. It is later revealed that her cannibalism can be understood as an attempt to cope with a childhood trauma when she found out that she had eaten parts of her pet rabbit that her parents had cooked and served as dinner. Although her husband Edmund was convicted, it is later revealed that he only faked his dementia in order to remain with his wife. He is a truly devoted husband who loves his wife dearly and does not take part in the actual acts of murder in 1957 and in the present, only helping in covering them up. Now, it seems as if Dorothy has had a severe relapse. She secretly lures lonely young people to her home, promising tea and a tarot card reading, only with the sessions ending with a violent murder and ""feast"".   Jackie, Edmund's daughter by previous marriage, lives in London but secretely visits her dad and stepmum at night to bring her parcels containing animal brain, thereby implicitly feigning to commit murders for her so as to contain Dorothy's murderous urges. At the same time, Jackie tries to control her 15-year-old stepsister Debbie, Dorothy's actual daughter that she and Edmund had shortly before being committed to the asylum. Debbie has been recently thrown out of the orphanage. She now stays with Jackie and rides with her boyfriend Alec, head of a violent biker gang.

"1986 — Thomás is born with his eyes closed, and he does not open them for several weeks following the birth. Julieta, his mother, is unconcerned, believing that when Thomás is ready and wants to open his eyes, he will. These events instill a strong belief in free will in young Thomás. Two weeks after his birth, Thomás opens his eyes, apparently to look directly at his five-year-old half-brother Francisco. 1992 — Julieta is a wife and a loving mother, working in a hospital emergency department. Her free-spirited youngest son, Thomás, is the product of her marriage to her second husband Alexandre. Pedro, her first husband and father of her eldest son Francisco, lives in Argentina. Pedro and Julieta remain good friends. During childhood, Francisco and Thomás are very close, perhaps too close according to Pedro, with whom they spend a Christmas holiday in Buenos Aires. Julieta is aware of their close relationship and tries to remain understanding. Not long later, Pedro dies. 2008 — Years later, when Francisco is 27 and Thomás 22, Julieta dies. The brothers become lovers and an unusual love story ensues. Thomás is invited to live and train in Russia for a few years in preparation for the Olympics. Though it is the first time they will be apart, Thomás leaves. Francisco struggles without Thomás. He meets a woman in a club and though he tries to pursue a relationship with her, they both realize he is dedicated to someone else.

"3 of Hearts' vocals and image received praise from music critics following the album's release. Billboard described the trio as ""possess[ing] angelic voices"" and praised 3 of Hearts as ""ear candy"". D Magazine said the album's pop composition could allow the group to have a crossover appeal, and compared them to the Dixie Chicks. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album as well-constructed and appealing, but criticized several songs – specifically ""Over the Edge"" – as sounding dated. He positively compared the trio's vocals to those of American band Rascal Flatts, and preferred their wholesome image over the more sexualized one attached to American singer Willa Ford. In a mixed review, Mario Tarradell of the Knight Ridder Tribune described the music as ""breezy"" and ""refreshing"", but noted that it was not innovative.Commentators criticized 3 of Hearts and the trio's vocals as generic and lacking an authentic country sound.

"4 is the fourth solo studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was released on June 24, 2011 by Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. Following a career hiatus that reignited her creativity, Beyoncé was inspired to create a record with a basis in traditional rhythm and blues that stood apart from contemporary popular music. Her collaborations with songwriters and record producers The-Dream, Tricky Stewart and Shea Taylor produced a mellower tone, developing diverse vocal styles and influences from funk, hip hop, and soul music. Severing professional ties with father and manager Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé eschewed the music of her previous releases in favor of an intimate, personal album. 4's lyrics emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé considering a maturer message to contend artistic credibility. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs to Columbia Records for consideration, twelve of which appeared on the standard edition. 4 was promoted in mid-2011 by television performances and festival appearances, such as Beyoncé's headlining Glastonbury Festival set. The album received generally positive reviews by music critics; several publications included it on their year-end lists. It was her fourth consecutive album to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200, and it also reached number one in Brazil, France, Ireland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 4 spawned the international singles ""Run the World (Girls)"", ""Best Thing I Never Had"", ""Party"", ""Love on Top"" and ""Countdown"". ""Love on Top"" won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance at the 55th annual ceremony.

"4 received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 36 reviews. Michael Cragg of The Observer called it Beyoncé's ""most accomplished album yet"". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson believed 4 succeeds vocally as an album of mostly intimate and slow-tempo ballads. Mikael Wood of Spin magazine applauded its ballads, mid-tempo songs, and evocations of late 1970s and early 1980s pop-soul. In his review for Rolling Stone, Jody Rosen wrote that Beyoncé eschews contemporary production styles for a more personal and idiosyncratic album. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times viewed it as a good showcase for Beyoncé as a torch singer, because she convincingly sings about heartbreak and the strong emotional effect of love. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal found it easygoing, retro-informed, and engaging because it shows ""one of the world's biggest stars exploring her talent in ways few could've predicted"". AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that the quality of Beyoncé's singing and the songwriting compensate for the assorted arrangement of the songs. Uncut viewed it is an exceptional album in spite of occasionally trite lyrics.In a less enthusiastic review, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly said the first half of 4 is marred by boring ballads and the songwriting in general are not on-par with Beyoncé's vocal talent. In his review for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis was ambivalent towards the album's 1980s influence and argued that, despite well written songs, it is not very consequential. Time magazine's Claire Suddath said the songs lack lyrical substance, even though they are performed well. Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, called 4 inconsistent, short, and unfinished.

NME magazine's Hamish MacBain felt Beyoncé did not progress from her past work and that ""even the OK bits here"" sounded ""uninspired"".",e9c40b870a7f8f6e9c7f7552a0f1985d,What is the name of the publication who's critic claimed the songs on the album lack lyrical substance?,Time,"Guardian,",bert,f4b01c8bff684e76fe276345bb980492,What is the name of the publication who's critic claimed the songs on the album lack lyrical substance?,Time,Time magazine's,bert,bdaff536b0dbe25c2cf708b12ecb2bde,What is the name of the publication who's critic claimed the songs on the album lack lyrical substance?,Time,Uncut,bert,b7aa3092129352392d4d074f1558194b,"What is the name of the the publication who's critic claimed the album that got an average score of 73 was inconsistent, short, and unfinished?",Chicago Tribune,"Chicago Tribune, called 4 inconsistent, short, and unfinished.

"A Boston Globe article attributed Barack Obama's win in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election to a marked reduction over the preceding decades in the percentage of whites in the American electorate, attributing this demographic change to the Immigration Act of 1965.

"A Drax Industries Moonraker space shuttle on loan to the United Kingdom is hijacked in midair. M, head of MI6, assigns James Bond, Agent 007, to investigate. En route to England, Bond is attacked by the Apollo jet crew and pushed out of the plane by the mercenary assassin Jaws. He survives by stealing a parachute from the pilot, whilst Jaws lands on a trapeze net within a circus tent. At the Drax Industries shuttle-manufacturing complex in California, Bond meets the owner of the company, Hugo Drax, and his henchman Chang. Bond also meets Dr. Holly Goodhead, an astronaut, and he then survives an assassination attempt while inside a centrifuge chamber. Drax's personal pilot, Corinne Dufour, helps Bond find blueprints for a glass vial made in Venice; Drax discovers her involvement and has her killed by his pet dogs.  Bond again encounters Goodhead in Venice and observes her snooping around a door near the glass factory. Then he is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He returns to the factory at night to check the door out, and discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals.

"A U. S. military station in Houston, the United States Decoding Service, NASA Wing, has intercepted a message from outer space. After decoding, the message contains only the cryptic statement: ""Mars ... Needs ... Women"" Martians have developed a genetic deficiency that now produces only male children. A mission to Earth is launched, consisting of five Martian males, led by Dop. Once here, their team intends to recruit Earth women to come to Mars to mate and produce female offspring, saving their civilization from extinction. Using their sophisticated transponder, Dop attempts to make contact with the U.S. military, which has now tracked the aliens' arrival on Earth. The military eventually views the Martians as invaders, so the team takes on the guise of Earth men, acquiring human clothes, money, maps, and transportation. They finally select their prospective candidates, setting their sights on four American women: a homecoming queen, a stewardess, a stripper, and, most especially, a Pulitzer Prize-winning scientist, Dr. Bolen, an expert in ""space genetics"". Resorting to hypnosis, the women are captured, but Dop quickly becomes enamored with Dr. Bolen; soon he is ready to sabotage their mission for her. After the military discovers their hideout, the Martians are forced to return home without their female captives.

"A boy obsessed with football finds his life changing dramatically once he adds a little Samba. Danny plays on the football team at the all-boys Catholic school he attends in Belfast. Danny's three best friends, who also play on the team, all have different ambitions for their lives. Mickey wants to be a fashion designer so he can get rich and date supermodels. Gary wants to become a magician so he can get rich and meet beautiful women (and presumably saw them in half). And Spike likes to beat people up, so he wants to become a mercenary and do it for a living. But Danny dreams of making football his life. The players Danny most admires are South Americans, such as Pele and Carlos Riga, who he feels have a special rhythm and flexibility. Wanting to add some of these qualities to his own game, Danny has an idea: he'll take Samba lessons, in the hope that dancing like a South American will help him play like a South American. To the surprise of himself and his friends, Danny turns out to be a pretty good Latin dancer and finds himself smitten with a student in his dance class, Lucy. However, Lucy happens to have a boyfriend, who is a fierce competitor on one of Danny's rival teams. The film also stars Brian Flanagan who plays an inspiring cameo role along with members of Celbridge Town Football Club.",e22ec72eabaf4321ce8d03dbf0483ee8,Who are Danny's three best friends?,Mickey,"Carlos Riga,",bert,8db76e25991ecf6c02f3929b7d39a707,Who are Danny's three best friends?,Mickey,Gary,bert,ab7ab9c288a946876b0b2c25f17b4957,Who are Danny's three best friends?,Mickey,Mickey wants to be a fashion designer so he can get rich and date supermodels.

"A brief article mentioning the discovery appeared in the Maidstone Journal on 4 July 1822; the information in it was then largely repeated in a volume of the Gentleman's Magazine that year. The latter also features some brief discussion as to who the deceased individuals in the chamber had been, speculating that it was ""some chief slain in the battle fought here between Vortimer, King of Britain, and the Saxons"". A second description of the site appeared in Gentleman's Magazine in 1834, written by S. C. Lampreys.About a year after the discovery, Smythe wrote an account in which he included both a sketch and plan of the chamber. Smythe's original report was not published at the time, but deposited in the archive of Maidstone Museum. In this unpublished document, he referred to the monument as a ""British Tomb"" or a ""Druidical Monument"". The document was only published in 1948, in an article written for the Archaeologia Cantiana journal by the archaeologist John H. Evans. Evans noted that ""meagre and incomplete as it is"", ""we must be grateful"" for this document ""when we remember the unrecorded destruction wrought throughout the centuries upon this interesting and isolated megalithic necropolis"".Alongside Smythe's report, another brief account was also produced and placed in the museum, likely written by Charles and again published in Evans' 1948 article. Ashbee later related that both of the reports written in the 1820s were ""brief but valuable"" and ""in many ways in advance of their age"". He noted that the destruction of prehistoric monuments during this ""age of agricultural development"" would have been quite commonplace and thus these antiquarians' records — written ""almost half a century before the emergence of the outlines of present-day prehistory"" as a field of scholarly study — were particularly important.In the 1920s, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford accessed the Maidstone Museum archives to determine the probable location of Smythe's Megalith. He then included it in his 1924 Ordnance Survey guide to archaeological sites in southeastern England. In 1955, several substantial stones were also found in the area. In 2000, Ashbee stated that some of the kerbstones had ""recently come to light, buried in the ditches"" of the monument.",1add0be3be321aa7ce7ee1f14ffd965b,What is the last name of the man who included the location of the Smythe's Megalith in his 1924 Ordnance Survey guide?,Crawford,Ashbee,bert,9b292d4a6e7b8ae111798742214c2806,What is the last name of the man who included the location of the Smythe's Megalith in his 1924 Ordnance Survey guide?,Crawford,Evans,bert,9528f74ca38bf74269f640e91df0658c,What is the last name of the man who included the location of the Smythe's Megalith in his 1924 Ordnance Survey guide?,Crawford,Evans.

"A divorcee, Zoe Jensen, moves to San Francisco from Omaha in an effort to rebuild her life. She has reluctantly left her young son back home with his grandmother until she is more financially secure. She joins a local church choir which has just gained a new, demanding choirmaster—retired music conductor Ephraim Adams. Adams challenges the choir to dramatically improve, creating discomfort for some of the members, particularly when he sets the high goal of performing Handel's Messiah for a Christmas concert. Meanwhile, the choir overcome personal setbacks as they all deal with personal issues. A teacher by profession, Zoe soon learns no positions are available and that she lacks training to perform more readily available work. Living in an inexpensive flat, she brushes up her typing skills in order to gain employment before her mother wearies of looking after her son, who is growing anxious from his separation from Zoe. Zoe receives her grounding at church, where an assortment of inner-city residents range from a former opera singer to a student seeking to educate himself for a life in a profession. The opera singer falls by the wayside when ego gets in her way, while the student is falsely accused of vandalism to the church organ simply because of his race, yet is vindicated by those who know and believe in him. Together, they persevere in the church choir. Along the way, Zoe finds an office job and, with the help of a bargain hunter, prepares a pleasant home for her son and herself. Unexpected talent abounds within the choir. The amateurs give their best as ones who perform for the love of the music. This love extends far beyond the choir loft and is exemplified when the choir members band together to make the needed repairs to the organ pipes.",4f71e813bb5316fc8f9dad2f4a2959e4,Who joins a local church choir with a new demanding choirmaster?,Zoe Jensen,Zoe,bert,a3e3dd169a48a14dc84734e5815ef1d4,Who joins a local church choir with a new demanding choirmaster?,Zoe Jensen,"Zoe Jensen, moves to San Francisco from Omaha in an effort to rebuild her life.

"A group of teenagers verging on adulthood are to spend a year in a remote village in Indonesia, learning to live on the same terms as the people in that village. Their teacher is going along as well, but he decides to make a little extra money along the way: he cancels out on their scheduled transport to the village's nearest airport and hires a decrepit plane and its pilot, who's seen better days for his income. The deal is that the pilot will make out the receipt for a higher amount than the teacher actually pays. The pilot, in turn, makes a deal with drug dealers to make a delivery, so when the plane takes off with the students aboard and the teacher in the co-pilot's seat, it isn't flying the direction the teacher and the students require to get to their destination. The plane has mechanical troubles, and lands in the water near an island while the pilot checks it out. He informs the teacher that he'll have to return to an airport for repairs, and teacher says he's going along to make sure the pilot returns. That leaves the students on the island. While they wait, some of them explore, but one dies in the rising tide after a rock traps his foot against another rock. As night approaches, they decide to leave the beach and find a better campsite. They leave a note for the pilot and teacher that they'll listen for the plane. Meanwhile, the plane is having even more mechanical problems, as the pilot gives a grim comment to the teacher. Many of them quickly discover they need a leader to make decisions and serve as arbiter in disagreements. Having accepted one boy, they then decide on some rules, such as lavatory rules. Some days later, the airplane is spotted next to the shore of the island. The leader leads them cross-country to the plane to check it out, and he briefly gets caught in quicksand and panics, but is extricated without threat to his life, although a passing snake rubbing behind him freaks him out.",43d35c1dff7a5999a25eef5e155b92ef,What is the position of the person that gets caught in quicksand?,The leader,co-pilot,bert,ce98efdf57b90e3b436c14b6a680c165,What is the position of the person that gets caught in quicksand?,The leader,pilot,bert,e6db36a617de7d5f68d54c7463b39e36,What is the position of the person that gets caught in quicksand?,The leader,"pilot, who's seen better days for his income.

"A lady shepherd owns dozens of lambs. She even runs a school where she teaches them. One day, while giving roll call in a class, she notices one of her lambs is missing. She then abandons her teaching session, and goes out to find the lost one. Out in the open, the missing lamb is playing with some blossoms instead of attending school. She is momentarily spotted by a jackal in luxury car. To deceive the lamb, the jackal, disguised as a person in a mask, greets and offers her a ride. But the lamb is uninterested and just walks away. In his second plan, the jackal dresses as a sheep and carries a picnic basket. He then asks the lamb if she would like to come along. This time the lamb accepts. Meanwhile, the lady shepherd, after being unable to locate her lamb, comes to a detective agency owned by Krazy Kat. When he hears about her problem, Krazy takes out a pair of hounds, and sets off. Up on a hill in the open, the missing lamb and the jackal, who's still in his sheep disguise, are having their ""picnic."" Eventually, Krazy and the hounds come to the scene. Krazy warns the lamb that her companion is actually a vicious jackal. When the lamb is doubtful of the idea, the hounds rush forth at the impostor sheep, tearing up his disguise. Upon getting exposed, the jackal quickly picks up the lamb, and flees in a nearby car. Krazy and the hounds go on a chase and struggle to rescue the lamb. Moments later, the agitated lamb strikes the jackal who then loses control, causing both of them to be thrown out of the car. And before he could do anything else, the jackal is tackled by the hounds. Krazy returns to the lady shepherd's school, dragging the jackal with him. The other lambs celebrate his deed in cheering him on.",f79120e4c2dcf7b226b1c780057b4320,What costume does the animal that drives a car use to trick the lamb into a picnic?,sheep,impostor sheep,bert,cc35f2370bf54238087bfc2856c280a0,What costume does the animal that drives a car use to trick the lamb into a picnic?,sheep,person in a mask,bert,26e3477cf767961669bf6fa30768d5dd,What costume does the animal that drives a car use to trick the lamb into a picnic?,sheep,the jackal,bert,f5da7ada353a7da9e208ee6a29a62a12,What costume does the animal that drives a car use to trick the lamb into a picnic?,sheep,"the jackal, disguised as a person in a mask",bert,648f049c4a4e653bfaac02b05e3f92da,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"A mysterious man dresses in a Santa Claus suit, complete with a mask. Once dressed, ""Santa"" captures and kills Jordan, a police officer in the small town of Cryer, Wisconsin. Jordan is sleeping with the married Alana Roach and is electrocuted with Christmas lights in his home. The following day, Christmas Eve, the Sheriff of Cryer, Sheriff Cooper, calls Deputy Aubrey Bradimore in on her day off when Jordan doesn't arrive at work. Aubrey is a new addition to the police force, and is still reeling from the unexpected death of her husband John. She doesn't think she's a good officer as she is trying to live up to her father, who is a retired cop. Aubrey was going to spend the holiday with her parents but instead goes out to check on Jordan, finding his mangled body and Roach torn apart later in the day. Sheriff Cooper decides not to tell Mayor Revie until the case is solved. Meanwhile, the masked Santa killer goes on a murder spree, killing those who have done something he considers 'naughty.' His next victim is a bratty teenage girl who he kills with a taser, then he makes his way to the local motel, murdering a group of people during a softcore porn shoot. One woman manages to escape and tries to hide inside a Christmas Tree farm, but the killer chops off one of her legs and throws her feet-first into a woodchipper. Sheriff Cooper calls in Deputy Stanley Giles and goes out to find the killer himself, but comes back empty handed. Aubrey starts to suspect Santa Jim Epstein, a local drunken Santa portrayer, drug dealer Stein Karsson, and the perverted Reverend Madely (Curtis Moore).",8a346e8c5ec372930be0c17f1167b097,What is the first name of the person that was married to John?,Aubrey,Alana,bert,26d66f0d39145bdfb380ccfc8a35f97a,What is the first name of the person that was married to John?,Aubrey,Aubrey Bradimore in on her day off when Jordan doesn't arrive at work.

"A poacher hides from an unknown creature in his boat. While it breaks through the boat and attempts to catch the poacher, he commits suicide by shooting himself dead to prevent the beast from killing him. Meanwhile while shooting a documentary about a long-lost indigenous tribe, the Shirishamas, on the Amazon River, director Terri Flores and members of her crew including cameraman Danny Rich, production manager Denise Kalberg, her boyfriend, sound engineer Gary Dixon, visionary Warren Westridge, anthropologist Professor Steven Cale, and boat skipper Mateo come across stranded Paraguayan snake hunter Paul Serone and help him, believing he knows how to find the tribe they are searching for. Most of the crew are uncomfortable around Serone, and Cale clashes with him several times in regards to Shirishama lore. Later, while trying to free the boat's propeller from a rope, Cale is stung in the throat by a wasp inside his scuba regulator, which swells his throat shut and leaves him unconscious. Serone performs an emergency cricothyrotomy, seemingly saving Cale's life. With that, Serone takes command and captain of the boat and the crew. They are then forced to help him achieve his true task: hunting down and capturing a giant record-breaking female green anaconda he had been tracking the whole time. Later, Mateo gets lost and is the first to be killed by the anaconda, which coils around him before it snaps his neck near the boat where the poacher had been killed. A photograph in an old newspaper reveals that Mateo, Serone, and the unnamed poacher were actually working together to catch animals, including snakes.

"A recently widowed Englishwoman, Mary Panton, is staying at the villa of some wealthy friends outside of Florence, Italy in 1938. After meeting her old friend Sir Edgar Swift at a party celebrating the Munich Agreement, she is surprised when he proposes marriage to her the next day. She asks for a few days to think the proposal over, and he agrees to meet with her on his return from Rome. That evening, at a party hosted by her friend, the Princess San Ferdinando, she meets a married American man named Rowley Flint, who has a reputation for being a rogue. A violinist arrives to entertain the guests but is so terrible that the Princess has him removed. Out of sympathy Mary leaves him a large tip. Rowley drives Mary home, but on the way stops at a small church, where she confesses that her husband was an abusive alcoholic who died in a car crash, leaving her destitute. Rowley tries to kiss her but Mary slaps him and drives away. She is so flustered that she almost collides with a young man in the road, who turns out to be the violinist from the restaurant. Seeing that he is poor and hungry, she invites him up to the house for a meal.

"A speedy drafting process was required because Roosevelt, Churchill and their political and military advisors converged for the Quadrant Conference at the Citadelle of Quebec on 17 August, hosted by the Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King. Most of the discussions were about the invasion of France. Although the Quebec Agreement was a bilateral one to which Canada was not a signatory, the British felt that Canada's contribution to Tube Alloys was significant enough that high-level representation was appropriate. King was therefore asked to nominate a Canadian member of the Combined Policy Committee, and he selected C. D. Howe, the Canadian Minister of Munitions and Supply. Stimson, Bush and Conant would be the American members, while Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin would be the British members.On 19 August Roosevelt and Churchill signed the Quebec Agreement, which was typed on four pages of Citadelle notepaper, and formally titled ""Articles of Agreement governing collaboration between the authorities of the USA and UK in the matter of Tube Alloys"". The United Kingdom and the United States agreed that ""it is vital to our common safety in the present War to bring the Tube Alloys project to fruition at the earliest moment"", and that this was best accomplished by pooling their resources. The Quebec Agreement stipulated that: The US and UK would pool their resources to develop nuclear weapons with a free exchange of information; Neither country would use them against the other; Neither country would use them against other countries without consent; Neither country would pass information about them to other countries without consent;",e21ac798d4e1b06f078348866f34ff9b,What is the first name of the person who was asked to nominate a Canadian member of the Combined Policy Committee?,Mackenzie,C.

"A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal. His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome. His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style"", prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility. By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in Histoires naturelles. The same technique is highlighted in Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided. In the cycles Shéhérazade and Chansons madécasses, Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment.Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques, Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires. Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue, Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine. For three songs dating from 1914–15, he wrote his own texts.Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.",bd8b703484f68b23b6e684f7f76d8b0d,"What is the name of the person who drew upon the lyrics of poets that included Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue, Leconte de Lisle, and Verlaine?",Ravel,"Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment.Ravel's",bert,5704eb0ae8a25ade956276f3f0882f1d,"What is the name of the person who drew upon the lyrics of poets that included Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue, Leconte de Lisle, and Verlaine?",Ravel,Ravel's,bert,1c2fc8fc6e2db72f0d25da535e5d6a48,"What is the name of the person who drew upon the lyrics of poets that included Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue, Leconte de Lisle, and Verlaine?",Ravel,accompaniment.Ravel's,bert,5d5f57ca75a4401d58cb946111d775e3,"What is the name of the person whose early vocal music from the Prix de Rome period is described by Kelly as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style,"" with prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility?",Ravel,Debussy's,bert,a1741aa17cb9fb51fba0384343d5edad,"What is the name of the person whose early vocal music from the Prix de Rome period is described by Kelly as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style,"" with prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility?",Ravel,Ravel's,bert,c7b77b530c18318182fd31475ad6188d,"What is the name of the person whose early vocal music from the Prix de Rome period is described by Kelly as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style,"" with prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility?",Ravel,l,bert,6fbda7db726d7972886debe86e6250ef,What is the name of the person whose word-setting is noticeably more formal than Ravel's?,Debussy,"Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel,",bert,8082e7d68a249fd90c2cc26cf14e3586,What is the name of the person whose word-setting is noticeably more formal than Ravel's?,Debussy,Ravel,bert,9d0c4a923a8b3bc0818cb87d95f718e7,What is the name of the person whose word-setting is noticeably more formal than Ravel's?,Debussy,Ravel was taking even further than Debussy,bert,3bafbfd658e2c64b753e01fbb7ba787c,"Whose vocal music did Kelly describe as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style""?",Ravel,Debussy's,bert,228776a88e80c7807744787550094c16,"Whose vocal music did Kelly describe as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style""?",Ravel,Ravel's,bert,db0afd8467cf5d05936749dda6c05be5,Whose word-setting is noticeably more formal?,Debussy,"Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel,",bert,85c6fc290b011593d005d4d9c636e6d7,Whose word-setting is noticeably more formal?,Debussy,Ravel,bert,db164e735670d2a7ab6ef260c6708bcf,Whose word-setting is noticeably more formal?,Debussy,Ravel's,bert,6e6cbf374963fd5584981a82134d1598,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"A tree comes down in a forest and several lumberjacks hack away at it with their axes. To the side, two lumberjacks, one a muscular man, the other one rather scrawny, chop at a tree, but only the larger man makes any progress. The skinny fellow prances off to a tiny sapling and with some effort chops it down, only to end up with pieces of it stuck to his head. The pieces resemble antlers. The lumber men have several inventive methods for chopping trees: one, involving a tractor-like vehicle with a large saw protruding from its side, leads to the felling of a guard tower in the forest! The scene switches to Buddy, who, upon chopping a tree with his axe, sends such a shake upwards that a mother and father bird are forced to remove their nest and babies from the tree top and carry the nest elsewhere. Some time obviously passes, for in the next scene, Buddy has already succeeded in felling the trunk. Merrily whistling away, Our Hero next gently glides a lawnmower-like device across a fallen trunk, in the process creating many toothpicks, which he then dumps into a truck, yelling to the driver: ""Take it away!"" Using a saw as though it were a jump rope, Buddy cuts a standing tree into several smaller pieces. Buddy so goads a goat that the creature chases him. The goat's horns cut through the suspended logs atop which Buddy runs from the pursuing creature. Eventually, the goat rams headfirst into a tree, and gets incapacitated. Buddy then carries an armful of small logs, but drops them, upon tripping, just perfectly that they are arranged across a wooden stand as a xylophone, which Buddy then plays by means of two axes: a totem pole comes to life and dances for the lumberjacks. The hard-working men are called to supper: enthusiastically, they wash up. A song before the meal: ""I Open the Old Northwest"", with Buddy at the piano. Cookie serves the men their spaghetti.",8cc796d41210a1d60759cdf007873227,What does Buddy do to create toothpicks?,glides a lawnmower-like device across a fallen trunk,a lawnmower-like device,bert,b9b377fbe1ef32c6a6962e05205eafe9,What does Buddy do to create toothpicks?,glides a lawnmower-like device across a fallen trunk,gently glides a lawnmower-like device,bert,cea49fd07c75a56c4d4493548922fdf2,What does Buddy do to create toothpicks?,glides a lawnmower-like device across a fallen trunk,glide,bert,8a31d199c0ecc6dca985e2ce4476f2e9,What does Buddy do to create toothpicks?,glides a lawnmower-like device across a fallen trunk,glides a lawnmower-like device,bert,2e518edc6cab5d97880d0d8247023112,What does Buddy do to create toothpicks?,glides a lawnmower-like device across a fallen trunk,saw,bert,cb7697f2bfa5eff5cfce05d46eef290a,What does Buddy drop when he trips?,small logs,an,bert,3ed4f70e14cf02160a9340cb7ee5eae6,What does Buddy drop when he trips?,small logs,an armful of small logs,bert,ed5dfab0fef7c6a8f00a005d21655401,What does Buddy drop when he trips?,small logs,logs,bert,240a88bb13dd9d930bd0939603e6cebe,What does Buddy drop when he trips?,small logs,"the goat rams headfirst into a tree, and gets incapacitated.

"A woman goes into Grand Central Terminal and runs into a black man standing in the middle of the floor. He attempts to help her pick up her belongings, and she protests. This interaction makes her miss her train, and when she leaves the station she can not find her wallet. She makes her way to a cafeteria and takes a salad, and pays for it while informing the waiter that she may not have enough money. After she sits down, she realizes that she has no cutlery, and returns to the service counter for a fork. When she comes back, she finds an African American man who appears to be homeless sitting down and eating a salad. She sits down and informs the man that that is her salad.  He ignores her at first then laughs at her continued protests. She then attempts to take the salad away from him, at which point he slams his fist on the table and yells, frightening her.  She watches him eat for several moments, not sure what else to do.  Finally, the woman grabs her fork and snatches a piece of salad off of the plate. The man does not stop her, and she does it again and again.  The man begins to mimic the way she eats and together they finish the salad.  Afterwards, the man gets up and returns with two cups (assumed to be tea or coffee), and offers her sugar, which she declines. He then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet, which she accepts, opens, and puts in her drink. She brings the cup up to her mouth, but then puts it down and leaves the restaurant. Once outside, she realizes that she does not have her bags. She returns to the cafeteria, and her bags are not in the booth she was sitting in. Anxious, she paces back and forth, not noticing that there are bags in the next cubicle. When she does notice, she sees a salad sitting there, along with her bags.

"A young couple, Brooke and Lance, are injured in a car accident. At the hospital, Brooke is awakened by a nurse named Barb who informs her that Lance has been seriously injured and is in surgery.

"About two layers were laid per shift. Woods' boron trifluoride neutron counter was inserted at the 15th layer. Thereafter, readings were taken at the end of each shift. Fermi divided the square of the radius of the pile by the intensity of the radioactivity to obtain a metric that counted down to one as the pile approached criticality. At the 15th layer, it was 390; at the 19th it was 320; at the 25th it was 270 and by the 36th it was only 149. The original design was for a spherical pile, but as work proceeded, it became clear that this would not be necessary. The new graphite was purer, and 6 short tons (5.4 t) of very pure metallic uranium began to arrive from the Ames Project at Iowa State University, where a team under Frank Spedding had developed a new process to produce uranium metal. Westinghouse Lamp Plant supplied 3 short tons (2.7 t), which it produced in a rush with a makeshift process.The 2.25-inch (5.7 cm) metallic uranium cylinders, known as ""Spedding's eggs"", were dropped in the holes in the graphite in lieu of the uranium oxide pseudospheres. The process of filling the balloon with carbon dioxide would not be necessary, and twenty layers could be dispensed with. According to Fermi's new calculations, the countdown would reach 1 between the 56th and 57th layers. The resulting pile was therefore flatter on the top than on the bottom. Anderson called a halt after the 57th layer was placed. When completed, the wooden frame supported an elliptical-shaped structure, 20 feet (6.1 m) high, 6 feet (1.8 m) wide at the ends and 25 feet (7.6 m) across the middle. It contained 6 short tons (5.4 t) of uranium metal, 50 short tons (45 t) of uranium oxide and 400 short tons (360 t) of graphite, at an estimated cost of $2.7 million.",5d647b620796bc7314b372de27afe7b0,What is the first name of the person who the metallic uranium cylinders were named for?,Frank,"""Spedding's",bert,15ae97e8d8d24b1946b1fd2244fbf897,What is the first name of the person who the metallic uranium cylinders were named for?,Frank,Fermi,bert,ab97c08f449590690899a15a31eae0d6,What is the first name of the person who the metallic uranium cylinders were named for?,Frank,Fermi's,bert,a6f5ee8ef7264fddb87254a64b8a0f40,What is the first name of the person who the metallic uranium cylinders were named for?,Frank,Frank Spedding,bert,bfb4cbeffed8250c82dfc45aa3e99814,What is the first name of the person who the metallic uranium cylinders were named for?,Frank,Spedding,bert,30776ed7ce0254b4fd370841bfb79a4c,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Above the pylon, separated by the cornice, are the three Virtues—from left to right, Faith, Charity, and Hope—in shell niches, separated by four Corinthian fluted pilasters. Such a motif is unprecedented in Tuscan funerary sculpture but found at this date in Venice, Padua, and especially Cossa's native Naples. As a result, excursions to Venice have been suggested for both Michelozzo and Donatello. However, Janson suggests that one ""need not go all the way to Venice"" to find such motifs. Outside Florence, Virtues were common on tombs, with the cardinal Virtues used for laymen, and the theological virtues reserved for ecclesiastics, including the Brancaccio tomb. However, the Cossa Virtues, from their hair to their sandals, are more thoroughly antique. Donatello also produced two similar bronze Virtues for the Siena Baptistry, whose chronological relationship to the Cossa Virtues is unclear.The 1.05-metre (3.44 ft) tall Faith, to the right of Charity, is holding a Eucharistic chalice; the 1.07-metre (3.51 ft) tall Charity is holding a cornucopia and a brazier (or flaming vase); and the 1.06-metre (3.48 ft) tall Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer. The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of Abundantia, Ceres, and Juno, all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands. Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose of the tall yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing the peculiarities of Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the ""immediacy"" of the trope of lying in state, which was otherwise dominant on Quattrocento wall tombs.",97db70c20e7c74a9f05ec44532d32f4a,What is featured on the Brancaccio tomb?,theological virtues,"Charity,",bert,26cbd83a7c5660305c9ffbd4676d015d,What is featured on the Brancaccio tomb?,theological virtues,"Faith,",bert,9ac754650ff275041a5aed47aa016bcd,What is featured on the Brancaccio tomb?,theological virtues,"Faith, Charity,",bert,5ab494036a9c4cdbeed519ee9002e69b,What is featured on the Brancaccio tomb?,theological virtues,"Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer.

"After ""Jingle Bells"" melody, played on a calliope, is heard during the brief opening credits, two children, who appear to be five or six years old, are seen in a bunk bed, saying goodnight to their mother. The boy, Dick, is in the upper bunk and the girl, Ann, who is in the lower bunk, says, ""oh, Dick, I wonder if Santa ever got our letter"".  The visuals become blurry and a male narrator states, ""yes, Ann, far up in the North Pole, Santa is reading your letter now"". In a spacious living room setting, seated in a large easy chair and dressed in full traditional apparel, Santa is holding a sheet of paper which is shown in close-up to depict, in large-lettered children's handwriting, ""Dear Santa / DicK and I would LiKe To visiT You. / CouLD we PLEase visit you at The NoRTH PoLE beFore CHriSTmAs ? / DicK And ANN"". Upon reading the letter, Santa says, ""Why not"" and calls elf Toby to prepare the magic helicopter and bring the two children to him. Toby responds, ""your'all words are my command, Santa"". Appearing in Dick and Ann's bedroom, Toby awakens them with the words, ""hurry up and get dressed and we will fly to Santa"", as the narrator explains to the audience, ""it's just a short hop in the magic helicopter"".  Walking through a castle-style entrance inscribed ""Santa"", Toby leads Dick and Ann into Santa's living room and is then dismissed by Santa who, still seated in his large easy chair, takes the children onto his lap, as documentary footage of seasonal celebrations and Santa pageantry appears on the screen, with the narrator recounting how Christmas is observed in various cities and towns. A Christmas parade, with main focus on Santa, is seen in the Pennsylvania city of McKeesport. Santa gives Dick and Ann a tour of ""The Village Toy Shop"" which appears as a series of Christmas doll and toy exhibits as well as displays in a large department store.

"After causing yet another scandal, Kay Dowling, the spoiled daughter of wealthy New Yorkers, is given a stark choice by her fed-up father, go to his ranch in Ursula, Wyoming, (to avoid being named a co-respondent in a divorce case) or be disinherited. Kay's fiance, Herbert Forrest, proposes getting married immediately, but she chooses the ranch.  Later, while spending her days on the ranch with her good-humored aunt Bessie, Kay falls reluctantly in love with one of her father's cowhands, Tom McNair, and impulsively marries him. When her father learns of the union, he disowns her. Kay and Tom are forced to live in a one-room shack while Tom tries to expand his cattle herd. One year later, Kay is unhappy with life on the ranch, and longs for the comforts of her family's palatial mansion. One day, she receives a telegram from home, and tells Tom that her father is sick and that she must be with him. Back in New York, Kay writes a letter to Tom, asking for a divorce. Soon after, Tom arrives at the estate and explains that he left the ranch to become a professional bronco rider in a rodeo. Kay assumes that he never received the letter, and Tom never mentions it. One night during a party, Tom overhears the guests making fun of him and he tells Kay she can have her divorce. Later, as she realizes that life with Herbert would amount to a life of playing golf, Kay visits Tom at the rodeo. During his performance, he is thrown from a bronco and hurt.

"After graduating from Pacific Night Law School in Los Angeles, feisty and ambitious Mexican American Johnny Ramirez loses his first court case because he is ill-prepared. His poor, Hispanic client's truck was destroyed by careless debutante Dale Elwell. Johnny is harassed by the opposing attorney, uppercrust Brook Manville, who is defending his lover, Elwell. Johnny reacts, losing his temper and the case. Disbarred for his actions, he journeys to a small town south of the border and finds work as a bouncer, in a seedy casino owned by Charlie Roark. Johnny helps transform the dive into a first-class nightclub called the Silver Slipper that attracts an upscale crowd, and Charlie makes him a partner to reward him for his efforts. Charlie's lonely, unhappily married wife Marie makes a play for Johnny, who resists her advances. Certain Johnny has shunned her simply because she is married, she locks her inebriated husband in the garage and leaves the car running, asphyxiating him. Dale Elwell and her society friends, including Brook Manville, visit the club and Johnny becomes infatuated with her. A jealous Marie accuses Johnny of murdering Charlie, but when called to testify at his trial, she collapses on the witness stand, having become insane. Johnny returns to Los Angeles and proposes to Dale, who contemptuously rejects him, citing the dramatic differences in their racial and economic backgrounds, then is hit and killed by a car trying to get away from him.

"After his share in the Farthest South achievement of the Discovery Expedition, Ernest Shackleton suffered a physical collapse on the return journey, and was sent home with the expedition's relief vessel on orders from Scott; he bitterly resented it, and the two became rivals.  Four years later, Shackleton organised his own polar venture, the Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09. This was the first expedition to set the definite objective of reaching the South Pole, and to have a specific strategy for doing so.To assist his endeavour, Shackleton adopted a mixed transport strategy, involving the use of Manchurian ponies as pack animals, as well as the more traditional dog-sledges. A specially adapted motor car was also taken. Although the dogs and the car were used during the expedition for a number of purposes, the task of assisting the group that would undertake the march to the pole fell to the ponies. The size of Shackleton's four-man polar party was dictated by the number of surviving ponies; of the ten that were embarked in New Zealand, only four had survived the 1908 winter.Ernest Shackleton and three companions (Frank Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Adams) began their march on 29 October 1908. On 26 November they surpassed the farthest point reached by Scott's 1902 party. ""A day to remember"", wrote Shackleton in his journal, noting that they had reached this point in far less time than on the previous march with Captain Scott. Shackleton's group continued southward, discovering and ascending the Beardmore Glacier to the polar plateau, and then marching on to reach their Farthest South point at 88°23'S, a mere 97 nautical miles (180 km; 112 mi) from the pole, on 9 January 1909. Here they planted the Union Jack presented to them by Queen Alexandra, and took possession of the plateau in the name of King Edward VII, before shortages of food and supplies forced them to turn back north. This was, at the time, the closest convergence on either pole. The increase of more than six degrees south from Scott's previous record was the greatest extension of Farthest South since Captain Cook's 1773 mark. Shackleton was treated as a hero on his return to England. His record was to stand for less than three years, being passed by Amundsen on 7 December 1911.",d61acc12306df525b80825b71ecfc1c2,What is the first name of the person who adopted a mixed transport strategy?,Ernest,Ernest Shackleton,bert,d87c7c7ae601ecac47c43aee57686244,What is the first name of the person who adopted a mixed transport strategy?,Ernest,"Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09.",bert,5f317948392f069ff5ea1f9f55bf21ba,What is the first name of the person who adopted a mixed transport strategy?,Ernest,"the Nimrod Expedition,",bert,ae8f53f9f292c4ded0ac16664ab0857f,What is the first name of the person who adopted a mixed transport strategy?,Ernest,winter.Ernest,bert,8c91f512407e2d364a369f8c455e901f,What is the first name of the person who set up the first expedition to set the definite objective of reaching the South Pole?,Ernest,Ernest Shackleton,bert,9ce94e15b8da6a1bdcf5b736e2949b90,What is the first name of the person who set up the first expedition to set the definite objective of reaching the South Pole?,Ernest,"Nimrod Expedition,",bert,0edc64f61bf475e30f494e36bac5fe09,What is the first name of the person who set up the first expedition to set the definite objective of reaching the South Pole?,Ernest,winter.Ernest,bert,50c85201eb3a70463a43ce2c21ea692d,What is the first name of the person whose record was to stand for less than three years?,Ernest,(Frank,bert,8b85446db46c19b80a89d7d06040139e,What is the first name of the person whose record was to stand for less than three years?,Ernest,Ernest Shackleton,bert,03d5ea7d6780af824bfb3e7410815cda,What is the first name of the person whose record was to stand for less than three years?,Ernest,"King Edward VII,",bert,738cb4a34377e8b11c9bfdf654dd3843,What is the first name of the person whose record was to stand for less than three years?,Ernest,winter.Ernest,bert,7f713cb95309843b2d94c3c04d6a45c3,What is the first name of the person whose record was to stand for less than three years?,Ernest,winter.Ernest Shackleton and three companions (Frank,bert,b6787fd9542e47c893f5eeb75e3bf73b,What is the last name of the person who broke Ernest's record?,Amundsen,Scott's,bert,76d7abd55ff23826f2767a589d60d725,What is the last name of the person who broke Ernest's record?,Amundsen,Scott;,bert,9ca72c0fccb0ae2d41dd9f7de4c47a0d,What is the last name of the person who broke Ernest's record?,Amundsen,Shackleton,bert,1ece8dc79fec054a605b070ce6ccbf49,What were the last names of the two people who became rivals?,Scott,Ernest Shackleton,bert,1655de7905a19d526fc7bc336e67df4b,What were the last names of the two people who became rivals?,Scott,Shackleton,bert,16c1ded5e0e3ef63e417569525877364,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"After receiving a distress signal, a team of elite commandos are dispatched to extract a scientific team in a secret military base. The team is instructed to shoot on sight any prisoners that they see. When they arrive, the commandos split into three teams. However, team leader Romeo disobeys orders when he recognizes one of the prisoners, Eve, as his dead wife. Confused, Romeo asks how this is possible, but Eve claims to be suffering from amnesia and can only remember bits and pieces of her life. The others dispute this and want to kill her, but Romeo is adamant that she accompany them.  After an encounter with a mutant gorilla, Elvis is killed and tensions begin to rise; the team begin to wonder what kind of experiments could have been performed at the base. When the commandos find lead scientist Caesar, they angrily demand answers, but he tells them only that Eve is a dangerous and important weapon. Matthews, after being threatened, reveals that the prisoners have been used in brain experiments. Eve is distressed by this, and the team remains hostile to the scientists; however, they agree to allow the scientists to accompany them. A friendly team opens fire on them, and a prisoner nearly forces Romeo to open fire on his own team. Fourpack saves Romeo by killing the prisoner. Caesar explains that the prisoners have psychic powers, enhanced through experimentation. Disgusted, the team abandons the scientists and decides to escort Eve to the surface. Wiki hallucinates a dog attack and accidentally kills herself, and the third team opens fire on the remaining soldiers.

"After their HIV positive mother's death, Derick and Margaret collect wood and construct a human-length box with wheels. Then, they journey with it from Kampala to Kasangombe in a heartbreaking bid to overcome poverty and experience hope. The journey throws them dangerous experiences on unpredictable Ugandan roads. Their mother's dying wish had set them off on a seemingly impossible journey to find a relative they do not even know. Before her death, she leaves them an envelope addressed to her sister (their auntie) who is married to a hard-working man living in a distant village called Kasangombe with their kids. Ingeniously, Derick creates a coffin using wood he collected from a rubbish dump and adds luggage bag rollers brought by Margaret. On their journey from Kampala City to their aunt's place, they are offered a lift by a seemingly kind man (played by Joel Okuyo Atiku) in a truck who is amazed by their ""box"". He introduces them to a kid he had taken under his wings relaxing at the back and shows them a photo of a house they can possess if they work for him. At night though, Margaret sees a scary dream where their helper is not exactly as kind as he seemed so she runs out of the truck. Derick follows and the boy throws out their coffin before waving. They walk the rest of the distance. Initially, their uncle (played by Isaac Muwawu) did not want them in his house because he thought they were HIV-infected. Derick overheard him quarrel with his aunt at night and shook Margaret in the morning from another dream (this time beautiful, where both siblings were smiling and enjoying a picnic in a glorious garden with their aunt, uncle, cousins, dead parents and some whites).

"Alex Gates is a wine merchant living in Miami who has distanced himself from his alcoholic wife Suzanne with his philandering, and from his stepson Jason with his indifference. Alex is heavily in debt, and hatches a plan to steal a valuable diamond necklace from the house of his clients, the Reese family, where his Cuban mistress Gabriela works. He cases the house during a wine delivery with Jason, who works in Alex's business, although not happily. Jason becomes attracted to Gabriela, unaware of her relationship with his father. On the day of the heist, Alex and his British safe-cracker partner Victor arrive at the house under the pretense that the Reeses' wine cellar needs repairs, otherwise their wine will be ruined. Gabriela was supposed to let them in, but she was fired the day before. Fortunately, Alex had cultivated a relationship with the security guard and is able to convince him to admit them. Victor sends Alex and the guard off on an errand while he works on the safe, but a second guard becomes suspicious, although Victor is able to complete the job before being discovered. The pair decide that Alex will pawn the necklace in New York City, and he invites Gabriela to go with him. As he is packing, Suzanne chances upon the airline tickets for him and Gabriela and immediately realizes he is having another affair. The two of them get into a physical alteration and she knocks him out. Deciding to leave him, she empties out his suitcase, where he has hidden the necklace, and uses it for her own clothes. Jason walks in and the two of them flee to the Florida Keys. Upon arriving, they discover the necklace, but Suzanne doesn't want to keep it, even after Jason has it appraised, discovering it is worth $1 million. Jason also visits Gabriela back in Miami, giving her the phone number of the place they are staying at.",2ac52e01fcfc42d8c9f5e866f648cb16,What are the first names of the people Gabriela was to let in?,Alex,Alex Gates is a wine merchant living in Miami who has distanced himself from his alcoholic wife Suzanne,bert,c89e47f37ef4ff8d1baca2759a43e73c,What are the first names of the people Gabriela was to let in?,Alex,Alex and his British safe-cracker partner Victor,bert,5560bb3f2c7a6b9abf6f51515a232fab,What are the first names of the people Gabriela was to let in?,Alex,Jason,bert,393ca6984ef4b1caa4c7b0a4f24b1c1a,What are the first names of the people Gabriela was to let in?,Alex,"Jason becomes attracted to Gabriela, unaware of her relationship with his father.

"Almost immediately, the signal began to be misquoted. A number of ships in the fleet recorded the signal as ""England expects every man to do his duty"" (omitting that and replacing will with to). This version became so prevalent that it is recorded on Nelson's tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral. The word that is also omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column, as seen in the photo above. However, the Victory's log and the accounts of signal officer John Pasco and Henry Blackwood (captain of the frigate Euryalus), both present at the preparation of the signal, agree on the form given here. On 26 December 1805, The Times newspaper in London reported the signal as; ""England expects every officer and man to do his duty this day"". In 1811, the tenor John Braham composed a song, ""The Death of Nelson"", including the words of the signal. The song became popular almost immediately and was performed throughout the British Empire during the 19th century. To make the words fit the metre, they were altered to ""England expects that every man this day will do his duty"". This version of the wording is also persistent.Between 1885 and 1908 it was believed that the signal had been sent using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 it was pointed out that this had not been replaced until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags. The signal is still hoisted on the Victory at her dry dock in Portsmouth on Trafalgar Day (21 October) every year, although the signal flags are displayed all at once, running from fore to aft, rather than hoisted sequentially from the mizzenmast.",5b870a50589b58c7a50d57efa39a5bc9,What are the full names of the two people who agree to the form of the signal where that was omitted and will was replaced with to?,John Pasco,Henry Blackwood,bert,81753079fd0adab22dbea0f428e41d08,What are the full names of the two people who agree to the form of the signal where that was omitted and will was replaced with to?,John Pasco,John Pasco and Henry Blackwood,bert,f0d45bd5d08a8018baddc463abec82ac,What are the full names of the two people who agree to the form of the signal where that was omitted and will was replaced with to?,John Pasco,the Victory's log,bert,ba29862d4c44d087448434b08b78de91,What are the full names of the two people who agree to the form of the signal where that was omitted and will was replaced with to?,John Pasco,the Victory's log and the accounts of signal officer John Pasco,bert,f2376bdef4bea476bedb263805c4d680,What are the full names of the two people who agree to the form of the signal where that was omitted and will was replaced with to?,John Pasco,the accounts of signal officer John Pasco,bert,328495a1bba548ee949e101c5d00d00e,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"""",bert,121813db7174d2794ab125bff31560cf,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"""England expects every man to do his duty""",bert,fb360b28a2efe360887558cfb5102d24,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"""England expects every man to do his duty"" (omitting that",bert,6889beed4a4cad1d6146cbdfdc745a95,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"""England expects every man to do his duty"" (omitting that and replacing will with to).",bert,65a42dc5be7b018685fbfd933692aaab,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"the signal as ""England expects every man to do his duty""",bert,9443e6e303ef56fc56a45b2ef82087c8,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,will with to,bert,df4550e8e42a0576579599dfe32f8781,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Although its commercial impact was lessened by the ongoing success of the parent album, ""Something"" / ""Come Together"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 27 October. During the single's chart run on Billboard in the US, ""Something"" peaked at number 3 until the magazine changed its practice of counting sales and airplay separately for each song; following this change on 29 November, the single topped the Billboard Hot 100, for one week. ""Come Together"" / ""Something"" became the Beatles' eighteenth number 1 single in Billboard, surpassing Elvis Presley's record of seventeen. In the other US national charts, Record World listed ""Something"" / ""Come Together"" at number 1 for two weeks and ""Come Together"" / ""Something"" for the remaining three weeks at number 1, while in Cash Box magazine, which continued to rank each song separately, ""Something"" peaked at number 2 and ""Come Together"" spent three weeks at number 1.As the preferred side, ""Something"" was number 1 in Canada (for five weeks), Australia (five weeks), West Germany (two weeks), New Zealand and Singapore. The combined sides reached number 4 in Britain. There, the release was highly unusual, given the traditional preference for non-album singles. In addition, according to former Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer, ""so enormous were sales of Abbey Road that demand for the single was inevitably dampened.""On 17 February 1999, ""Something"" was certified double Platinum by the RIAA. In its 2014 list titled ""The Beatles' 50 Biggest Billboard Hits"", Billboard places the double A-side single in sixth place, immediately after ""Let It Be"" and ahead of ""Hello, Goodbye"". Additionally, ""Something"" is placed again at number 30, representing the song's performance before the November 1969 Hot 100 rule change.",26807368f15b98d05977bb0291587bed,Which magazine changed its practice of counting sales and airplay separately?,Billboard,Cash Box,bert,e77d1059f170fbfd414afdb16c2b9789,Which magazine changed its practice of counting sales and airplay separately?,Billboard,"Cash Box magazine,",bert,0d0f0d348345f30adc48bea887fd1c2b,Which magazine changed its practice of counting sales and airplay separately?,Billboard,Mojo,bert,b5ce5704b4c76aa0a4080a9d8b2853ab,Which magazine changed its practice of counting sales and airplay separately?,Billboard,Recording Industry Association of America,bert,3f296c1d1784ced7c7148e8fd9c3fd1c,Which magazine changed its practice of counting sales and airplay separately?,Billboard,Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 27 October.

"American sailor David Martens, on shore leave in England, visits his brother Jack's grave. He meets fashion designer Sally Meadows, who by coincidence works with Jack's ex-fiancée, Diana, a model. Successful stylist Kingsley Beauchamp and financial backer Madame Dupont own the company where Sally and Diana are employed. Expensive jewels are to be worn by Diana when she models a new dress, but Beauchamp hires two men, Costard and Podd, to break into a safe after hours and steal the gems. Diana stumbles on the robbery and Costard kills her. He knocks David unconscious and decides to frame him for the theft, crashing a car with David inside, reporting it stolen and placing a ruby bracelet in David's pocket. While the police make David a prime suspect, Beauchamp and Costard dispose of Diana's body and the diamonds. They decide to murder David after he suspects them, using gas, but Sally saves him. Diana's body is found in a river. David goes to Beauchamp's home and discovers the missing dress worn by Diana. He knows that Beauchamp is about to fly to Amsterdam, so he hurries to the airport.

"An Army-OSRD council on 25 June 1942 decided to build a pilot plant for plutonium production in Red Gate Woods southwest of Chicago. In July, Nichols arranged for a lease of 1,025 acres (415 ha) from the Cook County Forest Preserve District, and Captain James F. Grafton was appointed Chicago area engineer. It soon became apparent that the scale of operations was too great for the area, and it was decided to build the plant at Oak Ridge, and keep a research and testing facility in Chicago.Delays in establishing the plant in Red Gate Woods led Compton to authorize the Metallurgical Laboratory to construct the first nuclear reactor beneath the bleachers of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. The reactor required an enormous amount of graphite blocks and uranium pellets. At the time, there was a limited source of pure uranium. Frank Spedding of Iowa State University were able to produce only two short tons of pure uranium. Additional three short tons of uranium metal was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant which was produced in a rush with makeshift process. A large square balloon was constructed by Goodyear Tire to encase the reactor. On 2 December 1942, a team led by Enrico Fermi initiated the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as Chicago Pile-1. The point at which a reaction becomes self-sustaining became known as ""going critical"". Compton reported the success to Conant in Washington, D.C., by a coded phone call, saying, ""The Italian navigator [Fermi] has just landed in the new world.""In January 1943, Grafton's successor, Major Arthur V. Peterson, ordered Chicago Pile-1 dismantled and reassembled at Red Gate Woods, as he regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area. At the Argonne site, Chicago Pile-3, the first heavy water reactor, went critical on 15 May 1944. After the war, the operations that remained at Red Gate moved to the new site of the Argonne National Laboratory about 6 miles (9.7 km) away.",b561a55dcaf110fd2dccb2fb46a4b3d1,What is the first name of the person who regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area?,Arthur,Arthur V.,bert,02a046a701a4f8c4e3bb5a53703443dd,What is the first name of the person who regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area?,Arthur,Enrico,bert,a834c76d8fdf226dcf0571b3c7667c86,What is the first name of the person who regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area?,Arthur,James,bert,042c84e9b534d44a93f97a4fe69de913,What is the first name of the person who regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area?,Arthur,Major Arthur,bert,eab2132537e6ac9675da9a0a70c07d6b,What is the first name of the person who regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area?,Arthur,"[Fermi] has just landed in the new world.""In January 1943, Grafton's successor, Major Arthur",bert,cd7f15cabc8e73ab71371220c760e96e,What is the full name of the person who replaced James?,Major Arthur V.

"Apart from the large decorative elements, carved friezes and mosaics which were left in situ, many artifacts were recovered and moved from the Eshmun Temple to the national museum, the Louvre or are in possession of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities. Some of these smaller finds include a collection of inscribed ostraca unearthed by Dunand providing rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing in the Phoenician mainland. One of the recovered ostracon bears the theophoric Phoenician name ""grtnt"" which suggests that veneration of the lunar-goddess Tanit occurred in Sidon.A number of fragmented votive life-size sculptures of little children lying on their side and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among the best known of these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A31.5 cm × 27 cm (12.4 in × 10.6 in) limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6th century BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.Among the notable finds is a golden plaque showing a snake curling on a staff, a Hellenic symbol of Eshmun. and a granite altar bearing the name of Egyptian Pharaoh Achoris uncovered in the Eshmun sanctuary. This gift attests to the good relations between the Pharaoh and the kings of Sidon.The repute of the sanctuary was far reaching. Cypriot pilgrims from Paphos left marks of their devotion for Astarte on a marble stele inscribed both in Greek and Cypriot syllabary at Astarte's shrine; this stele is now in the custody of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities.",c6341e19d687d21615d99e0c18d63286,In what place was the rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing found?,Eshmun Temple,Eshmun,bert,855bc171f1a1fb3c01e814e1c19cf043,In what place was the rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing found?,Eshmun Temple,Sidon.A,bert,da7e556b67a867865e7ec23b5b172677,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Archie Moses is a small-time thief in Los Angeles who smuggles drugs for drug lord Frank Colton, who launders his drug money through a car dealership. Moses is unaware that his best friend, Rock Keats, is actually LAPD undercover cop Jack Carter, who befriended him only to infiltrate Colton's gang. Carter has Moses include him in Colton's next drug shipment, secretly planning to arrest Colton and take in Moses, whom he has come to care about, unharmed. Carter's undercover status is revealed before he can enact his plan, however, and a hurt Moses pulls a gun on him.

"Arthur Harris is the grumpy husband of Marion, who is terminally ill yet continues to participate with enthusiasm at her local seniors' choir, The OAP'Z. The choirmaster is a young teacher, Elizabeth who is preparing the choir to enter a local musical choir competition called ""Shadow Song"". Arthur is also estranged from his son, James. Marion's health deteriorates over time until one night when she dies in her sleep. Arthur initially takes this loss severely and cuts himself from his family and the choir. Eventually he agrees to take Marion's place in the choir. The transition proves to be a challenge for Arthur thanks to the unconventional songbook that includes racier songs such as Salt-N-Pepa's ""Let's Talk About Sex"" and Motorhead's ""Ace of Spades"". However he grows to enjoy spending time in the choir. On the eve of the competition, Arthur has an argument with James in a failed attempt to rebuild their relationship and pulls out of the choir. The choir participates in the competition without Arthur. He arrives later but before he can perform with the choir, they are eliminated from the competition by the judges. The choir are on their way to return home in defeat when Arthur stops the bus and storms the musical competition's stage shortly joined by the rest of the choir. They perform again with Arthur singing a solo of ""Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)"". The choir finishes in third place and returns home triumphant.

"As of 2013, Ratanakiri Province had a population of approximately 184,000. Its population nearly doubled between 1998 and 2013, largely due to internal migration. In 2013, Ratanakiri made up 1.3% of Cambodia's total population; its population density of 17.0 residents per square kilometer was just over one fifth the national average. About 70% of the province's population lives in the highlands; of the other 30%, approximately half live in more urbanized towns, and half live along rivers and in the lowlands, where they practice wetland rice cultivation and engage in market activities. Banlung, the provincial capital located in the central highlands, is by far the province's largest town, with a population of approximately 25,000. Other significant towns include Veun Sai in the north and Lomphat in the south, with populations of 2,000 and 3,000 respectively.In 2013, 37% of Ratanakiri residents were under age 15, 52% were age 15 to 49, 7% were age 50 to 64, and 3% were aged 65 or older; 49.7% of residents were male, and 50.3% were female. Each household had an average of 4.9 members, and most households (85.6%) were headed by men.While highland peoples have inhabited Ratanakiri for well over a millennium, lowland peoples have migrated to the province in the last 200 years. As of 2013, various highland groups collectively called Khmer Loeu made up approximately half of Ratanakiri's population, ethnic Khmers made up 36%, and ethnic Lao made up 10%. Within the Khmer Loeu population, 35% were Tampuan as of 1998, 24% were Jarai, 23% were Kreung, 11% were Brou, 3% were Kachok, and 3% were Kavet, with other groups making up the remaining one percent. There are also very small Vietnamese, Cham, and Chinese minorities.  Though the official language of Ratanakiri (like all of Cambodia) is Khmer, each indigenous group speaks its own language. Less than 10% of Ratanakiri's indigenous population can speak Khmer fluently.",6d321034eb3fb2af4ec62d6b39fe52a1,What is the largest demographic bracket in Ratanakiri Province?,15 to 49,Khmer,bert,c4cacc0c6ce1cba4b998ff9639273466,What is the largest demographic bracket in Ratanakiri Province?,15 to 49,Khmer Loeu,bert,4ad54f33c696e9eb69be80acaee5d900,What is the largest demographic bracket in Ratanakiri Province?,15 to 49,"Khmer, each indigenous group speaks its own language.

"As the 19th century progressed, the United States government's Indian removal policy pushed Native American tribes west of the Mississippi River.  In 1830, the Indian Removal Act was signed into law, and though that act did not directly address the Potawatomi people of Indiana, it led to several additional treaties that resulted in their removal.  In what came to be known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death, about 860 Potawatomi Indians who had refused to leave were forced to move from Indiana to Kansas.  On September 14, 1838, the group camped near Williamsport, and on September 15 they camped in the southwestern part of the county before moving into Illinois.  Before reaching their destination in Kansas, over 40 of them had died, many of them children; two children died and were buried at the second Warren County campsite.When the county was established, the Wabash River was vital to transportation and shipping.  Zachariah Cicott traded up and down the river, and cities like Attica, Perrysville, Baltimore and Williamsport were founded near the river's banks and flourished because of it.  In the 1840s, the Wabash and Erie Canal began to operate and provided even broader shipping opportunities, but the canal favored towns which were on the ""right side"" of the river; the canal was on the Fountain County side, and towns like Baltimore dwindled as a result.  Some towns, such as Williamsport and Perrysville, managed to participate in canal traffic through the use of side-cuts that brought traffic from the canal across the river.  When railroads were constructed starting in the 1850s, they in turn began to render the canals obsolete and allowed trade to reach towns that lacked water connections.  The canal continued to be used through the early 1870s.",34fad4462ce78431e11b4f54470563c8,What decade did the canals that provided broader shipping opportunities start to decline due to railroads?,1850s,1840s,bert,b490ee2a1cd8c1003db7cd5265479efc,What decade did the canals that provided broader shipping opportunities start to decline due to railroads?,1850s,"1840s, the Wabash and Erie Canal",bert,e910b44a10b97111c54ce19a0907d658,What decade did the canals that provided broader shipping opportunities start to decline due to railroads?,1850s,1870s,bert,9a9ba1a78b5909a1792b479ed1eabff9,What decade did the canals that provided broader shipping opportunities start to decline due to railroads?,1850s,Wabash and Erie Canal,bert,58f0f104188874a83885cf1256ad12ca,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"As the British fleet closed with the opposing combined fleets of France and Spain, Lord Nelson signalled all the necessary battle instructions to his ships. Aware of the momentousness of events to come, Lord Nelson felt that something extra was required. He instructed his signal officer, Lieutenant John Pasco, to signal to the fleet, as quickly as possible, the message ""England confides that every man will do his duty."" Pasco suggested to Nelson that expects be substituted for confides (i.e. is confident), since the former word was in the signal book, whereas confides would have to be spelt out letter-by-letter. Nelson agreed to the change (even though it produced a less trusting impression): His Lordship came to me on the poop, and after ordering certain signals to be made, about a quarter to noon, he said, 'Mr. Pasco, I wish to say to the fleet, ENGLAND CONFIDES THAT EVERY MAN WILL DO HIS DUTY' and he added 'You must be quick, for I have one more to make which is for close action.' I replied, 'If your Lordship will permit me to substitute the confides for expects the signal will soon be completed, because the word expects is in the vocabulary, and confides must be spelt,' His Lordship replied, in haste, and with seeming satisfaction, 'That will do, Pasco, make it directly.' Thus, at around 11:45 a.m. on 21 October 1805, the signal was sent.

"As three US servicemen – Marine Private First Class Ira Hayes, Private First Class Rene Gagnon, and Navy Corpsman John ""Doc"" Bradley – are feted as heroes in a war bond drive, they reflect on their experiences via flashback. After training at Camp Tarawa in Hawaii, the 28th Marine Regiment 5th Marine Division sails to invade Iwo Jima. The Navy bombards suspected Japanese positions for three days. Sergeant Mike Strank is put in charge of Second Platoon. The next day, February 19, 1945, the Marines land in Higgins boats and LVTs. The beaches are silent and Private First Class Ralph ""Iggy"" Ignatowski wonders if the defenders are all dead before Japanese heavy artillery and machine guns open fire on the advancing Marines and the Navy ships. Casualties are heavy, but the beaches are secured. Two days later, the Marines attack Mount Suribachi under a rain of Japanese artillery and machine gun fire, as the Navy bombards the mountain. Doc saves the lives of several Marines under fire, which later earns him the Navy Cross. The mountain is eventually secured. On February 23, the platoon under command of Sergeant Hank Hansen reaches the top of Mount Suribachi and hoists the United States flag to cheers from the beaches and the ships. Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, who witnesses the flag raising as he lands on the beach, requests the flag for himself. Colonel Chandler Johnson decides his 2nd Battalion deserves the flag more. Rene is sent up with Second Platoon to replace the first flag with a second one for Forrestal to take. Mike, Doc, Ira, Rene, and two other Marines (Corporal Harlon Block and Private First Class Franklin Sousley) are photographed by Joe Rosenthal as they raise the second flag. On March 1, the Second Platoon is ambushed from a Japanese machine gun nest. During the fight over the nest, Mike is hit by a U.S. Navy shell and dies from his wounds. Later that day, Hank is shot in the chest and dies, and Harlon is killed by machine gun fire.",2f4a0bd6edf5888dfb4b864832ddc49c,What are the full names of the men who raise the second flag on Mount Suribachi?,Ira Hayes,(Corporal Harlon Block,bert,1bb3eb6625d53353f31a3ea11768cc13,What are the full names of the men who raise the second flag on Mount Suribachi?,Ira Hayes,(Corporal Harlon Block and Private First Class Franklin Sousley),bert,687255716ccce780ab41cf6c22dfb425,What are the full names of the men who raise the second flag on Mount Suribachi?,Ira Hayes,Harlon Block,bert,553d350f02e04aab4ad281837d72e54e,What are the full names of the men who raise the second flag on Mount Suribachi?,Ira Hayes,"Mike,",bert,370a057225c6421d25ab815acca475fd,What are the full names of the men who raise the second flag on Mount Suribachi?,Ira Hayes,"Mike, Doc, Ira, Rene, and two other Marines (Corporal Harlon Block",bert,16e7403ee0757ffc56f1078a0d4239d7,What are the full names of the men who raise the second flag on Mount Suribachi?,Ira Hayes,Sergeant Hank Hansen,bert,b5c335513a3defe3a1a0291093cc5ff1,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"At 51°17′4.2″N 0°41′44.2″E, the village is in central Kent, approximately 38 miles (61 km) south-east of London. The nearest town is Sittingbourne, 4 miles (6 km) to the north. Wormshill is surrounded by villages and hamlets of a similar size, including Frinsted, Bicknor, Bedmonton and Hucking. The village is on a high point of the North Downs. The nearby road intersection of Black Post is recorded on the Ordnance Survey maps at 191 metres (627 ft) above sea level. The landscape is primarily characterised by undulating calcareous grassland and ancient deciduous woodland over chalk downland. The settlement itself (as opposed to the wider parish) is on a downland ridge between two shallow dip slope valleys that separate it from Bicknor to the north-west and Frinsted to the east. Wormshill's elevated and exposed position on the North Downs means it occasionally experiences extreme weather conditions such as the heavy snowfalls of 11–14 January 1987, March 2005, February 2009 and January 2010. In the late 18th century Hasted commented: ""Being exposed to the northern aspect, it lies very bleak and cold.""Much of the local woodland was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds. A significant part of the exposed woodland to the north-east of Wormshill was felled and, after replanting, has only recently shown signs of maturing. An ancient yew tree believed to have stood for several hundred years in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long-standing trees. However, some 25 years later, the village displays few obvious signs of the damage.",59035de875103542ce9587932100cef8,"What is the name of the village in central Kent, approximately 38 miles south-east of London?",Wormshill,Bicknor,bert,224cb90dcabdf07865b284fc303bbf00,"What is the name of the village in central Kent, approximately 38 miles south-east of London?",Wormshill,Bicknor to the north-west and Frinsted to the east.

"At a jousting tournament in 14th-century Europe, young squires William Thatcher, Roland, and Wat discover that their master, Sir Ector, has died. If he had completed one final pass he would have won the tournament. Destitute, William wears Ector's armour to impersonate him, winning the tournament and taking the prize. Although only nobles are allowed in tournaments, William is now inspired to compete and win more prizes. Roland and Wat would rather take their winnings and leave, but William convinces them to stay and train him to joust. Along the way to his first tournament in Rouen, the trio encounters a young Geoffrey Chaucer, who is also destitute and agrees to forge the patent of nobility that will allow William to enter under the assumed name of ""Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein"" from Gelderland. At the tournament, William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment. In the course of competition, William's armor is damaged very badly. He goads Kate, a blacksmith, to repair it without payment and goes on to win the tournament's sword event. In the joust, he faces Sir Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honor of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust, Adhemar defeats William. At the prize ceremony, William vows revenge on Adhemar who then taunts William by telling him that he has been weighed, measured and found wanting. William then uses some of his winnings from the sword event to pay off Chaucer's debt.",58dac260ee1b994d6126afe71678cd89,Which people encounter Geoffrey Chaucer?,Roland,"Thatcher,",bert,09bdf010215d481a0867da16a5b40d4a,Which people encounter Geoffrey Chaucer?,Roland,William,bert,5b6957fd5451d52a3a9f4cd8bb75445b,Which people encounter Geoffrey Chaucer?,Roland,"William Thatcher,",bert,3631681daa9589f4f589a5c0b7ea0307,Which people encounter Geoffrey Chaucer?,Roland,"William Thatcher, Roland,",bert,6f9e81e444fa22133a875d017ef249bb,Which people encounter Geoffrey Chaucer?,Roland,"squires William Thatcher,",bert,1350e38e9c1a2c11f8b0df06f8556936,Who faces Sir Thomas Colville in a joust?,William,Chaucer,bert,2d7d6246950a13e429d66b363c13ae0e,Who faces Sir Thomas Colville in a joust?,William,Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt.

"At the time of the Kent Hundred Rolls in 1275, Wormshill was in the Hundred of Eyhorne, a regional sub-division used in the Middle Ages by feudal and crown officials to administer communities. Although the Hundred of Eyhorne (including Wormshill) still exists, it is a mediaeval anachronism and no longer has any practical or administrative significance. In the 19th century, the village was within the lathe of Aylesford, the Bearsted petty sessional division and the Hollingbourne Rural District. The village was also incorporated into the Hollingbourne Poor Law Union (a means of funding and administering the operation of the Poor Laws in the area). The parish of Wormshill in part sits astride the West Kent and East Kent divide, a demarcation which until 1814 applied to an administrative boundary for the purposes of the law courts' Quarter Sessions. According to Edward Hasted (writing in 1798): ""northward of the church, including the borough of Bedmanton, is in the division of East Kent, but the rest of it, including the church and village, is in that of West Kent"". This differs from the traditional distinction between Men of Kent and Kentish Men, which are separated by the River Medway, accordingly persons born in Wormshill would be Men of Kent.Since 1975, Wormshill has been administered within the North Downs ward and, together with surrounding communities, elects a representative councillor for the ward in the Borough of Maidstone. The incumbent councillor for the North Downs ward is Patrik Garten. The village forms the central focus of the civil and church parishes of Wormshill. The parish chairman is Simon Bass. Wormshill is part of the parliamentary constituency of Faversham and Mid Kent, whose Member of Parliament is Helen Whately of the Conservative Party. It is also in the South East England constituency in the European Parliament.",480f397bd3d7c393e54e9e7e0151961a,What village was within the lathe of Aylesford in the 19th century?,Hundred of Eyhorne,Eyhorne,bert,93a75e10ea743f8ce1461ed15dea38d9,What village was within the lathe of Aylesford in the 19th century?,Hundred of Eyhorne,Eyhorne (including Wormshill),bert,2a3b500eaceb64c5274c6bf94dc41750,What village was within the lathe of Aylesford in the 19th century?,Hundred of Eyhorne,Wormshill,bert,2c327193778170d1b1e8d4c771bce16b,What village was within the lathe of Aylesford in the 19th century?,Hundred of Eyhorne,"Wormshill would be Men of Kent.Since 1975, Wormshill",bert,2c214f9e3d4945b1dc9fc63bbda84958,What village was within the lathe of Aylesford in the 19th century?,Hundred of Eyhorne,Wormshill.

"Audrey Alston encouraged Britten to go to symphony concerts in Norwich. At one of these, during the triennial Norfolk and Norwich Festival in October 1924,  he heard Frank Bridge's orchestral poem The Sea, conducted by the composer. It was the first substantial piece of modern music he had ever encountered, and he was, in his own phrase, ""knocked sideways"" by it. Audrey Alston was a friend of Bridge; when he returned to Norwich for the next festival in 1927 she brought her not quite 14-year-old pupil to meet him. Bridge was impressed with the boy, and after they had gone through some of Britten's compositions together he invited him to come to London to take lessons from him. Robert Britten, supported by Thomas Sewell, doubted the wisdom of pursuing a composing career; a compromise was agreed by which Britten would, as planned, go on to his public school the following year but would make regular day-trips to London to study composition with Bridge and piano with his colleague Harold Samuel.Bridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing and the maxim that ""you should find yourself and be true to what you found."" The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the Quatre Chansons Françaises, a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. Humphrey Carpenter and Michael Oliver judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught; Donald Mitchell considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle.",880dce2228a5dd893452d532f67e5038,What is the first name of the person Alston encouraged to go to symphony concerts?,Robert,Audrey,bert,1576c307cb88fc99fef0c9b7f0c320d6,What is the first name of the person Alston encouraged to go to symphony concerts?,Robert,Audrey Alston encouraged Britten,bert,c251d0937dfbce2321316ec82e930bb0,What is the first name of the person Alston encouraged to go to symphony concerts?,Robert,Frank,bert,b2e68d841c0b138cf30dbac9443adfe2,What is the first name of the person who had gone through some of Britten's compositions?,Frank,14-year-old pupil to meet him.

"Barry Gabrewski is an asthmatic boy who lives with his widowed father, Jerry Gabrewski, in Houston, Texas. A loner, Barry has vivid daydreams about being Chuck Norris' sidekick, battling against Norris's movie enemies, who are often personified by Barry's everyday bullies such as Randy Cellini. Noreen Chan, his favorite teacher, often plays the damsel in distress in these daydreams. Barry wants to learn the martial arts, but is rejected by the arrogant dojo owner Kelly Stone for being too weak. Instead, he is taken on as a student by an old Chinese man called Mr. Lee, Noreen's sly uncle and the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, ""Frying Dragon"". Mr. Lee finds creative ways to teach Barry to defend himself from his bullies. Lee devises training methods that increase Barry's endurance, which helps his asthma. Lee also deduces Barry's hero worship of Norris, and from that at least some of Barry's daydreams. He creatively incorporates this into Barry's training, creating training scenarios that seem more dangerous than they are so that Barry will feel heroic for succeeding at them.

"Bean Bunny wishes he could help with the preparations for the Bunny Picnic, but he is told by his older brother Lugsy that he is too small and will only get in the way. Feeling very disappointed, Bean wanders off alone into the lettuce patch, where he imagines himself as the king of the bunny picnic and community and then encounters a farmer's dog, who chases him around the patch. Bean runs away and escapes the dog and warns the village, but none of the other bunnies believe him. They conclude that there is no dog and that Bean is simply making up the story for attention. At first, it seems that the farmer's dog is the story antagonist, but it is revealed that it is his master the farmer that wants him to get the bunnies for his stew. The dog is only trying to protect himself from the wrath of the farmer by hunting the bunnies. The bunnies soon discover that the dog is indeed real and out to get them. After much debating and futile attempts to rid themselves of the farmer's dog, the bunnies finally listen to Bean, who seems to have a solution to their problem. Inspired by a story about a giant hedgehog, they all hide inside of a giant bunny costume to frighten the dog, except Lugsy who went out for a sleeping potion only to get captured by the dog. The dog, being threatened by the farmer to catch the rabbits or starve, sets out to pursue the bunnies. When he enters their village he is confronted by the ""Giant Bunny"".

"Before the outbreak of the  Second World War  in September 1939, Tippett released two further works: the Piano Sonata No. 1, first performed by Phyllis Sellick at the Queen Mary Hall, London, on 11 November 1938, and  the Concerto for Double String Orchestra, which was not performed until 1940. In a climate of increasing political and military tension, Tippett's compositional efforts were overwhelmed by an emotional crisis. When his relationship with Franks ended acrimoniously in August 1938 he was thrown into doubt and confusion about both his homosexuality and his worth as an artist. He was saved from despair when, at Ayerst's suggestion, he undertook a course of Jungian analysis with the psychotherapist John Layard. Through an extended course of therapy, Layard provided Tippett with the means to analyse and interpret his dreams. Tippett's biographer Ian Kemp describes this experience as ""the major turning point in [his] life"", both emotionally and artistically. His particular discovery from dream analysis was ""the Jungian 'shadow' and 'light' in the single, individual psyche ... the need for the individual to accept his divided nature and profit from its conflicting demands"". This brought him to terms with his homosexuality, and he was able to pursue his creativity without being distracted by personal relationships. While still unsure of his sexuality, Tippett had considered marriage with Francesca Allinson, who had expressed the wish that they should have children together. After his psychotherapy  he enjoyed several committed—and sometimes overlapping—same-sex relationships. Among the most enduring, and most tempestuous, was that with the artist Karl Hawker, whom he first met in 1941.",a3a7fec8b2059fbbabc4563df01ed93e,What is the name of the person that had their relationship with Franks end in 1938?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,264800203d3dc7242dc47070e7eff77d,What is the name of the person that was in doubt and confusion in their worth of an artist?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,4f04c456e787aae3f719fc0132ffea4b,What was the name of the person that had a same-sex relationship with Karl Hawker?,Tippett,"Tippett had considered marriage with Francesca Allinson,",bert,4f3f4fa153343bb0857a8ec25bda721c,What was the name of the person that had a same-sex relationship with Karl Hawker?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,6e1ee52c57ed3f6de1b0c135ad77530a,Which is the name of the person that was in doubt and confusion about their homosexuality?,Tippett,Tippett with the means to analyse and interpret his dreams.

"Bernard Lawrence is an American journalist stationed in Paris, France. A playboy, he has devised an ingenious system for juggling three different girlfriends: by dating stewardesses who are assigned to international routes on non-intersecting flight schedules, only one woman is in the country at any given time. He has their comings and goings timetabled with such precision that he can drop off his British United Airways girlfriend for her outgoing flight and pick up his inbound Lufthansa girlfriend on the very same trip to the airport—while his Air France girlfriend is in a holding pattern elsewhere. With help from his long-suffering housekeeper Bertha (Thelma Ritter)—who swaps the appropriate photos and food in and out of the apartment to match the incoming girlfriend—none of the ladies is aware of each other's presence in the apartment. They regard Lawrence's flat as their ""home"" during their Paris layovers. Bernard is so happy with his life in Paris that he intends to turn down an imminent promotion that would require him to move to New York City. Bernard's life is turned upside down when his girlfriends' airlines begin putting new, state-of-the-art aircraft into service. These faster airplanes change all of the existing route schedules and allow the stewardesses to spend more time in Paris. Most alarming for Bernard, his three girlfriends will now all be in Paris at the same time. Robert Reed, a fellow journalist and an old acquaintance, complicates Bernard's life even further when he arrives in town and is unable to find a hotel room.

"Bernard Lawrence is an American journalist stationed in Paris, France. A playboy, he has devised an ingenious system for juggling three different girlfriends: by dating stewardesses who are assigned to international routes on non-intersecting flight schedules, only one woman is in the country at any given time. He has their comings and goings timetabled with such precision that he can drop off his British United Airways girlfriend for her outgoing flight and pick up his inbound Lufthansa girlfriend on the very same trip to the airport—while his Air France girlfriend is in a holding pattern elsewhere. With help from his long-suffering housekeeper Bertha (Thelma Ritter)—who swaps the appropriate photos and food in and out of the apartment to match the incoming girlfriend—none of the ladies is aware of each other's presence in the apartment. They regard Lawrence's flat as their ""home"" during their Paris layovers. Bernard is so happy with his life in Paris that he intends to turn down an imminent promotion that would require him to move to New York City. Bernard's life is turned upside down when his girlfriends' airlines begin putting new, state-of-the-art aircraft into service. These faster airplanes change all of the existing route schedules and allow the stewardesses to spend more time in Paris. Most alarming for Bernard, his three girlfriends will now all be in Paris at the same time. Robert Reed, a fellow journalist and an old acquaintance, complicates Bernard's life even further when he arrives in town and is unable to find a hotel room. He insists on staying in Bernard's apartment for a few days. When he sees Bernard's living situation, he schemes to take over Bernard's apartment, his girls, his housekeeper, and Bernard's Paris job while manipulating him into taking the new job in New York.",0e920bee8fcb4734398498d531a3f6ac,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's Paris job?,Robert Reed,"Reed,",bert,74d661632bde05d1055a0ef9ce762b56,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's Paris job?,Robert Reed,Robert,bert,9c1c3e255f4fa65457114c3755d7d8e5,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's apartment?,Robert Reed,Bernard,bert,04d7ce65601044c98250af2d4138a035,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's apartment?,Robert Reed,Bernard Lawrence,bert,767b5e51d149b2c5c45861c287856f42,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's apartment?,Robert Reed,Lawrence,bert,f68f72fd01d5803f871594acfa8ae2d8,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's apartment?,Robert Reed,"Reed,",bert,99b107ed8fcf67cd4e0253f3e1913add,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's apartment?,Robert Reed,Robert,bert,1c530d7d5ce5f8b421db86005600e8bb,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's girls?,Robert Reed,Bernard,bert,0a87fa883ded677f567fcaee017bd747,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's girls?,Robert Reed,Bernard Lawrence,bert,047be5d40f458e839032633a9f9eb5d7,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's girls?,Robert Reed,Lawrence,bert,6edcd4a7b944dfcc1970326ab2562700,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's girls?,Robert Reed,"Reed,",bert,80ae780209c95b45eab3f816fbacabc9,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's girls?,Robert Reed,Robert,bert,df0d9126bc656687236d7a65988d946a,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's housekeeper?,Robert Reed,Bernard,bert,c00d400601b7658d9c6166972ab1a597,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's housekeeper?,Robert Reed,Bernard Lawrence,bert,cb9b64d7cfee69379669b79dbc92d2f7,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's housekeeper?,Robert Reed,Lawrence,bert,fd8b3b03eb8840ac47bd2ef07cc37980,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's housekeeper?,Robert Reed,"Reed,",bert,dcc5d62e39e0dbbe3deace3a01fea128,What is the full name of the person who schemes to take over someone's housekeeper?,Robert Reed,Robert,bert,9bdb3306fdc8d977bab2d09c6dafa50e,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Biker Queen, twin sister of Harley Mom, discovers the severed arm of her sister from the previous film. Upon discovering the surviving Bartender, she tortures him into telling her who killed Harley Mom. He reveals that it was Bozo and points her to a town where he lives. She knocks Bartender out and takes him with her to the town. Prior to the events of the first film, the town was overrun by the monsters. A pair of small Mexican wrestlers named Thunder and Lightning were attacked by the monsters and Lightning's girlfriend was killed. Inside the jail, a ""Hobo"" was in a cell for dealing methamphetamine and questioned where his school bus (makeshift meth lab) is at. The Sheriff taunted him before being killed. A car salesman named Slasher found evidence of his wife cheating with one of his employees and barely escaped the monsters. Biker Queen and four of her friends arrive in the deserted town with the Bartender, ignoring the dead bodies as they look for Bozo and cross paths with Slasher, his wife Secrets and the man she has an affair with, Greg. The group is attacked by a monster, which kills one of the biker girls, Tot Girl. The others and the Bartender make their way to Bozo's apartment, where they encounter Honey Pie, the girl who left the group from the first movie behind at the bar. Bartender brutally attacks her and knocks Honey Pie out of the window and onto the street. Honey Pie survives the fall and goes into hiding. Slasher, Greg and Secrets receive a call from the wrestlers, but before they find them they are ambushed by the bikers.

"Bloc Party confirmed a preliminary track list of 13 songs in August 2006; this included future bonus tracks ""England"" and ""We Were Lovers"". A low-quality rip of A Weekend in the City was leaked in November and showed a track list of 11 songs. Wichita Recordings did not comment, but the band members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales. Bloc Party started a promotional tour of North America the same month with Panic! at the Disco, but cut it short after three concerts when Tong suffered a collapsed lung. The focus was changed to interviews throughout the world to explain the album's stylised lyrics and composition in the run-up to its release.Final tweaks on the album were completed in December 2006 in London. A high-quality version was leaked in January 2007 and its contents were confirmed by Okereke. Journalists who obtained an official copy of the album's final mix suggested that it featured electronically tampered rock soundscapes in the vein of Radiohead, New Order, and Björk. Bloc Party previewed A Weekend in the City in its entirety on 24 January 2007 at the Bournemouth Old Firestation, a performance which coincided with the Japanese release of the album. The first single, ""The Prayer"", was released on 29 January. The band performed at a special BBC Radio 1 showcase at Maida Vale Studios on 30 January as a precursor to a February promotional tour of the UK.The album was released in the rest of the world in the first week of February. The title comes as a tangent to the central theme of the album, ""the living noise of a metropolis"". The cover art is part of A Modern Project by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg, famous for her night cityscapes of London and for the cover art of The Streets' Original Pirate Material. The photograph is an aerial image of London's Westway, which shows the road and the adjacent sports pitches lit by the sodium glow of street lamps, and was chosen because the band believed ""it was important we captured London breathing"". Luxemburg has explained that ""in this picture you can see how intricately and optimistically public space in the city is shared"".",db64b5b86c7e6f7b9d137226dda2a06c,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,Bloc Party,bert,23ac42de9891fb5baecdc4f624fc0e3c,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,"Bloc Party started a promotional tour of North America the same month with Panic! at the Disco,",bert,6e16f23ba8f56ab6ced654b1784c549d,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,"Bloc Party started a promotional tour of North America the same month with Panic! at the Disco, but cut it short after three concerts when Tong",bert,5bb3d33c7b0a15961402a03a051824b9,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,"Panic! at the Disco,",bert,0d4987022bae7d2926900ccb61b3ca11,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,"Panic! at the Disco, but cut it short after three concerts when Tong",bert,f4755c97b93b384154547fca2a7018ef,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,Tong,bert,d6d325d431bb9e87145a37f619fd1287,Whose members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales?,Bloc Party,Bloc,bert,167dfba9f1e6d0d748d321acdd0d27c9,Whose members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales?,Bloc Party,Party,bert,3b900f3f6c937c42ad41a12d7cfaf08c,Whose members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales?,Bloc Party,Rut Blees,bert,8a94c4618460c832f561bcabe685dd9f,Whose members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales?,Bloc Party,"Rut Blees Luxemburg,",bert,4bc2497ff4a510a618f650cf1a7787c7,Whose members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales?,Bloc Party,Wichita Recordings,bert,1c611da91256295b8b4246f01fcf745f,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Boo-Boo Bear wakes up from winter hibernation, excited about the new Spring. Then Yogi Bear wakes up, his only interest finding some food to eat. Cindy Bear unsuccessfully tries to woo Yogi. After Ranger Smith thwarts Yogi's latest attempts to grab some food, Yogi gets angry and convinces the Ranger to transfer him out of Jellystone National Park. Smith prepares Yogi to be sent over to the San Diego Zoo along with an identification tag. Yogi first says goodbye to everything, but tricks another bear named Corn Pone into going to California instead of him and Boo-Boo and Cindy remain unaware of this, thinking Yogi has departed for good. Soon, Yogi is stealing food from all over the park under the alter ego ""The Brown Phantom"", but Smith believes it is another bear. He threatens whoever it is to be sent to the zoo. Cindy, wishing to be with Yogi at the zoo, angers Smith into mistakenly sending her away. However, she gets sent to the St. Louis Zoo instead, as the San Diego Zoo does not need any more bears. When she realizes her true destination, she gets very sad, crying since she knows she would be far from Yogi now. Late that night, Cindy falls out of the train and becomes lost. A traveling circus is looking for a great act to raise their ratings, when suddenly, their dog runs off and scares Cindy into walking on the telephone wires, the perfect opportunity for the circus.",68d875756d32884af2e1426c8da6c27c,What is the name of the character that Boo-Boo Bear and Cindy Bear think were shipped to California?,Yogi Bear,"""The Brown Phantom"",",bert,80b81da69c906729c960d3e3ed9ae3aa,What is the name of the character that Boo-Boo Bear and Cindy Bear think were shipped to California?,Yogi Bear,Corn Pone,bert,dcc29d491323e752d1091a61d76f6ff2,What is the name of the character that Boo-Boo Bear and Cindy Bear think were shipped to California?,Yogi Bear,"Corn Pone into going to California instead of him and Boo-Boo and Cindy remain unaware of this, thinking Yogi",bert,9cbde473c06853388f2520d0b2b6f495,What is the name of the character that Boo-Boo Bear and Cindy Bear think were shipped to California?,Yogi Bear,Yogi,bert,ab0703ce94bbbee961c525ad0da4b8bb,What is the name of the character that Boo-Boo Bear and Cindy Bear think were shipped to California?,Yogi Bear,"Yogi has departed for good.

When she realizes her true destination, she gets very sad, crying since she knows she would be far from Yogi now. Late that night, Cindy falls out of the train and becomes lost. A traveling circus is looking for a great act to raise their ratings, when suddenly, their dog runs off and scares Cindy into walking on the telephone wires, the perfect opportunity for the circus.",09d48f5df145a6ec51f00a01ad83603f,What is the name of the character who cries when they learn their true destination?,Cindy,Cindy Bear,bert,35889162ccd99c85b479cb1ecbb686e0,What is the name of the character who cries when they learn their true destination?,Cindy,Yogi Bear,bert,849691a58afe0212a9135339c026f594,What is the name of the character who cries when they learn their true destination?,Cindy,"Yogi Bear wakes up, his only interest finding some food to eat.

"Border Patrol agents Bobby Logan and Ernie Wyatt are planting motion sensors in a remote area of the Texas desert when they stumble across what appears to a decades-old Jeep buried in the sand. Upon excavating the vehicle, they find an intact skeleton in the driver's seat, a toolbox containing $800,000 in unused 10 & 20 dollar bills, and a hunting case containing a scoped sniper rifle with matching ammunition. The skeleton is accompanied by a wallet, containing the driver's license of a Michael J. Curtis from San Antonio, and a slip of paper with two phone numbers on it. Logan speculates that the money is from a bank heist in the early 1960s, and suggests he and Wyatt and take the money for themselves.

"By September 1963, Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. They usually called themselves Sigma 6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided occasional vocals. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic.When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963, the remaining members asked Barrett and guitarist Bob Klose to join. Waters switched to the bass and by January 1964, the group became known as the Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. Sometime during late 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and by early 1966, Pink Floyd.By early 1966, Barrett was Pink Floyd's frontman, guitarist, and songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, released in August 1967. Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk"" (his first sole writing credit) to the album. By late 1967, Barrett's deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour, rendered him ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd's singer-songwriter and lead guitarist. In early March 1968 Pink Floyd met with managers Peter Jenner and Andrew King of Blackhill Enterprises to discuss the band's future. Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band ""agreed to Blackhill's entitlement in perpetuity"" regarding ""past activities"". The band's new manager Steve O'Rourke made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of David Gilmour in April 1968.",dd3fd0fa400b711843052b7a2925445e,"What is the name of the Pink Floyd singer-songwriter and lead guitarist who was ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as either?",Barrett,Barrett's,bert,3675e684f9e804bec8cd5f0a3b3a385e,"What is the name of the Pink Floyd singer-songwriter and lead guitarist who was ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as either?",Barrett,Keith Noble,bert,7886510aef3873dd6112f06023df481e,"What is the name of the Pink Floyd singer-songwriter and lead guitarist who was ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as either?",Barrett,Waters,bert,01106f5671dacd40e8606740744774bd,"What is the name of the Pink Floyd singer-songwriter and lead guitarist who was ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as either?",Barrett,"Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble",bert,4dff7d29148ef4e78158cb232a9c34a2,"What is the name of the album to which Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""?",The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,"Dawn,",bert,bd83f6c7fe739d99d7c916ba20181654,"What is the name of the album to which Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""?",The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The,bert,d2a8c10e1b49a5720637a0621456a061,"What is the name of the album to which Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""?",The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The Piper,bert,6c48e43a82bdfe30af7d87167fc6f251,"What is the name of the album to which Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""?",The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The Piper at the Gates,bert,0642f3d1f3e2feeee1268c61e3523fb5,"What is the name of the person who wrote or co-wrote all but one track of the debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, released in August 1967?",Barrett,Barrett's,bert,163c0f5c578bab0d5e5d0763e87dd3fd,"What is the name of the person who wrote or co-wrote all but one track of the debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, released in August 1967?",Barrett,Waters,bert,4c2485e8547dae0ac52473d91ed33c22,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Captain Crewe (played by Ian Hunter), called to fight in the Second Boer War, has to leave his daughter Sara with her pony at Miss Minchin's School for Girls. With all the money Captain Crewe can offer, Miss Minchin gives Sara a fancy, private room. Although worried about her father, Sara is distracted by riding lessons. It is during these riding lessons that Sara helps contrive meetings between Miss Rose, her teacher, and Mr. Geoffrey, the riding instructor, who is also the grandson of the mean-spirited next door neighbor, Lord Wickham. Sara hears news that Mafeking is free and expects her father will soon come home. Miss Minchin throws Sara a lavish birthday party. During the party, Captain Crewe's solicitor arrives with the sad news that Captain Crewe has died and his real estate, the basis for his wealth, has been confiscated. Miss Minchin ends Sara's party abruptly. Without her father's financial support, Sara becomes a servant, now working at the school she used to attend.

"Caversham has no secondary schools, although it does contain two primary schools and a special needs school. Caversham Primary School, at the corner of South Road and Surrey Street, has been at its present site since 1921. The school dates back to the early 1860s, and has a current enrollment of around 80 pupils. The school's two-storey 1920s brick buildings were pulled down and replaced in 1961, because of their structural unsoundness. The school's main gate – the only surviving remnant of the earlier structure – is the suburb's war memorial.College Street School, south of South Road's retail area, was built on an earlier site of Caversham Primary School. It was officially part of Caversham Primary School until 1959, when it was declared a separate institution, and now has about 250 pupils. A third school, the Sara Cohen School in Rutherford Street, was established in 1926. This school caters for special needs pupils from primary school age through adulthood. The school was named for the late wife of Mark Cohen, city councillor, campaigner for women's rights, and editor of the Evening Star newspaper from 1893 to 1920.

"Charles Dickens quotes it in Chapter 43 of Martin Chuzzlewit: ...as the poet informs us, England expects Every man to do his duty, England is the most sanguine country on the face of the earth, and will find itself continually disappointed. In Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark, the Bellman says: For England Expects – I forbear to proceed. Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite. In Ogden Nash's collection of poems I'm a Stranger Here Myself (1938) there is a short poem ""England Expects"". During the Second World War, an Admiralty propaganda poster intended to increase industrial production on the home front, carried the slogan; ""Britain expects that you too, this day, will do your duty"". Nelson's flag signal was hoisted by the Royal Navy monitor, HMS Erebus at the start of the bombardment for the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944.It was also referenced by Margaret Thatcher during her crucial speech to the cabinet which finally persuaded them to rally behind her over the divisive issue of the poll tax. Further afield, it has been adapted by James Joyce in his novel, Ulysses, such as ""Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty"". Today ""England expects..."" is often adapted for use in the media, especially in relation to the expectations for the victory of English sporting teams. Such is the sentence's connotation with sport that a book on the history of the England national football team by James Corbett was entitled England Expects. A BBC Scotland television drama also bears its name.",f7a4972c807e5331421773f7a2727e74,What name does BBC Scotland television drama have?,"""England expects...""",England,bert,a8b174a099fd69c84ee9f818523e7263,What name does BBC Scotland television drama have?,"""England expects...""",England Expects.,bert,23e4c4cc5956a66488f0e233ca0d01be,What name does BBC Scotland television drama have?,"""England expects...""",England national football team by James Corbett was entitled England,bert,791e1105da683ac3c9087918f7e44602,What name does BBC Scotland television drama have?,"""England expects...""",England national football team by James Corbett was entitled England Expects.,bert,2be7cd4a11e783b8682d9b009b42d60e,What name does BBC Scotland television drama have?,"""England expects...""",Expects.,bert,68306fb58550cf2498766bd98d168cda,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (Italian: [ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi] (listen); 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, string player and choirmaster. A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history. Born in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c. 1590–1613) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di capella at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics. Much of Monteverdi's output, including many stage works, has been lost. His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals, large-scale sacred works such as his Vespro della Beata Vergine (Vespers) of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera L'Orfeo (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice, including Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea. While he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony, such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica, contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the prima pratica. Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century.

"Colin McNally is a troubled teenager being brought up by his widowed mother following his father's death. With his carefree attitude towards the political situation in Northern Ireland, Colin becomes involved in criminal activities. He and friends, Spuds and Jimbo begin to steal cars, take them for a joyride and later set fire to them. Following a car accident on one of their joyrides, Colin and his friends escape with only a few minor injuries and are arrested. While he and his friends are separately being questioned, a policeman makes Colin an offer - either he helps the police by becoming an informant in bringing down a top IRA man or he and his friends will be sent to prison. Although his father was a top IRA man before he died, Colin, knowing that he is making the wrong decision and that he would be going against his father and the others, takes the policeman up on his offer in order to stay out of prison which causes friction between him and his friends. Colin, Spuds, and Jimbo continue their criminal behavior and following numerous warnings from the police and the IRA, who has been lenient with Colin for who is father was, Spuds and Jimbo are kneecapped and Colin, having escaped this, is threatened and told to leave the country. Colin eventually has the top IRA man captured, and with his guilt he goes to the local priest for forgiveness. While there is nothing more the priest can do, the IRA men enter the church and take Colin to kill him. Colin asks one last thing of them for which it is granted. He writes a letter to his mother telling her that he is safe and well in England so that she will not worry about him.

"Composers whom Takemitsu cited as influential in his early work include Claude Debussy, Anton Webern, Edgard Varèse, Arnold Schoenberg, and Olivier Messiaen. (Messiaen was introduced to him by fellow composer Toshi Ichiyanagi, and remained a lifelong influence.) Although Takemitsu's wartime experiences of nationalism initially discouraged him from cultivating an interest in traditional Japanese music, he showed an early interest in ""... the Japanese Garden in color spacing and form ..."". The formal garden of the kaiyu-shiki interested him in particular.He expressed his unusual stance toward compositional theory early on, his lack of respect for the ""trite rules of music, rules that are ... stifled by formulas and calculations""; for Takemitsu it was of far greater importance that ""sounds have the freedom to breathe. ... Just as one cannot plan his life, neither can he plan music"".Takemitsu's sensitivity to instrumental and orchestral timbre can be heard throughout his work, and is often made apparent by the unusual instrumental combinations he specified. This is evident in works such as November Steps, that combine traditional Japanese instruments, shakuhachi and biwa, with a conventional Western orchestra. It may also be discerned in his works for ensembles that make no use of traditional instruments, for example Quotation of Dream (1991), Archipelago S., for 21 players (1993), and Arc I & II (1963–66/1976). In these works, the more conventional orchestral forces are divided into unconventional ""groups"". Even where these instrumental combinations were determined by the particular ensemble commissioning the work, ""Takemitsu's genius for instrumentation (and genius it was, in my view) ..."", in the words of Oliver Knussen, ""... creates the illusion that the instrumental restrictions are self-imposed"".",064f10108f7a31120a9d1b687bc3b8e5,What is the first name of the person who was introduced to Takemitsu by fellow composer Toshi Ichiyanagi?,Olivier,"Anton Webern, Edgard Varèse, Arnold Schoenberg, and Olivier",bert,57ddf7c03610fe0b9461bff835de4613,What is the first name of the person who was introduced to Takemitsu by fellow composer Toshi Ichiyanagi?,Olivier,"Arnold Schoenberg, and Olivier",bert,4709d301a5f2bc5e33485c77bbd5641e,What is the first name of the person who was introduced to Takemitsu by fellow composer Toshi Ichiyanagi?,Olivier,"Claude Debussy, Anton Webern, Edgard Varèse, Arnold Schoenberg, and Olivier",bert,b0274035d22e8d32af68ceaefd4227f6,What is the first name of the person who was introduced to Takemitsu by fellow composer Toshi Ichiyanagi?,Olivier,"Edgard Varèse, Arnold Schoenberg, and Olivier",bert,11a8e0c53bdc16fe45016f352a05c005,What is the first name of the person who was introduced to Takemitsu by fellow composer Toshi Ichiyanagi?,Olivier,Olivier Messiaen.,bert,8626638ce5f2232d3b904a3487be32d2,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Darren Silverman, Wayne LeFessier, and J.D. McNugent, best friends since fifth grade and Neil Diamond fans throughout, form a Neil Diamond tribute band called ""Diamonds in the Rough"". Darren meets a beautiful but domineering psychologist who is showing signs of being emotionally abusive, Judith Fessbeggler, through a chance encounter in a local bar after a band gig. Six weeks into their relationship, Darren asks Judith if whether they could finally have sex, but Judith refuses in the belief that premarital sex is wrong; rather, she suggests non-penetrative sex as alternative, during which Darren gets nothing but a sore jaw. Judith isolates Darren from his friends, demands that Darren quit the band, receive humiliating medical procedures, and attend relationship counseling under her care. Wayne and J.D. decide to save Darren from her by attempting to bribe her, arm wrestle her, and shock her with faked photographs of Darren cheating, all to no avail. The friends, undaunted, try to reunite Darren with his ""one and only"", Sandy Perkus, when she returns to Seattle to take her final vows as a nun. When Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith. However, Judith eventually discovers the identity of her captors, and the duo are convinced they cannot let her go. When they visit Coach Norton in jail (who accidentally killed a referee in a fit of rage) his advice is that they should just kill her. The pair attempt to shoot Judith, but end up deciding against it. Sandy's feelings for Darren are reawakened, but the pair's attempted date is ruined by Darren's preoccupation with Judith. Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent, but Darren snaps out of it and runs the 30 miles there to win her back.",4883c83ef9c121e9d487c7bb7237ce5d,What are the first names of the people who visit someone in jail?,Wayne and J.D,Darren,bert,b85d8721bf72b62711ca9b26bfd137c9,What are the first names of the people who visit someone in jail?,Wayne and J.D,"Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne",bert,30c7c9f6dcf0b0ab9f826f7516d685bd,What are the first names of the people who visit someone in jail?,Wayne and J.D,"Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith.

"Despite a political climate that was unfavorable to modern art (often denounced as ""formalist"" by the communist authorities), post-war Polish composers enjoyed an unprecedented degree of compositional freedom following the establishment of the Warsaw Autumn festival in 1956. Górecki had won recognition among avant-garde composers for the experimental, dissonant and serialist works of his early career; he became visible on the international scene through such modernist works as Scontri, which was a success at the 1960 Warsaw Autumn, and his First Symphony, which was awarded a prize at the 1961 Paris Youth Bienniale. Throughout the 1960s, he continued to form acquaintanceships with other experimental and serialist composers such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. During the 1970s, Górecki began to distance himself from the serialism and extreme dissonance of his earlier work, and his Third Symphony, like the preceding choral pieces Euntes ibant et flebant (Op. 32, 1972) and Amen (Op. 35, 1975), starkly rejects such techniques. The lack of harmonic variation in Górecki's Third Symphony, and its reliance on repetition, marked a stage in Górecki's progression towards the harmonic minimalism and the simplified textures of his more recent work. Because of the religious nature of many of his works during this period, critics and musicologists often align him with other modernist composers who began to explore radically simplified musical textures, tonality, and melody, and who also infused many of their works with religious significance. Like-minded composers, such as Arvo Pärt and John Tavener, are frequently grouped with Górecki under the term ""holy minimalism,"" although none of the composers classified as such has admitted to common influences.",c9c1cdab9d003d6962794e404596c91e,What is the last name of the person who continued to form acquaintanceships with other experimental and serialist composers ?,Górecki,Górecki's,bert,e716bcb9c8fd8a41ea6d73fb62f00f4d,What is the last name of the person who continued to form acquaintanceships with other experimental and serialist composers ?,Górecki,"Górecki's Third Symphony, and its reliance on repetition, marked a stage in Górecki's",bert,a7693028b572a58ac6c62367cec527d4,What is the last name of the person who continued to form acquaintanceships with other experimental and serialist composers?,Górecki,Górecki's,bert,40d5f5fd8a6518238612181afd71ff90,What is the last name of the person who continued to form acquaintanceships with other experimental and serialist composers?,Górecki,"Górecki's Third Symphony, and its reliance on repetition, marked a stage in Górecki's",bert,be98e5ccd3ea42e92d87e7b75329c10b,Whose works were religious in nature?,Górecki,Górecki's,bert,575d061d8489b2b40c84ef49cd4a3728,Whose works were religious in nature?,Górecki,"Górecki's Third Symphony, and its reliance on repetition, marked a stage in Górecki's",bert,98a6206e80381bfbb89e11f3255b2b60,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Director Reed Cowan, who is a former Mormon missionary, ""planned on making a film about gay teen homelessness and suicide in Utah, but switched his focus to Mormon ideology because of how it contributes to the homophobia that causes these problems"". The film focuses on the wealth and power of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and how the Church uses the National Organization for Marriage to advocate for denial of rights to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans. It states that LDS Church leader Thomas S. Monson asked to ensure the passage of the controversial California Proposition 8. It also claims that many homeless people in Utah are LGBT teens who were abandoned by their Mormon parents.

"Dr. John Rollason, his wife, Helen, and assistant, Peter Fox, are guests of the Lama of the monastery of Rong-buk while on a botanical expedition to the Himalayas. A second expedition, led by Dr. Tom Friend accompanied by trapper Ed Shelley, photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide Kusang, arrives at the monastery in search of the legendary Yeti or Abominable Snowman. Rollason, despite the objections of his wife and the Lama, decides to join Friend's expedition. Whereas Rollason is motivated by scientific curiosity to learn more about the creature, Friend seeks fame and fortune and wants to capture a live Yeti and present it to the world's press. The expedition climbs high into the mountains and finds a set of giant footprints in the snow, evidence of the Yeti's existence. As the tensions between Rollason and Friend rise, McNee is injured by a bear trap laid by Friend to catch the Yeti and later dies in a fall. Kusang flees back to the monastery from where Helen and Fox decide to mount a rescue mission. Meanwhile, Shelley succeeds in shooting and killing a Yeti, an act that enrages the creature's fellows. When Shelley is killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen, Friend finally decides to cut his losses and leave with the body of the dead Yeti. However, the Yeti close in on the two survivors and Friend is killed in an avalanche. Rollason takes refuge in an ice cave and watches in amazement as a number of Yeti arrive and take away the body of their fallen compatriot. He realises the Yeti are an intelligent species biding their time to claim the Earth when humanity has destroyed itself. The rescue party finds Rollason and brings him back to the monastery where, when questioned by the Lama, he claims the expedition found nothing (apparently the result of telepathic hypnosis by the Yetis).",e4d9b14cdfb2a58b5050458d9b176327,How does the trapper die?,killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen,a bear trap laid by Friend to catch the Yeti and later dies in a fall.,bert,d0e6fd9352ef3b8845cfad72fb68d9d5,How does the trapper die?,killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen,a fall,bert,1e5bdd67b93bfdf4c2b0e0b0a5fa6587,How does the trapper die?,killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen,in a fall,bert,9317512ab2c1f98674d477070b08f75d,How does the trapper die?,killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen,in an avalanche,bert,1ece83e7a0cff4e585b6d2c3c5e8f013,How does the trapper die?,killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen,injured by a bear trap,bert,3e596cd39a8446ee038ea50ac2cf01e4,How does the trapper die?,killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen,injured by a bear trap laid by Friend to catch the Yeti and later dies in a fall.,bert,0cf0707f30a14524831d9fde31e8ce8e,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,photographer,bert,c6642c9ebcea1e8637ef2a75977a3a05,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide,bert,be3cd1720abe5891e88f3b37e4c6daa9,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,"photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide Kusang, arrives at the monastery in search of the legendary Yeti or Abominable Snowman.",bert,954600966a0e08520caa3d8a5f4f728c,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,trapper,bert,51a08a033fe1019aeffd0ffba5dbbccc,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,"trapper Ed Shelley, photographer",bert,3ca0de8c291d39b2d82865f3c00a3cf4,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,"trapper Ed Shelley, photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide",bert,d55a1ffd140162e5f95dfff7bff7645b,What happens to the photographer on the expedition in the mountains?,injured by a bear trap,Abominable Snowman.,bert,e99f560b0dd8fd035be57c1f5e3390f5,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Dr. Watson is serving as resident doctor at Musgrave Manor in Northumberland, a stately home which is also used as a hospital for a number of servicemen suffering from shell shock.When Sally Musgrave displays her feelings for one of the wounded American fighter pilots, Captain Pat Vickery, who is currently recovering at the family estate, her brothers Geoffrey and Phillip are quick to show their dismay. Then one of the physicians working at the estate, Dr. Sexton, is assaulted by an unknown assailant when out on a walk. Dr. John Watson, who is in charge of the medical facility, goes to fetch his dear friend Sherlock Holmes to bring some clarity to the case of the attack. Upon his arrival to the estate, Sherlock Holmes discovers the dead body of one of the brothers, Geoffrey.

Holmes is of another opinion about the flyer's guilt and continues to investigate on his own.  Phillip is formally made the new head of the estate the next day with the aid of his sister.  But after only one day of ruling the estate, Phillip too is found murdered, lying in the trunk of the car. Lestrade suspects the family butler, Alfred Brunton, to be the murderer because Phillip had just fired the butler. Trying to arrest the butler, Lestrade gets lost in the manor's secret passageways. Meanwhile Holmes and Watson look into the special ""Musgrave Ritual"" that the family uses to appoint the new head of the family.

"Duncan McLeod, a gentleman artist and former Naval officer, assisted by his crewman Lefty Brown, engages in smuggling contraband liquor between France and Britain across the English Channel. Duncan and Lefty store the liquor at the Quiet Woman, a local pub in their coastal town, only to find one day that its complicit owner has moved away without telling them, and the pub is now being run by Jane Foster and her maid Elsie. Jane makes clear that she does not approve of activities that break the law, and demands that Duncan and Lefty remove their cache of contraband liquor from her property immediately or she will contact customs officials.

"Early industries in the area included C & W Sheil's brickworks, which had quarries in Forbury, St Clair and Caversham, and Caversham Gasworks, which operated from 1882 until 1909. The last buildings of the gasworks were a local landmark, and were not removed until the construction of the Caversham bypass in the 1970s and 1980s. Other noted industries in early Caversham included breweries, a tannery, and a match factory.Construction of the South Island Main Trunk railway south of Dunedin that began in 1871 led to the construction of a 865-metre (2,838 ft) tunnel beneath Lookout Point, connecting Caversham with Green Island. A second parallel 1,407-metre (4,616 ft) tunnel – the first double-track tunnel in the country – was built starting in 1907, and all rail traffic moved to the new tunnel in 1910. Caversham was served by its own railway station until its closure in 1962. There has been a long-running campaign to have the older tunnel converted into a cycleway, though this scheme has never gained wholehearted council support.By the 1870s the population of Caversham was growing rapidly, and in 1877, with the population at around 4,000, it was declared a borough. It held this status until amalgamation with Dunedin city in 1904. The borough's area included much of modern Forbury and St Clair, as well as what is usually regarded as Caversham today.",0ce51aecdb2df313f19e0648de533f11,What did the older tunnel that there's a been a campaign to convert into a cycleway run under?,Lookout Point,Caversham was served by its own railway station,bert,83a85e104708f929c9beff2ed0313666,What did the older tunnel that there's a been a campaign to convert into a cycleway run under?,Lookout Point,"Lookout Point, connecting Caversham with Green Island.",bert,139d4d9dd5360c46f945bc8ef26208a5,What did the older tunnel that there's a been a campaign to convert into a cycleway run under?,Lookout Point,"Lookout Point, connecting Caversham with Green Island.

"Egypt first requested the return of the Rosetta Stone in July 2003, on the British Museum's 250th anniversary. Zahi Hawass, the chief of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, asked that the stele be repatriated to Egypt, commenting that it was the ""icon of our Egyptian identity"". He repeated the proposal two years later in Paris, listing the stone as one of several key items belonging to Egypt's cultural heritage, a list which also included: the iconic bust of Nefertiti in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin; a statue of the Great Pyramid architect Hemiunu in the Roemer-und-Pelizaeus-Museum in Hildesheim, Germany; the Dendara Temple Zodiac in the Louvre in Paris; and the bust of Ankhhaf from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.During 2005, the British Museum presented Egypt with a full-sized replica of the stele. This was initially displayed in the renovated Rashid National Museum, close to the site where the stone was found. In November 2005, Hawass suggested a three-month loan of the Rosetta Stone, while reiterating the eventual goal of a permanent return. In December 2009, he proposed to drop his claim for the permanent return of the Rosetta Stone if the British Museum lent the stone to Egypt for three months for the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza in 2013. These requests were refused. As John Ray has observed, ""the day may come when the stone has spent longer in the British Museum than it ever did in Rosetta."" There is strong opposition among national museums to the repatriation of objects of international cultural significance such as the Rosetta Stone. In response to repeated Greek requests for return of the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon and similar requests to other museums around the world, in 2002 over 30 of the world's leading museums — including the British Museum, the Louvre, the Pergamon Museum in Berlin and the Metropolitan Museum in New York City — issued a joint statement declaring that ""objects acquired in earlier times must be viewed in the light of different sensitivities and values reflective of that earlier era"" and that ""museums serve not just the citizens of one nation but the people of every nation"".",9966ddec35c9ad4a6c66a54a1f4628a0,What replica was displayed in 2005 at the Rashid National Museum?,Rosetta Stone,stele,bert,6785baf9588a64e075eec7663d9a8562,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Elliot Guilespie is a smalltown twentysomething with aspirations of stardom in television news as his alter-ego, Lance Windchaser.  He idolises the local TV news anchor, Rod Reel, who is intermittently shown reporting on the spree of a local serial killer known as the Rubik's Cube Killer, or ""RCK"". Elliot's home life is less than ideal; he still lives with his mother and never knew his father, who was killed in a ""freak hospital accident"". Compounding Elliot's frustrating life is Roy-Henry Ringold, who terrorized Elliot in high school, but is now a recovering alcoholic and desperately seeks his forgiveness. Roy-Henry's quest for forgiveness is conflicted with the fact that he is sleeping with Elliot's mother and feels compelled to act as a father figure to the aimless Elliot. As if that weren't enough, Elliot works for Roy-Henry's landscaping company. Elliot does not own a car and is unwilling to ingratiate himself to Roy-Henry for transportation, so his main mode of transportation comes from Toby's Taxi Service, driven by Toby, a depressed family man who vents to an unwilling Elliot about the horrors of his hen-pecked homelife. After a disastrous attempt at handling the filming and the reporting simultaneously, Elliot enlists Toby as his cameraman. Desperate for friendship and an opportunity to escape his horrible marriage, Toby happily agrees and the two begin a whirlwind escapade of freelance journalism marked largely by failure, ridicule, and numerous injuries.",885e1d2abf1fefcc859d78e550708cb9,What is the full name of the person who the local TV news anchor?,Elliot Guilespie,"Elliot Guilespie is a smalltown twentysomething with aspirations of stardom in television news as his alter-ego, Lance Windchaser.",bert,53ab6cbfb33d4a088a311545010c04d1,What is the full name of the person who the local TV news anchor?,Elliot Guilespie,Lance Windchaser.,bert,ee1738cdb9b658d2e0260cbb54cf4741,What is the full name of the person who the local TV news anchor?,Elliot Guilespie,"Lance Windchaser.

"Ernest Baker and Lauren Nostro of Complex ranked ""Diamonds"" atop their list of The 10 Best Guilty Pleasure Songs of 2012 and wrote that, although the song is unlike Rihanna's louder, more anthemic songs, ""apparently the world loves to see a softer side of her, too."" Black Entertainment Television placed the single at number six on their 50 Best Songs of 2012 list and called it one of Rihanna's most emotive performances. UK E! Online's reviewer named it the fifth best song of the year and said that Rihanna's vocal performance on the song validates the attention she had received since her breakthrough with ""Umbrella"". Irish Independent's Jim Hayes ranked it as the year's tenth-best song and described it as ""a laid back slow burner that invades and refuses to leave"".

"Eshmun was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the Phoenician pantheon and the main male divinity of Sidon. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to Babylonian deity Tammuz. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes.The myth of Eshmun was related by the sixth century Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius.

"Eshmun was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the Phoenician pantheon and the main male divinity of Sidon. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to Babylonian deity Tammuz. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes.The myth of Eshmun was related by the sixth century Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius.

"Eve Gill is an aspiring actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. She is interrupted in rehearsal by her friend (and crush), actor Jonathan Cooper, the secret lover of flamboyant stage actress/singer Charlotte Inwood. Via a flashback, he says Charlotte visited him after killing her husband; she was wearing a bloodstained dress. Jonathan claims he went back to her house for another dress, but was seen by Nellie Goode, Charlotte's cockney maid/dresser. He escaped the police and needs help. Eve takes him to her father's house on the coast to hide. Commodore Gill notices that the blood on Charlotte's dress has been smeared on deliberately; he and Eve think that Jonathan was framed by Charlotte. Jonathan angrily destroys the dress and thus the most useful piece of evidence. Eve starts to investigate. She hears Charlotte's dresser Nellie Goode boasting about her new found notoriety in a bar. While she is there, Eve meets Detective Inspector Wilfred O. Smith, and they become friendly. Eve then poses as a reporter; she bribes Nellie to tell Charlotte she is ill and to introduce her cousin ""Doris Tinsdale"" as a replacement. Using her acting skills, Eve becomes ""Doris"" and starts working for Charlotte. Eve discovers Charlotte is having an affair with her manager Freddie Williams.

"Ex special forces mercenary and now hardened criminal Vic, (Michael Lazar) lives in a world of cons, double crosses, crooked cops, mob bosses and drug dealing crime lords. Playing by his own rules, Vic and his partner Frank work both sides of the street, caring only about where they can score and take down the most cash. After a dangerous shootout during a drug deal gone bad, Vic finds himself working for ruthless crime boss Paul Santo. Santo's being indicted for murder, and he enlists Vic and Frank to kill the three witnesses that will testify against him. Watching Vic's every move is Santo's strongest soldier, Ray, (Michael Madsen) a stone cold killer, who would like nothing better than to whack Vic and Frank the moment his boss gives him the okay. As the Asian proverb says, ""In the shadow of every crime is a woman"" and that holds true for Vic as his grifter girlfriend Thea and Frank's ex, the exotic, sultry, Layla have their own agendas as they both try in their own way to use and manipulate their men. As Vic tries to juggle all this as well as kill the witnesses to pay off his debt to Santo, and at the same time avoid Ray's wrath, he is pursued by crooked vice cop Ford who's relentless as he turns up the heat on Vic and Frank. On top of all this, it doesn't help that Asian crime lord, Cho and his henchman Butch are applying their own brand of pressure on Vic and Frank. They want to take out Santo and Ray, using Vic and Frank as pawns in their game of revenge and murder.

"Farmer Al Falfa arrives in New York City by taxi. Yards away, a man with binoculars on a rooftop looks for visitors to rob until setting sights on Al. The man phone calls a femme fatale woman and tells her to meet him. The woman finds and invites Al to come with her to a night club. At the night club, Al and the woman drink some wine. After consuming two glasses, he becomes intoxicated and collapses. While Al is flat on the floor, the woman heads to his bag, and takes some valuables before running off. Coming out of the bag is Al's dog which barks to wake up its master. Just after exiting the night club, Al, who still has hangover, decides to lay his back on a lightpost. Momentarily, a hefty man comes and greets him. Figuring he has lots of cash, the hefty man invites and takes Al to the latter's buddies. Al meets the hefty man's three friends at a poker room who then entice him to a high-stakes poker game. Over the course of the play, Al's stacks of chips become smaller and smaller. One of the poker players then employ an illegal strategy of secretly trying to pass cards to another player. Al, who is suspicious of the game, opens his bag and releases his dog which snatches and brings the cards to him. Al then comes up with a winning combination that garners him all the chips on the table, much to the other players' surprise. The dog then puts out the light, and a brawl erupts. Fortunately for him, Al is able to escape with his winnings.

"Farthest South was the most southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911. Significant steps on the road to the pole were the discovery of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing of the Antarctic Circle in 1773, and the earliest confirmed sightings of the Antarctic mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911. In the years before reaching the pole was a realistic objective, other motives drew adventurers southward. Initially, the driving force was the discovery of new trade routes between Europe and the Far East. After such routes had been established and the main geographical features of the earth had been broadly mapped, the lure for mercantile adventurers was the great fertile continent of ""Terra Australis"" which, according to myth, lay hidden in the south. Belief in the existence of this supposed land of plenty persisted well into the 18th century; explorers were reluctant to accept the truth that slowly emerged, of a cold, harsh environment in the lands of the Southern Ocean. James Cook's voyages of 1771–74 demonstrated conclusively the likely hostile nature of any hidden lands. This caused a shift of emphasis in the first half of the 19th century, away from trade and towards sealing and whaling, and then exploration and discovery. After the first overwintering on continental Antarctica in 1898–99 (Adrien de Gerlache), the prospect of reaching the South Pole appeared realistic, and the race for the pole began. The British were pre-eminent in this endeavor, which was characterized by the rivalry between Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Shackleton's efforts fell short; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen.",380d495e321fe6441ff921d39e71b797,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Ernest,bert,a3ae23d3d8ecf2b2b156adb1e3d9a7ce,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Robert Falcon,bert,9e34e6cc1bc7965532a02a6e590c3716,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Robert Falcon Scott,bert,9f092c8dca074b01dbd99b55a07bdee2,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest,bert,513fc0e0731302fc61bc15f4c33673bf,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton,bert,28ed52e77161b729d5ed7e6e5b79566a,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert,bert,600907bf60cd621b4b8c696103ab05d9,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert Falcon,bert,f897b8246337013bbaee4faa78b900c4,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert Falcon Scott,bert,821eac39f6c3fcec88d4cb3b794208d1,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest,bert,bea11cb1f4eae6160b9524b02c75ee85,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton,bert,438cd42f6bdbc957bcf1c345ca78d8da,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Fauré is regarded as one of the masters of the French art song, or mélodie. Ravel wrote in 1922 that Fauré had saved French music from the dominance of the German Lied. Two years later the critic Samuel Langford wrote of Fauré, ""More surely almost than any writer in the world he commanded the faculty to create a song all of a piece, and with a sustained intensity of mood which made it like a single thought"". In a 2011 article the pianist and writer Roy Howat and the musicologist Emily Kilpatrick wrote: His devotion to the mélodie spans his career, from the ever-fresh ""Le papillon et la fleur"" of 1861 to the masterly cycle L'horizon chimérique, composed sixty years and more than a hundred songs later. Fauré's songs are now core repertoire for students and professionals, sung in conservatories and recital halls throughout the world. In Copland's view, the early songs, written in the 1860s and 1870s under the influence of Gounod, except for isolated songs such as ""Après un rêve"" or ""Au bord de l'eau"", show little sign of the artist to come. With the second volume of the sixty collected songs written during the next two decades, Copland judged, came the first mature examples of ""the real Fauré"". He instanced ""Les berceaux"", ""Les roses d'Ispahan"" and especially ""Clair de lune"" as ""so beautiful, so perfect, that they have even penetrated to America"", and drew attention to less well known mélodies such as ""Le secret"", ""Nocturne"", and ""Les présents"". Fauré also composed a number of song cycles. Cinq mélodies ""de Venise"", Op. 58 (1891), was described by Fauré as a novel kind of song suite, in its use of musical themes recurring over the cycle. For the later cycle La bonne chanson, Op. 61 (1894), there were five such themes, according to Fauré.

"Film publicist Lee Phillips is tasked with promoting a film featuring a husband-wife acting team, Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas. His job is complicated by the fact that the eccentric director of the film, Hal Weidmann, refuses to show anyone a cut of the film, demanding the first viewing take place at a press junket. To promote the film and to save his job, Lee decides to focus on the two stars: Gwen and Eddie, once known as ""America's Sweethearts"". Unfortunately, they are now going through an ugly split. Gwen had an adulterous affair with her co-star Hector Gorgonzolas, who she now lives with, driving Eddie to an emotional breakdown. His actions after their split led Gwen to take out a restraining order against Eddie, and he is now living at a New Age retreat. Lee decides that his best chance to promote the film is to convince the press that the couple has reunited. Lee enlists the help of Gwen's sister and personal assistant, Kiki, to convince Gwen to come to the junket. Gwen's career and public image have been severely tarnished by her broken marriage, and the pair play on Gwen's ego by telling her she will look better to the press and her fans if she attends (and she will be able to serve Eddie with divorce papers in a neutral setting). Lee then bribes Eddie's spiritual guide to convince Eddie he is well enough to leave the retreat.",243de75d1286e5353cc289de96db0142,What is the first name of the person who lives with their co-star?,Gwen,"Eddie, once known as ""America's Sweethearts"".

"Five years after the Viking villagers of Berk and the dragons made peace, they live together in harmony. Hiccup and his dragon, Toothless the Night Fury the last of his kind, discover and map unexplored lands. Now 20 years old, he is being pressed by his father, Stoick the Vast, to succeed him as chieftain, although Hiccup feels unsure he is ready. While investigating a burnt forest, Hiccup and Astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a dangerous group of dragon-trappers. One of the trappers, Eret, blames the two for his fort's destruction and attempts to capture their dragons for the trappers' leader, Drago Bludvist, who plots to capture and brainwash all of the dragons and make them his pets and army. Hiccup and Astrid escape and warn Stoick about the dragon army Drago is amassing. Stoick orders the villagers to fortify the island and prepare for battle. Hiccup, however, refuses to believe war is inevitable, and flies off to talk to Drago. Stoick stops him, explaining that he once met Drago at a gathering of chiefs, where Drago had offered to protect them from dragons if they pledged to serve him; when they refused, he had his dragons attack them, with Stoick the sole survivor.

"Foghorn Leghorn is filing his nails when Widow Hen comes by and asks a curmudgeonly old rooster Mr. Cackle to watch her young son, Junior, while she goes out. Mr. Cackle refuses, claiming Junior is destructive, disrespectful and incorrigible (""ME babysit with HIM?! You must be joshing!""); in fact, Mr. Cackle calls Junior ""that Monster of Yourn"" and says Junior ""makes Dennis the Menace look like an angel."" Mr. Cackle also points out that Junior is ""Bad, Bad, BAD!"". Foghorn overhears the proceedings and - hoping to silence Mr. Cackle from accusing Junior of things, and prove a point that "" there ain't no such thing as a bad boy"" - volunteers to watch Junior, who snickers : ""Oooh, he don't know me vewy well, do he?"". Just as Widow Hen goes, Foghorn promises that he and Junior will be friends, but Junior deliberately pokes Foghorn's bottom with a needle. Foghorn attempts to strangle Junior, but Mr. Cackle laughs at Foghorn's expense. Foghorn defends Junior by saying he was merely being ""playful."" Foghorn first takes Junior to a box full of toys to play with while he takes a nap, but Junior scoffs and, after declaring them ""widdle kids' stuff,"" decides to cause trouble. First, upon finding a cement mixer in the barn, Junior decides to call a false alarm, which leads to Foghorn landing in the cement mixer; he comes out posed as Rodin's ""The Thinker"" statue (Junior: ""I'm not weawwy a scuwptor. It's just me mean widdle hobby!""). Foghorn recovers and threatens to report Junior's misbehavior to Widow Hen, but Junior counters by warning that he'll tell his mother that Foghorn is still ""booking the horses"". Foghorn tries to laugh this off, and does - but Junior says ""And they're off!"", causing Foghorn to briefly mimick watching a horse race, only to realize in shock that he's been tricked again.",aab353748224250e2116fb05065a59f0,What is the full name of the animal that thinks they can prove the curmudgeonly old rooster wrong?,Foghorn Leghorn,Leghorn,bert,2f58859bad65f3ca0244d48cbb11b8d4,What is the full name of the animal that thinks they can prove the curmudgeonly old rooster wrong?,Foghorn Leghorn,Widow Hen,bert,da13479f3c195791c4dc92f836e1f2e6,Who does Foghorn threaten to tell about the child's bad behavior?,Widow Hen,Junior,bert,1576a9704f7cb16c13bf7a6c57b35b98,Who does Foghorn threaten to tell about the child's bad behavior?,Widow Hen,Junior counters by warning that he'll tell his mother,bert,e9e881c36e920db8f256c766e5b15908,Who does Foghorn threaten to tell about the child's bad behavior?,Widow Hen,"Widow Hen, but Junior",bert,da691082679dd7b7f6bb8539b21f7758,Who is the incorrigible child the son of?,Widow Hen,Foghorn Leghorn,bert,b519e47534bfe30e62a1f543c1dc3ce2,Who is the incorrigible child the son of?,Widow Hen,Foghorn Leghorn is filing his nails when Widow Hen,bert,ac73017116148802523fbe70ef813916,Who is the incorrigible child the son of?,Widow Hen,"Junior,",bert,18183f52e51aa6648ccf0c7ed1bc8351,Who is the incorrigible child the son of?,Widow Hen,"Junior, while she goes out.

"Following Operation Tungsten, British intelligence assessed that Tirpitz would be repaired within six months. Accordingly, Cunningham directed Fraser on 13 April to launch another attack on the battleship. While Cunningham did not believe that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, he hoped that further air strikes would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. Fraser initially resisted Cunningham's order, arguing that the prospects for a successful raid were poor as the Germans would have reinforced the defences around Tirpitz and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. He eventually relented, and Moore sailed from Scapa Flow on 21 April to attack Kaafjord again. This raid, designated Operation Planet, was called off on 24 April due to bad weather over the target area. Two other attacks, Operation Brawn and Operation Tiger Claw, also had to be cancelled on 15 and 28 May respectively because of adverse weather. Further carrier raids were attempted in July and August after Allied intelligence determined that the repairs to Tirpitz were nearing completion. During Operation Mascot a force of 42 Barracudas and 40 fighters attacked Tirpitz on 17 July, but did not score any hits as the battleship was hidden by a smokescreen. A further four carrier raids were conducted against Kaafjord between 22 and 29 August during Operation Goodwood, but these caused only light damage to the battleship.In late August it was decided that further Fleet Air Arm attacks should not be attempted as the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. As it was still seen as desirable to destroy Tirpitz, the task was assigned to Bomber Command. On 15 September a force of heavy bombers attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this, Tirpitz sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø to be used as an immobile coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, and a third raid was mounted on 12 November in which Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.",659c5488bb3e5ddae68f20863486ef0c,What crew's morale did Cunningham hope to harm with the attacks?,Tirpitz,Barracudas,bert,f143f6dc692870b9d42e4854d2f7eeea,What crew's morale did Cunningham hope to harm with the attacks?,Tirpitz,"Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz,",bert,8e70604033035fba2a6bb8877c718526,What crew's morale did Cunningham hope to harm with the attacks?,Tirpitz,"Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, he hoped that further air strikes would increase the period the battleship",bert,5615d95c3a2f63d81816807fbfe69e55,What crew's morale did Cunningham hope to harm with the attacks?,Tirpitz,"Tirpitz would be repaired within six months.

"Following the release of The Final Cut, Waters embarked on a solo career. In 1984, he released his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a project about a man's dreams across one night that dealt with Waters' feelings about monogamy and family life versus ""the call of the wild"". In the end the character, Reg, chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album featured guitarist Eric Clapton, jazz saxophonist David Sanborn, and artwork by Gerald Scarfe. Kurt Loder described The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking as a ""strangely static, faintly hideous record"". Rolling Stone rated the album a ""rock bottom one star"". Years later, Mike DeGagne of AllMusic praised the album for its ""ingenious symbolism"" and ""brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm"", rating it four out of five stars.Waters began touring in support of the album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a selection of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. The tour suffered from poor ticket sales and some performances at larger venues were cancelled; Waters estimated that he lost £400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff—North America Tour 1985. The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA.In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated movie When the Wind Blows, based on the Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band. In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S., a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who has the ability to physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state of the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack.

"For combination of grace, dramatic strength, and clearness in technique this picture would be difficult to surpass. There is nothing finicky about it; it tells its story with vivid directness. As a background to the figure Mrs. Rix Nicholas has set a piece of antique tapestry, so that the trees on either side lean in arch-wise over the head, the face and shoulders stand out clearly against an expanse of sky, and behind the body and limbs extends a countryside full of towers and rivers and trees. The quaint conventionality of this background accords exactly with the late eighteenth-century costume, all sprigged with roses and heliotrope; and the whole mass of detail harmonies [sic] perfectly with the type of the model's face. It is a cold, selfish face. The artist has brought out with revealing strokes an expression of vindictive malice which is for the moment resting there; and the hands, the fingers of one grasped tightly by the other, give a clear indication of nervous tension within. The treatment of flesh tones and the general arrangement, drawing attention gently but not too obtrusively to the columbines scattered on the polished floor—those are excellent. While she exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France, she was also creating many new works, including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume, produced during a summer in Brittany. In 1926, Rix Nicholas was again included in London's Royal Academy of Art exhibition, where one of her Brittany paintings, Le Bigouden, was hung. She also appeared at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, in which she had eight works, a very large number for a single artist. The Société not only hung many of her paintings and drawings: she was also elected an Associate to the organisation in that year.At the end of 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond together returned to Australia. Energised by her success, Rix Nicholas purchased a car, filled its rear compartment with painting equipment, and the pair set out to paint the landscape, ranging from Canberra and the Monaro plains to the south, up into central Queensland. This included a publicity-attracting occasion where she painted figures on the beach at Bondi, reported by various publications including Australian magazine, The Home.",c4133f84b891fcdc9f39731d8f308831,What is the full name of the organization to which Rix Nicholas was also elected an Associate?,Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts,Academy of Art,bert,d45ae91fb064933bb10ad86d98b00f0a,What is the full name of the organization to which Rix Nicholas was also elected an Associate?,Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts,Royal Academy,bert,cbb575a025d09755f4378d55a28d6d1d,What is the full name of the organization to which Rix Nicholas was also elected an Associate?,Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts,Royal Academy of Art,bert,940de875f5164ab9e9dc560cfa9e70f3,What is the full name of the organization to which Rix Nicholas was also elected an Associate?,Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts,"Royal Academy of Art exhibition,",bert,5e9464193b87f8e4754aebca809f502a,What is the full name of the organization to which Rix Nicholas was also elected an Associate?,Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts,Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition,bert,d4482388237894e30d75f41ebaa0f461,What is the full name of the person who paired with Rix Nicholas to set out and paint the landscape?,Dorothy Richmond,Dorothy,bert,7e6394fa7014ece15c3bf29df85c38c8,What is the full name of the person who paired with Rix Nicholas to set out and paint the landscape?,Dorothy Richmond,Mrs. Rix Nicholas,bert,08d38c218fc25cc6dbfa48919cde9e67,What is the full name of the person who paired with Rix Nicholas to set out and paint the landscape?,Dorothy Richmond,Richmond,bert,aa8b01217548ed91c08267747dc7fa18,What is the full name of the person who paired with Rix Nicholas to set out and paint the landscape?,Dorothy Richmond,Rix Nicholas and Dorothy,bert,1265e01e87d0cc07b3fd018d7398773d,What is the full name of the person who paired with Rix Nicholas to set out and paint the landscape?,Dorothy Richmond,Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond,bert,52a25b0c5b6aacfc81912542cd639321,What is the last name of the individual who exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France?,Nicholas,Mrs. Rix Nicholas,bert,e2e3a8db4b1a709b0cedef4e80d90679,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

While she exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France, she was also creating many new works, including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume, produced during a summer in Brittany. In 1926, Rix Nicholas was again included in London's Royal Academy of Art exhibition, where one of her Brittany paintings, Le Bigouden, was hung. She also appeared at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, in which she had eight works, a very large number for a single artist. The Société not only hung many of her paintings and drawings: she was also elected an Associate to the organisation in that year.At the end of 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond together returned to Australia. Energised by her success, Rix Nicholas purchased a car, filled its rear compartment with painting equipment, and the pair set out to paint the landscape, ranging from Canberra and the Monaro plains to the south, up into central Queensland. This included a publicity-attracting occasion where she painted figures on the beach at Bondi, reported by various publications including Australian magazine, The Home.",65c7a542ee7878b19a46a63936d71a9d,What is the last name of the individual who exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France?,Nicholas,Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond,bert,3bcd62d59ca438bb09bdf3aa3e4f19c6,What is the last name of the individual who exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France?,Nicholas,Rix Nicholas,bert,e9aea31f6fd561ec66181f360ff97de0,"What is the last name of the person who appeared at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, in which she had eight works?",Nicholas,Mrs. Rix Nicholas,bert,8e469040e64c0d58bf96b956ff00a658,"What is the last name of the person who appeared at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, in which she had eight works?",Nicholas,Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond,bert,107d7c722686f73c4e1f6bfded502f1b,"What is the last name of the person who appeared at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, in which she had eight works?",Nicholas,Rix,bert,65cb36055cdf78c3be6c38b17455df65,"What is the last name of the person who appeared at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, in which she had eight works?",Nicholas,Rix Nicholas,bert,97668fed5a6c9273ac3160494f6f466c,What is the last name of the person who painted figures on the beach at Bondi?,Nicholas,Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond,bert,20f9f3665c6d40ba2a8d19d3a7369ee3,What is the last name of the person who painted figures on the beach at Bondi?,Nicholas,Richmond,bert,dc9d572d5d2d105fb583e1b37a12af15,What is the last name of the person who painted figures on the beach at Bondi?,Nicholas,"Richmond together returned to Australia.

"For the third time, the evil Wishmaster returns to wreck the lives of more innocents. This time, his victim is a beautiful, innocent and studious teenage girl named Diana Collins who accidentally opened up the Djinn's tomb (a strange box with a jewel inside) and released him. After gaining his freedom, the Djinn is asked by Professor Barash to let him be the one who makes the wishes. The professor wishes for two of the world's loveliest ladies to be in love with him. However, as soon as the Djinn grants this wish, the women kill the professor; the Djinn takes the face off of the dead professor and is able to steal his identity. He then kills a secretary by her wishing for ""files to burn up"" but instead of the files, she burns. He takes the student file of Diana in an effort to find her and force her to fulfill her three wishes. While Diana is on the run, she must endeavor to prevent the Djinn from subjecting the entire world to Hell's wrath. While in a Church thinking it was safe, the Djinn is there instead of the priest. Her friend Ann, who is now the ""professor's Teaching Assistant"" makes the wish of ""wanting to lose a little weight"", to which she pukes up her guts in pain. Diana uses her first wish for her to stop having pain, but of course to the Djinn that means killing Ann.",5c85b192526999c5c41f9da26cc4cd62,Who is the person that wishes the secretary to burn up?,the Djinn,Diana Collins,bert,daa206d165ba7e9055a7a23b80b3e4c6,Who is the person that wishes the secretary to burn up?,the Djinn,"Djinn grants this wish, the women kill the professor; the Djinn",bert,de14766175f2b3806793e87786286796,Who is the person that wishes the secretary to burn up?,the Djinn,"Djinn grants this wish, the women kill the professor; the Djinn takes the face off of the dead professor",bert,5cd21033ca6e0970e0cfd086e07578aa,Who is the person that wishes the secretary to burn up?,the Djinn,Djinn takes the face off of the dead professor,bert,80946d7c8311c2e8eef2a72d89a69810,Who is the person that wishes the secretary to burn up?,the Djinn,Professor Barash,bert,7033c8c924f2d7cba09c96f8d612c6ee,Who is the person that wishes the secretary to burn up?,the Djinn,professor,bert,1287c2b33e499e8ba30baebd2795ddf1,Who is the professor that's friends with the girl who release the Djinn?,Ann,Barash,bert,57a4f3aa1c80e2a55c2aff0e001e2888,Who is the professor that's friends with the girl who release the Djinn?,Ann,Diana,bert,2d02fcaa2b8c210390084f1eaa70aafd,Who is the professor that's friends with the girl who release the Djinn?,Ann,Diana Collins,bert,c732e2204e7f18f18c424c687f78de46,Who is the professor that's friends with the girl who release the Djinn?,Ann,Professor Barash,bert,f5e8a1c7dd49424c886261a6c983e724,Who is the professor that's friends with the girl who release the Djinn?,Ann,"priest.

"Foreign correspondent Carey Jackson returns to New York City when his newspaper's Vienna office is closed and is offered a job on a women's magazine called Home Life. He accepts the position only because it will put him in daily contact with editor Linda Gilman, whom he once loved. Linda is averse to the idea because of his leaving her three years earlier, but agrees to hire him if he will keep their relationship on a strictly professional level. The two head for the Brinker home in Crestville, Indiana, to prepare a feature story about eldest daughter Jeanne's (Barbara Bates) wedding to Bud Mitchell for the June issue. Linda wants Carey to write a simple story about the young couple, but he insists on looking for an angle, which presents itself in the form of Jeanne's younger sister Barbara (nicknamed ""Boo"") (Betty Lynn), who confesses she always has been in love with Bud, the brother of Jeanne's former beau Jim, who was dumped by Jeanne when he joined the Army. At first Carey proposes they ask an officer he knows to order Jim home for the wedding, but thinks better of it, knowing he will lose his job if the wedding plans are disrupted. Boo, however, secretly telephones Carey's friend and arranges a leave for Jim. Complications ensue when Jim arrives home and Carey tries to get rid of him while Linda, unaware of the reality of the situation, intervenes and makes him stay. Jim and Jeanne elope, Linda fires Carey, Carey feigns interest in Boo to make Bud jealous, and the scheme succeeds, with Bud proposing to Boo. Despite losing his job, Carey writes his story, Linda realizes he always knew the truth about the couples, and the two reconcile.",65641469d70be512a8e768ba2235c616,What's the full name of the person that once loved the editor of Home Life?,Carey Jackson,"Barbara (nicknamed ""Boo"") (Betty Lynn),",bert,d776ffaadc945858a0210f50efa3e00b,What's the full name of the person that once loved the editor of Home Life?,Carey Jackson,Bud Mitchell,bert,829c4fe2d7d57b2a1eb791568eb29398,What's the full name of the person that once loved the editor of Home Life?,Carey Jackson,Foreign correspondent Carey Jackson,bert,17ebd91d6e8d43bb80f800d87f52da67,What's the full name of the person that once loved the editor of Home Life?,Carey Jackson,"Linda Gilman,",bert,e0bc79387cf70e3c7a482b22407bddc5,Who is the brother of Jeanne's fiance?,Jim,Barbara,bert,712a3f512650e7184136ae2c78e8df0c,Who is the brother of Jeanne's fiance?,Jim,"Barbara (nicknamed ""Boo"") (Betty Lynn), who confesses she always has been in love with Bud,",bert,67244f481576093b44a72fb4dbcb8609,Who is the brother of Jeanne's fiance?,Jim,Bud,bert,b502516bd3743383eb8e4ed120e7f7ca,Who is the brother of Jeanne's fiance?,Jim,"Bud, the brother of Jeanne's former beau Jim,",bert,94f9a8b4a7b84288225ae20d788f12c9,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Former FBI secretary Erin Grant loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell, who is a criminal and cost Erin her job. To afford an appeal to get her daughter back, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a strip club in Miami. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and becomes infatuated with Erin. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the congressman to settle the custody battle and help her get Angela back. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from Darrell's negligent care. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer Al Garcia begin to suspect the congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice. She tricks him into confessing on tape, and he is soon after arrested. Thus, Erin regains full custody of Angela, quits stripping, and gets back her job in the FBI. Darrell returns to prison after he is convicted of his crimes.",18b284a1df0c84805cb19da28683b9d8,What is the full name of the person that Dilbeck's staff is concerned about knowing to much?,Erin Grant,"Angela to her ex-husband Darrell,",bert,5e1ed504e0b44091f2689caea6a81732,What is the full name of the person that Dilbeck's staff is concerned about knowing to much?,Erin Grant,"Darrell,",bert,1e4eb7e51e5aae52a9a9a4f4bbfcb2d8,What is the full name of the person that Dilbeck's staff is concerned about knowing to much?,Erin Grant,David Dilbeck,bert,86e2332df35e3662c91afd7a533b4f74,What is the full name of the person that Dilbeck's staff is concerned about knowing to much?,Erin Grant,Erin,bert,7fc34534aa4d054222ac99df4a317f74,What is the full name of the person that Dilbeck's staff is concerned about knowing to much?,Erin Grant,"Erin Grant loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell,",bert,4d5ded5addb4df92e9fab3fd4ced97f9,What is the full name of the person who tricks the congressman to confess on tape?,Erin Grant,Al Garcia,bert,a2d08a0bc1df06d5994b0fa8e446f67f,What is the full name of the person who tricks the congressman to confess on tape?,Erin Grant,David Dilbeck,bert,0edec0a97f84f07a93917e7f5e493640,What is the full name of the person who tricks the congressman to confess on tape?,Erin Grant,"Erin Grant loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell,",bert,584dfc8b467bc90e6c8b39e7c7401642,What is the full name of the person who tricks the congressman to confess on tape?,Erin Grant,Garcia,bert,73e42a59d997ec9bb73d86e239fb243a,What is the full name of the person who tricks the congressman to confess on tape?,Erin Grant,a police officer Al Garcia,bert,187250289ba342c8bf85ed32f9d3a5c9,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Frankie Bono, a mentally disturbed hitman from Cleveland, comes back to his hometown in New York City during Christmas week to kill a middle-management mobster, Troiano. The assassination will be risky, with Frankie being warned by a fellow enforcer that should he be spotted before the hit is performed, the contract will be reneged. First he follows his target to select the best possible location, but opts to wait until Troiano isn't being accompanied by his bodyguards. Next, he goes to purchase a revolver from Big Ralph, an obese gun runner who keeps sewer rats as pets. The encounter with this old acquaintance leaves Frankie feeling disgusted. With several hours left before the hit is to be performed, Frankie decides to kill time in the city, where he is plagued by memories of past trauma during his time living there. While sitting alone for a drink, Frankie is reunited with childhood friend Petey, who invites the reluctant Frankie to a Christmas party, where Frankie later encounters his old flame, Lori. The following day Frankie goes to see Lori at her apartment to get better reacquainted with her, but the visit ends in disaster when an at first vulnerable Frankie suddenly attempts to sexually assault her. Lori forgives Frankie for his actions and calmly asks him to leave, to which he obliges. That same day, Frankie tails Troiano and his mistress to a Jazz club in Greenwich village. However, he is spotted by Big Ralph, who decides to blackmail Frankie out of the hit. In turn, Frankie stalks Ralph back to his tenement and strangles him to death following a violent brawl between the two. Losing his nerve, Frankie calls up his employers to tell them he wants to quit the job.

"From 1987 to 1992, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty released music under names including The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs) and The KLF.  Following a run of five consecutive UK top-five singles, The KLF executed a high-profile retirement from the music business and deleted their entire back catalogue, declaring that ""For the foreseeable future, there will be no further record releases from any past, present or future name attached to our activities.""  Drummond and Cauty's subsequent art project, the K Foundation, disposed of The KLF's earnings, including by burning one million pounds of it, money which was originally provisionally earmarked by the duo for millennial celebrations. Bill Drummond: ""Originally we were going to invest the whole lot in some capital growth fund and spend it all on one big event, maybe at the millennium"".In the four years following The KLF's retirement, Drummond and Cauty's musical output consisted only of a limited edition single released in Israel and Palestine (""K Cera Cera""), and a contribution to The Help Album (""The Magnificent""). In 1997, British artist Jeremy Deller pioneered the Acid Brass concept, collaborating with the Williams Fairey Brass Band to interpret and perform classic acid house tracks as brass arrangements.  Deller was described by one source as a prankster, a notion frequently applied to Drummond and Cauty themselves.  In February 1997, Drummond was contacted by his former Big in Japan bandmate Jayne Casey, who was helping to organise an arts festival in Liverpool and had noticed that Acid Brass' repertoire included The KLF's ""What Time Is Love?"".  Drummond attended the festival performance and heard ""What Time Is Love?"" performed as the encore, during which he telephoned Cauty.  Cauty and Drummond together attended a 19 April Acid Brass performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London.  Collaborative work ensued between Drummond, Cauty, and Deller, in which the Acid Brass rendition of their track was incorporated into a composition designed to mark the tenth anniversary of Drummond and Cauty's first work.",07ef218a65aebfc33c03fc70e04cbb16,What are the first names of the three people collaborative work ensued between?,Bill,Bill Drummond and Jimmy,bert,9b510a62b7442ea4aba4a3ab268c1610,What are the first names of the three people collaborative work ensued between?,Bill,"Cauty,",bert,815090143981ae89fecfbd886bb3f023,What are the first names of the three people collaborative work ensued between?,Bill,"Drummond, Cauty,",bert,074f924dbb47e659081a47bb70832c4b,What are the first names of the three people collaborative work ensued between?,Bill,Jeremy,bert,b5d0da827d82a88f51612444be78074e,What are the first names of the three people collaborative work ensued between?,Bill,Jimmy,bert,e0ee425e0c4722b310a97638074d7472,"What is the first name of the person who attended the festival performance and heard ""What Time Is Love?"" performed as the encore?",Bill,Bill Drummond and Jimmy,bert,5c234799ea18c71ca79fab3d6818f2b7,"What is the first name of the person who attended the festival performance and heard ""What Time Is Love?"" performed as the encore?",Bill,Cauty.,bert,443ac50b556d566808ee6e5656839dec,"What is the first name of the person who attended the festival performance and heard ""What Time Is Love?"" performed as the encore?",Bill,Jayne,bert,04aa914f8bbb6159e00d5fa89654615f,"What is the first name of the person who attended the festival performance and heard ""What Time Is Love?"" performed as the encore?",Bill,Jeremy,bert,a253a72cc9e1d1cb9e9b97acc5fbf4d6,"What is the first name of the person who attended the festival performance and heard ""What Time Is Love?"" performed as the encore?",Bill,Jimmy,bert,83cb9705a1e9fde0c742699f398305ca,What is the first name of the person who was telephoned during the encore of the festival?,Jimmy,Bill,bert,cb5131c535a5dcded0e5d427b90c2671,What is the first name of the person who was telephoned during the encore of the festival?,Jimmy,Bill Drummond and Jimmy,bert,eced22405e2dbbf8edb889503d478c26,What is the first name of the person who was telephoned during the encore of the festival?,Jimmy,Jayne,bert,c97c71faffdda5c838fafdbbe88522c2,What is the first name of the person who was telephoned during the encore of the festival?,Jimmy,"Jayne Casey,",bert,f1c44e725e75cf5d3a25ec7bb7ae9c47,What is the first name of the person who was telephoned during the encore of the festival?,Jimmy,Jeremy,bert,12792e7b26a79b4d54858c3349826a77,What is the first name of the person who was was contacted by his former Big in Japan bandmate Jayne Casey?,Bill,Bill Drummond and Jimmy,bert,7a644782fdad1df388289f3e65c8d494,What is the first name of the person who was was contacted by his former Big in Japan bandmate Jayne Casey?,Bill,"Cauty themselves.

"Frusciante wrote and recorded a plethora of songs during and after the By the Way tour. In February 2004, he started a side project with Joe Lally of Fugazi and Josh Klinghoffer, called Ataxia. The group was together for about two weeks, during which they recorded about ninety minutes of material. After two days in the recording studio, they played two shows at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, and spent two more days in the studio before disbanding. Later that year, five songs provided by Frusciante appeared on The Brown Bunny soundtrack. Frusciante released his fourth full-length solo album Shadows Collide with People on February 24, 2004. This featured guest appearances from some of his friends, including Klinghoffer, and Chili Peppers bandmates Smith and Flea. In June 2004, he announced that he would be releasing six records over six months: The Will to Death, Ataxia's Automatic Writing, DC EP, Inside of Emptiness, A Sphere in the Heart of Silence and Curtains. With the release of Curtains Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004, for the track ""The Past Recedes"". He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape, avoiding modern studio and computer-assisted recording processes. Frusciante noted, ""These six records were recorded in a period of six months after coming home from touring with the Chili Peppers for one-and-a-half years. I made a list of all the songs I had and they totaled about seventy. My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that I had.

"George Harrison began writing ""Something"" in September 1968, during a session for the Beatles' self-titled double album, also known as ""the White Album"". In his autobiography, I, Me Mine, he recalls working on the melody on a piano, at the same time as Paul McCartney recorded overdubs in a neighbouring studio at London's Abbey Road Studios. Harrison suspended work on the song, believing that with the tune having come to him so easily, it might have been a melody from another song. In I, Me, Mine, he wrote that the middle eight ""took some time to sort out"". The opening lyric was taken from the title of ""Something in the Way She Moves"", a track by Harrison's fellow Apple Records artist James Taylor. While Harrison imagined the composition in the style of Ray Charles, his inspiration for ""Something"" was his wife, Pattie Boyd. In her 2007 autobiography, Wonderful Today, Boyd recalls: ""He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful ..."" Boyd discusses the song's popularity among other recording artists and concludes: ""My favourite [version] was the one by George Harrison, which he played to me in the kitchen at Kinfauns.""Having begun to write love songs that were directed at both God and a woman, with his White Album track ""Long, Long, Long"", Harrison later cited alternative sources for his inspiration for ""Something"". In early 1969, according to author Joshua Greene, Harrison told his friends from the Hare Krishna Movement that the song was about the Hindu deity Krishna; in an interview with Rolling Stone in 1976, he said of his approach to writing love songs: ""all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in her that you see."" By 1996, Harrison had denied writing ""Something"" for Boyd.

"George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English songwriter, singer, bassist, and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. Waters initially served solely as the bassist, but following the departure of songwriter Syd Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist, co-lead vocalist, and conceptual leader. Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979). By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over the use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987. Waters' solo work includes the studio albums The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984), Radio K.A.O.S. (1987), Amused to Death (1992), and Is This the Life We Really Want? (2017). In 2005, he released Ça Ira, an opera translated from Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gils' libretto about the French Revolution. In 1990, Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, The Wall – Live in Berlin, with an attendance of 450,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the U.S. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Mason, Wright and David Gilmour for the Live 8 global awareness event, the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999; he performed The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety for his world tour of 2006–2008, and in 2010 began the Wall Live tour, the highest-grossing of all time by a solo artist.",9e36a154846487df8567f53353a6bdc3,What is the last name of the person who co-founded Pink Floyd?,Waters,"Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, The Wall –",bert,051a287e41873a709efc027fc355f478,What is the last name of the person who re-united with his ex-bandmates for the Live 8 Global Awareness Event?,Waters,"Mason,",bert,3930960431199ac68c03be491343a079,What is the last name of the person who re-united with his ex-bandmates for the Live 8 Global Awareness Event?,Waters,"Mason, Wright and David Gilmour for the Live 8 global awareness event, the group's first appearance with Waters",bert,e76e3f427e3d0aa8e20957b699654fc8,What is the last name of the person who released Ça Ira in 2005?,Waters,"Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, The Wall –",bert,beeab0853e0bc5935ceb1240f7397536,What is the last name of the person who was inducted into the U.S. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996?,Waters,The Wall,bert,611fbd2f4698b06adba86fd5622756ae,What is the last name of the person who was inducted into the U.S. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996?,Waters,"Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, The Wall",bert,f80d4a9ee219f31807995b5486930404,What is the last name of the person who was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005?,Waters,"Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, The Wall – Live in Berlin,",bert,a9d45549fbbf328318d6e4211fb7ff1c,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Ghosts I–IV is the sixth studio album by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on March 2, 2008 by The Null Corporation. It was the band's first independent release, following their split from longtime label Interscope Records the prior year. The album's production team included Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, studio collaborators Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder, and instrumental contributions from Alessandro Cortini, Adrian Belew, and Brian Viglione. Reznor described the music of Ghosts as ""a soundtrack for daydreams"", a sentiment echoed by critics, who compared it to the work of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp. The tracks are unnamed, identified only by their track listing and group number, and is an almost entirely instrumental album. Although initially intended to be a five-track EP, the final release consisted of four nine-track EPs, totaling 36 tracks. The album was released under a Creative Commons license (BY-NC-SA) and in a variety of differing packages and price points, including a US$300 ""Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition"", without prior announcement. A user-generated ""film festival"" was also announced, inviting fans to visually interpret the music and post their submissions. The album received a favorable reception from critics, who complimented its experimental nature and unorthodox release method, although some viewed the former as its weak point. The album reached number 14 in the US, and was nominated for two Grammy Awards (Best Rock Instrumental Performance and Best Box Set or Limited Edition Package) representing the first time music released under a Creative Commons license had been nominated for a Grammy Award.",5eea8635cb29a8426cf62e7eb1a44628,What specific catorgories was Ghosts I-IV nominated for?,Best Rock Instrumental Performance,Grammy Awards,bert,de1f7ddb0a8f13d34866c37ca4125654,What specific catorgories was Ghosts I-IV nominated for?,Best Rock Instrumental Performance,Grammy Awards (Best Rock Instrumental Performance,bert,357fbb51111035f359e9fa7be71cff94,What specific catorgories was Ghosts I-IV nominated for?,Best Rock Instrumental Performance,two Grammy,bert,1fafdd20211ebdf9c16cb735b978ac93,What specific catorgories was Ghosts I-IV nominated for?,Best Rock Instrumental Performance,two Grammy Awards,bert,baabbe2f946d349feedad51af2286e46,What specific catorgories was Ghosts I-IV nominated for?,Best Rock Instrumental Performance,two Grammy Awards (Best Rock Instrumental Performance,bert,0488d77f775842a6f0ef8d0aa899cc24,What was the full name of the album that was compared to the works of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp?,Ghosts I–IV,Ghosts,bert,ab5f01fe863db0407292ebdebb5bc934,What was the full name of the album that was compared to the works of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp?,Ghosts I–IV,I–IV,bert,c683bd938ba15948c09cadd7a04ea048,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"God Hates Us All was originally intended to be named Soundtrack to the Apocalypse. However, Araya suggested that the title would be better used for a box set, which the band released in 2003. The phrase God Hates Us All originates from the song ""Disciple"", during which the line is repeated over the chorus. The lyrics are in reference to God's allowance of acts such as suicide and terrorism, while seemingly doing nothing to prevent them (see problem of evil). A member of the heavy metal band Pantera suggested using ""God Hates Us All"" for a shirt design after King played the song to the band. King agreed, although he thought the phrase would have more impact as the album title. The original album cover depicts a Bible spiked with nails placed in a pentagram star shape, covered in blood with the word ""Slayer"" burnt across it. The liner notes intersperse the lyrics between passages from the biblical Book of Job, partly crossed out with a black marker. The idea was suggested by the band's record company, although King wanted  more time to develop a better cover. King's concept for the cover was to show nails in the shape of a pentagram, and have them miss keywords in Bible verses so it appeared as if it had been created by a sociopath who knew where every word appears. He later complained that the outcome was typical of ""a record company with absolutely no idea what the fuck they were going to do"", and said that the cover ""looked like a seventh grader defaced the Bible."" A slip insert was placed in front of the covers in major retail outlets.",9ee950100db397c1449f16cd71279d40,What is the name of the band that released God Hates Us All?,Slayer,Pantera,bert,26653c3751fb70f320b8d4342aa068cc,What is the name of the band that released God Hates Us All?,Slayer,Soundtrack to the Apocalypse.,bert,076039d5f14264b49e0d2c58714640a1,What is the name of the band that released God Hates Us All?,Slayer,nails,bert,96d42c3d123bf86fcfbc22769746a73d,What is the name of the band that released God Hates Us All?,Slayer,tera,bert,2bad45803ef8876a5f15b3a8ec5315ed,Which title did Araya suggest would be better for a box set?,Soundtrack to the Apocalypse,Apocalypse.,bert,66607e08bac5e5b903c8f0ed1c8e577a,Which title did Araya suggest would be better for a box set?,Soundtrack to the Apocalypse,God Hates Us All,bert,c8e76fc79f1bbfbe6431d5867846c3e4,Which title did Araya suggest would be better for a box set?,Soundtrack to the Apocalypse,God Hates Us All was originally intended to be named Soundtrack to the Apocalypse.,bert,5269aa1c2e70de77b54bdd9f78fa4a43,Which title did Araya suggest would be better for a box set?,Soundtrack to the Apocalypse,Soundtrack,bert,124aa4ac3e90cc3831047e3390a28332,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Growing Up Smith is a coming-of-age story of Smith, a 10-year-old boy from India growing up in small-town America in 1979. As the boy's family tries to straddle the fine line between embracing the American Dream and preserving their Indian heritage, the awkward little hero sneaks out for a taste of Kentucky Fried Chicken (even though his family is vegetarian), dons a Saturday Night Fever costume, and contends with his parents as they send him to school with a yellow squash instead of a pumpkin to carve for Halloween. And as Smith falls head-over-heels in love with Amy, the girl-next-door, he finds in Amy's father Butch the all-American cowboy he wishes his own father could be. But alas, when Smith goes on a hunting adventure with Butch, Butch injures himself while chasing a doe.  Smith's rescuing Butch makes him a local hero, but also strains his relationship with his father.  With Butch unable to work, his wife decides to move away from the house and takes Amy with her.  Amy, unable to deal with the turmoil in her own family, threatens to run away.  Smith leaves the house on his bike to meet up with her, though Butch arrives soon after and prevents her from doing so.  Smith's parents, in the meantime, search for him and find his sister making out with a boy.  Furious, they condemn his sister to studying, and upon Smith's return banish him back to India after he declares his love for Amy.  Nineteen years pass in India, with Smith becoming a neurosurgeon and finding a woman to marry.  Smith's wife dies of a complication - though unknown - that Smith himself tries to cure.",f0dde7973743b40e2b03f75daec17972,Who sneaks out for a taste of KFC?,Smith,"Smith is a coming-of-age story of Smith,",bert,9016700bc4d69a414296e36eb1f5ab5c,Who sneaks out for a taste of KFC?,Smith,"the boy's family tries to straddle the fine line between embracing the American Dream and preserving their Indian heritage, the awkward little hero",bert,87e5ae032b13e5450dce7050dd83c017,Who wants to be sent to school with a yellow squash to carve for Halloween?,Smith,"Smith is a coming-of-age story of Smith,",bert,723a0ed10a53c53ed6de7b69e04fde7a,Who wants to be sent to school with a yellow squash to carve for Halloween?,Smith,hero,bert,6d65101cdff6c6c4c7cf1fa978af4ab9,Who wants to be sent to school with a yellow squash to carve for Halloween?,Smith,his parents as they send him to school with a yellow squash instead of a pumpkin to carve for Halloween.

"Harrison first introduced ""Something"" at a Beatles session on 19 September 1968, when he played it to George Martin's stand-in as producer of The Beatles, Chris Thomas, while the latter was working out the harpsichord part for Harrison's track ""Piggies"". Despite Thomas's enthusiasm for the new composition, Harrison chose to focus on ""Piggies"". He told Thomas that he intended to offer ""Something"" to singer Jackie Lomax, whose debut album Harrison was producing for Apple Records. ""Something"" was not among the tracks released on Lomax's album, however, much of which was recorded in Los Angeles following the completion of the White Album.After Harrison rejoined the Beatles in January 1969 for their Get Back film project (later released as Let It Be), ""Something"" was one of many recent compositions that he offered to the group. Leng describes this period as a prolific one for Harrison as a songwriter, comparing it with John Lennon's peak of creativity over 1963–64, yet Harrison's songs received little interest from Lennon and McCartney amid the tense, uncooperative atmosphere within the band. Martin was also unimpressed by ""Something"" at first, considering it ""too weak and derivative"", according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore.The Beatles rehearsed the song at Apple Studio on 28 January. With the proceedings being recorded by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg for the planned documentary film, tapes reveal Harrison discussing his unfinished lyrics for ""Something"" with Lennon and McCartney, since he had been unable to complete the song's second line, which begins ""Attracts me ..."" To serve as a temporary filler, Lennon suggested ""like a cauliflower"", which Harrison then altered to ""like a pomegranate"".

"Hazards stemming from volcanic activity at Ubinas are mainly the fallout from explosive eruptions, lahars of different origins, large landslides that can generate debris flows and pyroclastic flows. Small explosive eruptions are the most likely occurrences at Ubinas, while large Plinian eruptions are considerably less likely. The area of the cone itself is the area most likely to be affected by volcanic phenomena, while pyroclastic flows and lahars are a danger for the valleys that drain Ubinas in southeastern direction and landslides are hazardous for an area of the southern flank. The town closest to the volcano is only 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) away from Ubinas. Large Plinian eruptions could have effects on the city of Arequipa.The Peruvian INGEMMET geological service monitors the seismic activity, any deformation of the mountain, and hot spring and gas composition at Ubinas. It regularly publishes a report on the activity of Ubinas. Hazard maps were created during the 2006 eruptive event to show the relative risk in various locations around the volcano, which is graded in a three-zone scheme with one high-risk, one intermediate-risk and one low-risk zone. A contingency map was created to show and explain the procedures to follow in case of various eruption scenarios. Both maps were widely disseminated after publication to aid in the response to future eruptions.",7f97efa231bb565cae2b5eb96099b561,What is the name of the thing that contingency and hazard maps made for?,Ubinas,Ubinas.

"Head girl Justine Fielding is escorted out of Fairview High School by the police, as other pupils look on. Five days earlier, Justine is reading at the funeral of unpopular, asthmatic student Darren Mullet. She starts to talk about him, when Mullet's equally unpopular friend, Jason Banks (Olly Alexander), stands up in church and angrily calls her a hypocrite because she did not really know him. He is then thrown out by the sadistic P.E. teacher. Later on, Justine is talking to her friend Helena when school heart-throb Alex decides to invite her to a party that his popular friends, Bradley, Tasha, Khalillah, Sophie and Marcus are having. She decides to go. At the party, when Justine arrives, Tasha tells Jez, the DJ, to say something about her appearance. He begins to rap about her in an unflattering manner. When Alex tells him to stop, he is literally thrown out of the party by Bradley. Later, Alex and Justine go to one of the bedrooms and kiss. Meanwhile, Bradley, Tasha, Khalillah, Marcus and Sophie all receive insulting and degrading text messages from Mullet's number. During this, someone puts on a clown costume and grabs a chainsaw, before heading up to Alex and Justine. It turns out to be Bradley, who is pranking them.

"Henry Altmann is stuck in Brooklyn traffic while on his way to a doctor's appointment. His car is suddenly struck by a taxi, which propels him into a rage which he unleashes upon the taxi driver. Henry goes to the Brooklyn hospital, where Dr. Sharon Gill is covering for his usual doctor, with whom she is having an affair. After examining scans of his brain, Sharon informs Henry that he has a brain aneurysm and his outlook is bad. Henry erupts, throwing insults at Sharon and demanding that she tell him how long he has to live. She tries to dodge the question, but Henry is persistent. Panicking, Sharon tells him that he will die in ninety minutes. Henry leaves the hospital in a rage.  Sharon talks with another doctor and realizes the consequences of her actions; she will surely be fired and lose her license. Sharon resolves to find Henry and put him into immediate care. Henry arrives at the family law firm of Altmann, and storms into a meeting between his brother Aaron and  several older clients. He asks what a hypothetical client with only ninety minutes to live should do, they reply that the client should make love to his wife one last time. Henry then decides to run home to see his estranged wife, Bette, only to find that she is having an affair with their neighbor.

"High school French teacher Sabine reads to her class as a translation exercise a French newspaper report of a terrorist who planted a bomb in the airline luggage of his pregnant girlfriend. If the bomb had detonated, it would have killed her, her unborn child, and many others, but it was discovered in time by Israeli security personnel.  Egoyan based the story partly on the 1986 Hindawi affair.In the course of translating, Simon, who lives with his maternal uncle Tom, imagines that the news item is his own family's story: that his Palestinian father Sami was the terrorist, the woman was his mother Rachel, an accomplished violinist, and he was her unborn child. Years ago, Sami crashed the family car, killing both himself and Rachel, making Simon an orphan. Influenced by his maternal grandfather, Morris, who disliked Sami, Simon has always feared that the crash was not an accident but intentional. Sabine asks him to develop the story as a drama exercise, to read it to the class, and for dramatic effect to pretend that it really happened. He does so, and discussions evolve on the Internet about the story. Sabine is fired for making Simon lie. Tom, who is a tow truck driver, tows Sabine's car away. Sabine follows him in a taxi, and by mobile phone she offers him a meal in a restaurant. Later she reveals to him that she had been married to Sami for 5 years, until Sami met Rachel.",7cdf2a323fd2441fb9ae6da098b4aeab,Whose father was the French teacher once married to?,Simon,"Rachel,",bert,2c646b2864e1444f654963c8e3f1800c,Whose father was the French teacher once married to?,Simon,Sabine,bert,ff000a30dfe1147b671204341c850f6f,Whose father was the French teacher once married to?,Simon,Sami,bert,1a1be675443c5427eab2060bf1397df9,Whose father was the French teacher once married to?,Simon,"Sami for 5 years, until Sami met Rachel.",bert,7abcec5cdb06d2f95eda78fed2c2fc6e,Whose father was the French teacher once married to?,Simon,"Sami was the terrorist, the woman was his mother Rachel,",bert,e0ac4819a4532c3480699bc2b38f0e55,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Hilda Rix Nicholas (née Rix, later Wright, 1 September 1884 – 3 August 1961) was an Australian artist. Hilda Rix was born in the Victorian city of Ballarat. Her father was an education administrator and poet, her mother was a musician and artist. She studied under a leading member of the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin, at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905 and was an early member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Following the death of her father in 1907, Hilda Rix, her only sibling Elsie and her mother travelled to Europe where she undertook further study in London and then in Paris. Her teachers during the period included John Hassall, Richard Emil Miller and Théophile Steinlen. After travelling to Tangiers in 1912, Rix held several successful exhibitions of her work, with one drawing, Grande marche, Tanger, purchased by the French government. She was one of the first Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, was made a member of the Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français, and had works hung in the Paris Salon first in 1911 and again in 1913. The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of World War I. A period of personal tragedy followed, as Rix's sister died in 1914, then her mother in 1915. In 1916 she met and married George Matson Nicholas, only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the Western Front. Returning to Australia in 1918, Rix Nicholas once more took up professional painting, and held an exhibition of over a hundred works at Melbourne's Guild Hall. Many sold, including In Picardy, purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Following a period painting in rural locations in the early 1920s, Rix Nicholas returned to Europe. A 1925 exhibition in Paris led to the sale of her work In Australia to the Musée du Luxembourg, followed by an extensive tour of her paintings around regional British art galleries. There followed representation in other exhibitions, including at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and the Royal Academy of Arts, both in London. Following the inclusion of several works in the 1926 Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris she was made an Associate of that organisation.",b194d44d0be3dc926d8b8d6273639177,What is the full name of the person who studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School?,Hilda Rix Nicholas,Hilda Rix,bert,c8accf04dbd96b3a20afcdf72380c820,What is the full name of the person who studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School?,Hilda Rix Nicholas,"Hilda Rix Nicholas (née Rix,",bert,96737b0c7b2fc76eb6e520f3954dfc4f,What is the full name of the person who studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School?,Hilda Rix Nicholas,"Hilda Rix Nicholas (née Rix, later Wright, 1 September 1884 – 3 August 1961) was an Australian artist.

"Hillsboro () is the fifth-largest city in the State of Oregon and is the county seat of Washington County. Lying in the Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area, the city hosts many high-technology companies, such as Intel, that comprise what has become known as the Silicon Forest. At the 2010 Census, the city's population was 91,611.For thousands of years before the arrival of European-American settlers, the Atfalati tribe of the Kalapuya lived in the Tualatin Valley near the later site of Hillsboro. The climate, moderated by the Pacific Ocean, helped make the region suitable for fishing, hunting, food gathering, and agriculture. Settlers founded a community here in 1842, later named after David Hill, an Oregon politician. Transportation by riverboat on the Tualatin River was part of Hillsboro's settler economy. A railroad reached the area in the early 1870s and an interurban electric railway about four decades later. These railways, as well as highways, aided the slow growth of the city to about 2,000 people by 1910 and about 5,000 by 1950, before the arrival of high-tech companies in the 1980s. Hillsboro has a council–manager government consisting of a city manager and a city council headed by a mayor. In addition to high-tech industry, sectors important to Hillsboro's economy are health care, retail sales, and agriculture, including grapes and wineries. The city operates more than twenty parks and the mixed-use Hillsboro Stadium, and ten sites in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Modes of transportation include private vehicles, public buses and light rail, and aircraft using the Hillsboro Airport. The city is home to Pacific University's Health Professions Campus. Notable residents include two Oregon governors.",206774c12da60cb8246389f5b5930f67,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,Hillsboro () is the fifth-largest city in the State of Oregon,bert,cbfdfd522e6e938f98555f393591c26a,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,Oregon,bert,179e2619f27b0ca33aac34a07eabbb40,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,Portland,bert,aadac90c04a71338b772d1c1f80927b7,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,State of Oregon,bert,13501602c74c9507448139592336b309,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland,bert,4c493c14dcc1bac76dbcaa1112fd4b66,What city was named after David?,Hillsboro,Hillsboro () is the fifth-largest city in the State of Oregon,bert,10766d0ee27b76a81a6f6a4f575a1355,What city was named after David?,Hillsboro,Hillsboro's,bert,5b2537f81a0936c80aed6b277d197794,What city was named after David?,Hillsboro,Tualatin Valley near the later site of Hillsboro.,bert,1d5842eb293659e3b6ebecae6ecbb49f,What city was named after David?,Hillsboro,boro,bert,b54160a6ff35a7692087084b165d855b,What is on the east side of Hillsboro?,the Portland metropolitan area,Pacific University's Health Professions Campus.,bert,d10c424dec6624eecaf0c6408c5ca849,What is on the east side of Hillsboro?,the Portland metropolitan area,Tualatin Valley,bert,5369d2ba2b506b7cafdba118cd8881ac,What is on the east side of Hillsboro?,the Portland metropolitan area,"Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area,",bert,578b4854d6a98c99de973be87b8b1c02,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Houses in rural Ratanakiri are made from bamboo, rattan, wood, saek, and kanma leaves, all of which are collected from nearby forests; they typically last for around three years. Village spatial organization varies by ethnic group. Kreung villages are constructed in a circular manner, with houses facing inwards toward a central meeting house.  In Jarai villages, vast longhouses are inhabited by all extended families, with the inner house divided into smaller compartments.  Tampuan villages may follow either pattern.Nearly all Khmer Loeu are animist, and their cosmologies are intertwined with the natural world. Some forests are believed to be inhabited by local spirits, and local taboos forbid cutting in those areas. Within spirit forests, certain natural features such as rock formations, waterfalls, pools, and vegetation are sacred. Major sacrificial festivals in Ratanakiri occur during March and April, when fields are selected and prepared for the new planting season. Christian missionaries are present in the province, and some Khmer Loeu have converted to Christianity. The region's ethnic Khmer are Buddhist. There is also a small Muslim community, consisting mainly of ethnic Cham.Because of the province's high prevalence of malaria and its distance from regional centers, Ratanakiri was isolated from Western influences until the late 20th century. Major cultural shifts have occurred in recent years however, particularly in villages near roads and district towns; these changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials, and NGO workers. Clothing and diets are becoming more standardized, and traditional music is being displaced by Khmer music.  Many villagers have also observed a loss of respect for elders and a growing divide between the young and the old. Young people have begun to refuse to abide by traditional rules and have stopped believing in spirits.",fea9585c30b593df8d38d3599fb9860a,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,Major,bert,3148579d2195d1ab2462e6f826f4799b,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,Major cultural,bert,88e4cd1ba8bcc8ecfda33cb83deb2e10,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,cultural,bert,2e062476626ade5723d3926bbdd647b4,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,cultural shifts,bert,8e64ffa0d82d76479d8d6bf395889927,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,shifts,bert,fdd1d2e5055a98daa70cba6bec9fbbce,What types of housing are used by Tampuan villages?,longhouses,"Jarai villages, vast longhouses",bert,150272f0a2b2362a5dcd6759480ed86e,What types of housing are used by Tampuan villages?,longhouses,"Kreung villages are constructed in a circular manner, with houses facing inwards toward a central meeting house.

"In 1630s New England, English settler William and his family — wife Katherine, daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas — are banished from a Puritan Plymouth Colony over a religious dispute. They build a farm near a large, secluded forest and Katherine has a newborn child, Samuel. One day, Thomasin is playing peekaboo with Samuel when the baby abruptly disappears. It is revealed that a witch had stolen the unbaptized Samuel and that night kills him and uses his blood and fat to make a flying ointment.Katherine, devastated, spends her days crying and praying, while William insists a wolf stole the baby. Even though Katherine forbids the children going to the forest, William takes Caleb to lay a trap for food. Caleb asks if Samuel's unbaptized soul will reach Heaven. William chastises Caleb for raising the question and later reveals to Caleb that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her cup while implying Thomasin was responsible for Samuel's vanishing. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family. Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check the trap in the forest. She forces Caleb to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. While walking in the woods, they spot a hare, which sends their horse Burt into a panic and their dog Fowler promptly chases. Caleb runs off after the pair, while the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon Fowler's disemboweled body. As he gets deeper into the woods, he comes across a hovel, where a beautiful young woman emerges and seduces him. William finds Thomasin and takes her home. Katherine angrily chastises Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods and, to save Thomasin, William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's silver cup.",95856c457d005ec2688d8a5c97566f64,What is the name of the family pet that chases the rabbit?,Fowler,Burt,bert,af029a4df3a628f7ee1e4a6beb7a84c2,What is the name of the family pet that chases the rabbit?,Fowler,Burt into a panic and their dog Fowler,bert,c1c396a8cf8b831dd996ebb4ff8046d7,What is the name of the family pet that chases the rabbit?,Fowler,Fowler promptly chases.

"In 1783, Kitty is caught trying to pick the pocket of the painter Thomas Gainsborough. He offers to pay her more to sit for a portrait for him. There, she attracts the attention of Sir Hugh Marcy and the Earl of Carstairs. Sir Hugh, upon finding out her real social status, offers her a job as a scullery maid. Kitty learns that he is impoverished, having lost his post in the foreign office due to a scandal. Gainsborough's portrait, The Anonymous Lady, creates a stir, as people try to guess who the subject is. The Duke of Malmunster buys both that painting and Gainsborough's The Blue Boy. When the duke asks Gainsborough who the model is, Sir Hugh claims she is his aunt's ward. The duke admits he may have been mistaken in having Sir Hugh dismissed from his position (in favor of the duke's nephew), and in exchange for an introduction to Kitty ""Gordon"", offers to reinstate him. Sir Hugh, who had planned to avenge his dismissal, changes his mind in favor of monetary gain. He and his aunt, Lady Susan Dowitt, teach Kitty how to pose as a lady of fashion. What Sir Hugh does not count on is the attraction Kitty develops for him. When Hugh is sent to debtors' prison, Kitty charms the wealthy ironmonger Jonathan Selby into marrying her, using part of her dowry to free Hugh. Hugh is furious, but has to accept the situation. Hugh and Lady Susan soon spend the rest of the dowry and go back into debt. Kitty breaks into her husband's strongbox to get the pair out of debt, but Selby finds out and starts beating her.

"In 1792 during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, a secret league of brave Englishmen are rescuing French aristocrats from the guillotine. The leader of this secret society is a mysterious English nobleman known only as the Scarlet Pimpernel, whose signature sign is a humble wayside flower. In society he hides his identity by posing as the wealthy but foppish and seemingly empty-headed Sir Percy Blakeney. After rescuing the Count de Beaulieu and his family, Percy is introduced to the beautiful French actress Marguerite St. Just (Jane Seymour) through her brother, Armand, whom he rescued from an attack. Percy is attracted to Marguerite, but she is in a relationship with Paul Chauvelin, an agent of Maximilien Robespierre. Due to the Scarlet Pimpernel's past successes, Chauvelin is assigned to discover his identity and capture him. After Percy and his associates smuggle another aristocrat out of the city while picnicking with Marguerite, Chauvelin deduces that the Scarlet Pimpernel must be an English nobleman, and tries to coerce the Count de Tournay to spy on the English court for the Republic. Later, Marguerite and Chauvelin have an argument over the executions and he angrily departs.

"In 1814 Young first exchanged correspondence about the stone with Jean-François Champollion, a teacher at Grenoble who had produced a scholarly work on ancient Egypt. Champollion saw copies of the brief hieroglyphic and Greek inscriptions of the Philae obelisk in 1822, on which William John Bankes had tentatively noted the names ""Ptolemaios"" and ""Kleopatra"" in both languages. From this, Champollion identified the phonetic characters k l e o p a t r a (in today's transliteration q l i҆ w p ꜣ d r ꜣ.t). On the basis of this and the foreign names on the Rosetta Stone, he quickly constructed an alphabet of phonetic hieroglyphic characters, which appears in his famous 1822 ""Lettre à M. Dacier"" sent to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Paris Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and immediately published by the Académie. In the postscript Champollion notes that similar phonetic characters seemed to occur in both Greek and Egyptian names, a hypothesis confirmed in 1823, when he identified the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches at Abu Simbel. These far older hieroglyphic inscriptions had been copied by Bankes and sent to Champollion by Jean-Nicolas Huyot. From this point, the stories of the Rosetta Stone and the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs diverge, as Champollion drew on many other texts to develop an Ancient Egyptian grammar and a hieroglyphic dictionary which were published after his death in 1832.",fcc92946419c20bec5c3d6e1b640eff2,What is the full name of the author of Lettre à M.

"In 1856, Townsend Harris is sent by President Franklin Pierce to serve as the first U.S. Consul General to Japan, following the treaty written by Commodore Matthew Perry two years before. Accompanied only by his translator-secretary, Huesken, Townsend comes ashore at the town of Shimoda prefecture, as specified in the treaty as the location for an American consulate. However, the Japanese governor refuses to accept his credentials, denying him any official status, due to a conflict between interpretations of the treaty terms. While Harris believes that the Consul shall be present whenever either country requires, the Japanese believe the terms to permit a consul only when both countries require. The governor holds to his interpretation, largely because of objections over the threats under which the treaty was forced upon them. Harris is permitted to remain in Shimoda, but only as a private citizen, with no recognition of his official status. He is provided the use of an abandoned home, adjacent to the town cemetery. The governor explains that, in the two years following Perry's visit, various natural disasters had taken place. Some Japanese believed them to be warnings from the gods to avoid foreign influences.  In the weeks that follow, Harris is the target of distrust and hostility, to the extent that Tamura orders townspeople to not even sell him food. Some in Japan wanted the country opened, but many others feared the corruption of foreign influences, and invasion by the barbarians of other lands. For this reason, Harris is not permitted to leave Shimoda, nor to go any closer to the capitol in Edo, 100 miles away.",1635aedbffb178a1f2157f9f9461df67,What is the last name of the person who comes ashore in Shimoda prefecture with his translator?,Harris,"Harris is sent by President Franklin Pierce to serve as the first U.S. Consul General to Japan, following the treaty written by Commodore Matthew Perry",bert,017600a7962bb406c5bb70db26db2a3b,What is the last name of the person who comes ashore in Shimoda prefecture with his translator?,Harris,Perry,bert,6f2fc60ef93a20a1421790f0253f1d55,What is the last name of the person who comes ashore in Shimoda prefecture with his translator?,Harris,"Perry two years before.

"In 1886, reporter Phineas Mitchell is fired from The Star newspaper for criticizing its methods and philosophy. When his friends stand up for him, they too are discharged. As the newly unemployed men are drowning their sorrows in a bar, Steve Brodie rushes in, claiming to have survived a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and insisting that Mitchell write an article about it and make him famous. Mitchell tells him he no longer has a newspaper job. Then acquaintance Charles A. Leach tells Mitchell that he had always dreamed of going into journalism. Leach makes a startling proposition: that they become partners and launch a new newspaper. Leach has a printing press, vacant offices and enough money to get started.

"In 1905 a scandal erupted in French musical circles over the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome. Fauré's pupil Ravel had been eliminated prematurely in his sixth attempt for this award, and many believed that reactionary elements within the Conservatoire had played a part in it. Dubois, who became the subject of much censure, brought forward his retirement and stepped down at once. Appointed in his place, and with the support of the French government, Fauré radically changed the administration and curriculum. He appointed independent external judges to decide on admissions, examinations and competitions, a move which enraged faculty members who had given preferential treatment to their private pupils; feeling themselves deprived of a considerable extra income, many of them resigned. Fauré was dubbed ""Robespierre"" by disaffected members of the old guard as he modernised and broadened the range of music taught at the Conservatoire. As Nectoux puts it, ""where Auber, Halévy and especially Meyerbeer had reigned supreme ... it was now possible to sing an aria by Rameau or even some Wagner – up to now a forbidden name within the Conservatoire's walls"". The curriculum was broadened to range from Renaissance polyphony to the works of Debussy.Fauré's new position left him better off financially. However, while he also became much more widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling to earn a living as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).",16b91a62f0c4e9dcb88603c1758cf174,What is the name of the person that allowed Wagner to be taught at the Conservatoire?,Fauré,Debussy.Fauré's,bert,d89c2d37d275f5111176ba6d1d1db1e8,What is the name of the person that allowed Wagner to be taught at the Conservatoire?,Fauré,"Dubois,",bert,9ea978e1bfe4272fe0c3ecb42f060749,What is the name of the person that allowed Wagner to be taught at the Conservatoire?,Fauré,Fauré's,bert,db6a9b41b8d05eb3c7d3cc18f8981a12,What is the name of the person that allowed Wagner to be taught at the Conservatoire?,Fauré,Nectoux,bert,9c431cb22d82929e7d5ff483354b6761,What is the name of the person that no longer had time to work on his compositions after his new position?,Fauré,Debussy.Fauré's,bert,7d66eb4d2ed2a389720a2a7aaca31413,What is the name of the person that no longer had time to work on his compositions after his new position?,Fauré,Fauré's,bert,ad3a757e98825fe540495632d98f0961,What is the name of the person that no longer had time to work on his compositions after his new position?,Fauré,Fauré's pupil Ravel,bert,e1e6e2dcb48e5149aff14fc0f76217d4,What is the name of the person that no longer had time to work on his compositions after his new position?,Fauré,Ravel,bert,56aba61c01ad1ec7e5180374132a5d70,What is the name of the person that spent the summer months by one of the Swiss lakes?,Fauré,Debussy.Fauré's,bert,1aa4c8ef508bdb412608c25aca623866,What is the name of the person that spent the summer months by one of the Swiss lakes?,Fauré,Fauré's,bert,41774761e41621db1a33ac2e4e185e15,What is the name of the person that spent the summer months by one of the Swiss lakes?,Fauré,Fauré's pupil Ravel,bert,5667894de38ea461fecd5ffbc04f0e38,What is the name of the person that spent the summer months by one of the Swiss lakes?,Fauré,Ravel,bert,8921d949e6e94b6e53574701b18c47ba,What is the name of the person that would leave Paris in the last days of July?,Fauré,Debussy.Fauré's,bert,4d30da510daf70e52876903b4cc41963,What is the name of the person that would leave Paris in the last days of July?,Fauré,Fauré's,bert,03ffbff07277e8e464b0b88e60fb4c57,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"In 1924, Rix Nicholas, again travelling with Dorothy Richmond, set sail for France, intending to exhibit her works in Europe. She voyaged on the Ormonde, which was also carrying the Australian Olympic team. She befriended several of the team members and painted a portrait of one for an Olympic artists' competition.Arriving in Paris in June, eventually Rix Nicholas rented a studio in Montparnasse, which had previously belonged to French artist Rosa Bonheur. An exhibition at the ""prestigious"" Georges Petit Galerie in Paris in January 1925 was a great success. It led to important sales, including to the Musée du Luxembourg, making her the only Australian woman to have more than one work in its collection and, according to one report, one of only three Australian artists represented at all at that time, the others being Rupert Bunny and Arthur Streeton. The exhibition led also to a tour of her works to London and British regional galleries, the first time any Australian artist had archived such prominence; between 1926 and 1928, her works were shown in Hull, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, Bootle, Blackpool, Northampton, Warrington, Folkestone, Leicester, Derby, Gateshead and Leek in Staffordshire.The work purchased by the Luxembourg in 1925 was In Australia, a portrait of Ned Wright, manager of the property at Delegate where she had stayed in the early 1920s. He is portrayed on horseback, a pipe clasped in his exposed and bright teeth, with a panoramic backdrop of an Australian pastoral landscape.

"In 1933, Freya Roth is a young German girl engaged to a Nazi party member. When she realizes the true nature of his political views she breaks the engagement and turns her attention to anti-Nazi Martin Breitner. Her father, Professor Roth, does not abide by the attitude of the new order towards scientific fact. Though his stepsons Erich and Otto eagerly embrace the regime, Professor Roth's reluctance to conform leads at first to a boycott of his classes and eventually to his arrest and a sentence of forced physical labor.

"In 1939, Martin Kamen and Samuel Ruben of the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley began experiments to determine if any of the elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half-lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research. They synthesized 14C using the laboratory's cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that the atom's half-life was far longer than had been previously thought.  This was followed by a prediction by Serge A. Korff, then employed at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, that the interaction of thermal neutrons with 14N in the upper atmosphere would create 14C. It had previously been thought that 14C would be more likely to be created by deuterons interacting with 13C. At some time during World War II, Willard Libby, who was then at Berkeley, learned of Korff's research and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating.In 1945, Libby moved to the University of Chicago where he began his work on radiocarbon dating. He published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include 14C as well as non-radioactive carbon. Libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with methane collected from sewage works in Baltimore, and after isotopically enriching their samples they were able to demonstrate that they contained 14C. By contrast, methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age. The results were summarized in a paper in Science in 1947, in which the authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin.Libby and James Arnold proceeded to test the radiocarbon dating theory by analyzing samples with known ages. For example, two samples taken from the tombs of two Egyptian kings, Zoser and Sneferu, independently dated to 2625 BC plus or minus 75 years, were dated by radiocarbon measurement to an average of 2800 BC plus or minus 250 years. These results were published in Science in 1949.  Within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide. In 1960, Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.",c5163fcff7eb3f3faec0c74c21478dcc,"What are the last names of the people who, within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide?",Libby,Kamen,bert,aa23271c0400b82911acb14392e87f07,"What are the last names of the people who, within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide?",Libby,Korff's,bert,783f6c9fc0cf03304fae8ed407974a53,"What are the last names of the people who, within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide?",Libby,"Korff,",bert,b3854f905ef8fcc713e2e0c7bde9fc15,"What are the last names of the people who, within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide?",Libby,Zoser,bert,0fb5e000f09dcedb3902e15a511d8339,"What are the last names of the people who, within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide?",Libby,origin.Libby,bert,d979da4fc92cb16ae921f28bc0bb2f6f,What is the full name of the person whose research Libby learned of and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating?,Serge A.

"In 1955, Paul Hindemith revised the work to achieve more clarity. According to Wolfgang Rathert, Hindemith ""sought to moderate Reger's 'uncontrolled invention'"", while Kirshnit described Reger's original scoring as ""gloriously polychromatic"". Hindemith ""thinned"" the orchestra, especially the horns. In Reger's scoring, the organ reinforced the voices throughout the piece, resulting in a lack of clarity for the polyphonic passages. Hindemith used the organ only for climaxes. In the double fugue, he assigned one theme to a voice, but the other simultaneous theme to the orchestra. Hindemith's approach, which enables more analytical listening, seems justified by Reger's own scoring of later compositions which were more refined and focused. It is probably due to his version that Der 100. Psalm enjoyed continuous presence in concert halls, while other works by Reger were neglected.François Callebout wrote an organ version that was published in 2004 by Dr. J. Butz. Gabriel Dessauer explains in the preface that Reger's work was conceived for oratorio choirs of up to 500 singers at the beginning of the 20th century. The organ version enables smaller choirs to perform the music. This version was premiered in 2003 by the Reger-Chor in St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden, the parish to which the composer belonged during his studies in Wiesbaden.

"In 1955, Paul Hindemith revised the work to achieve more clarity. According to Wolfgang Rathert, Hindemith ""sought to moderate Reger's 'uncontrolled invention'"", while Kirshnit described Reger's original scoring as ""gloriously polychromatic"". Hindemith ""thinned"" the orchestra, especially the horns. In Reger's scoring, the organ reinforced the voices throughout the piece, resulting in a lack of clarity for the polyphonic passages. Hindemith used the organ only for climaxes. In the double fugue, he assigned one theme to a voice, but the other simultaneous theme to the orchestra. Hindemith's approach, which enables more analytical listening, seems justified by Reger's own scoring of later compositions which were more refined and focused. It is probably due to his version that Der 100. Psalm enjoyed continuous presence in concert halls, while other works by Reger were neglected.François Callebout wrote an organ version that was published in 2004 by Dr. J. Butz. Gabriel Dessauer explains in the preface that Reger's work was conceived for oratorio choirs of up to 500 singers at the beginning of the 20th century. The organ version enables smaller choirs to perform the music. This version was premiered in 2003 by the Reger-Chor in St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden, the parish to which the composer belonged during his studies in Wiesbaden. The organ was played by Ignace Michiels, organist at the St. Salvator Cathedral in Bruges.Hanns-Friedrich Kaiser, KMD (director of church music) in Weiden, where Reger grew up, wrote a version for choir and organ, which he conducted at the opening of the festival Reger-Tage at the church St. Michael on 16 September 2012, with organist Michael Schöch.",d2b4b4bda4013f66329bde72ec38b92c,What is the last name of the person who played the organ at the 2003 premiere of the rewritten composition?,Michiels,Reger,bert,7620306f8c2148a765a08c33e466790e,"What position was held by the person who in 2012 performed a version of the score that was described as ""gloriously polychromatic""?",KMD,"(director of church music) in Weiden, where Reger grew up, wrote a version for choir",bert,fd8bcf09ee805b83d89d4f5e7518ad62,"What position was held by the person who in 2012 performed a version of the score that was described as ""gloriously polychromatic""?",KMD,"(director of church music) in Weiden, where Reger grew up, wrote a version for choir and organ,",bert,863efef5d7a5782843ee558ef902b428,"What position was held by the person who in 2012 performed a version of the score that was described as ""gloriously polychromatic""?",KMD,"KMD (director of church music) in Weiden, where Reger grew up, wrote a version for choir",bert,2c1c795aee8354577570801a66471061,"What position was held by the person who in 2012 performed a version of the score that was described as ""gloriously polychromatic""?",KMD,"KMD (director of church music) in Weiden, where Reger grew up, wrote a version for choir and organ,",bert,d03db82bf961966ebd5abe27ded3ec45,"What position was held by the person who in 2012 performed a version of the score that was described as ""gloriously polychromatic""?",KMD,choir and organ,bert,32feaa1d73ffe413d2a7ff55397fd1c0,"What was the first name of the person who ""thinned"" the orchestra?",Paul,Paul Hindemith,bert,9ec19e9dcdeb0d65b1f6a0c4df9b0f91,"What was the first name of the person who ""thinned"" the orchestra?",Paul,Paul Hindemith revised the work to achieve more clarity.

"In 1987, James Brennan plans to have a summer vacation in Europe after graduating with a comparative literature degree from Oberlin College and to attend a journalism graduate school at Columbia University when his holidays end. A few days after his graduation, his parents advise him to seek a part-time job rather than going to Europe when they unexpectedly announce that financial problems have taken a toll on them and they would be unable to financially support him. James gets a job at Adventureland, a local amusement park in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his childhood friend Tommy Frigo works. Assistant manager Bobby assigns James to the games area.

"In 2001, President George W. Bush discussed  an accord with Mexican President Vincente Fox. Possible accord was derailed by the September 11 attacks. From 2005 to 2013, the US Congress discussed various ways of controlling immigration. The Senate and House were unable to reach an agreement.Nearly 14 million immigrants entered the United States from 2000 to 2010, and over one million persons were naturalized as U.S. citizens in 2008. The per-country limit applies the same maximum on the number of visas to all countries regardless of their population and has therefore had the effect of significantly restricting immigration of persons born in populous nations such as Mexico, China, India, and the Philippines—the leading countries of origin for legally admitted immigrants to the United States in 2013; nevertheless, China, India, and Mexico were the leading countries of origin for immigrants overall to the United States in 2013, regardless of legal status, according to a U.S. Census Bureau study. As of 2009, 66% of legal immigrants were admitted on the basis of family ties, along with 13% admitted for their employment skills and 17% for humanitarian reasons.Nearly 8 million people immigrated to the United States from 2000 to 2005; 3.7 million of them entered without papers.  In 1986 president Ronald Reagan signed immigration reform that gave amnesty to 3 million undocumented immigrants in the country. Hispanic immigrants suffered job losses during the late-2000s recession, but since the recession's end in June 2009, immigrants posted a net gain of 656,000 jobs. Over 1 million immigrants were granted legal residence in 2011.For those who enter the US illegally across the Mexico–United States border and elsewhere, migration is difficult, expensive and dangerous. Virtually all undocumented immigrants have no avenues for legal entry to the United States due to the restrictive legal limits on green cards, and lack of immigrant visas for low-skilled workers. Participants in debates on immigration in the early twenty-first century called for increasing enforcement of existing laws governing illegal immigration to the United States, building a barrier along some or all of the 2,000-mile (3,200 km) Mexico-U.S. border, or creating a new guest worker program. Through much of 2006 the country and Congress was immersed in a debate about these proposals. As of April 2010 few of these proposals had become law, though a partial border fence had been approved and subsequently canceled.",286c6143732ad41a8991dfc9b6e15848,What two countries had a possible accord that was derailed by the September 11 attacks?,Mexico,Mexican,bert,8321bb7dfca0b715c944fab1224a43d7,What two countries had a possible accord that was derailed by the September 11 attacks?,Mexico,"Mexico, China,",bert,b2702a48bd076bf0ba78d7d4e6283be0,What two countries had a possible accord that was derailed by the September 11 attacks?,Mexico,United States,bert,47d6960efed02671d36895340ba0181f,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

The siblings wrestle, urged on by their parents Rick and Julia. Rick books the children for their first wrestling match where Saraya, initially reluctant to wrestle a boy, goes on to win as planned. At 18, competing under the ring name ""Britani Knight"", Saraya and her brother ""Zak Zodiac"" help their parents train prospective wrestlers while working toward their own promotion.

"In 2012, American songwriter and record producer Benny Blanco met with Norwegian production duo StarGate at a recording studio in New York City to write new songs, including one for Rihanna. StarGate had previously produced her singles ""Don't Stop the Music"" (2007) and ""Only Girl (In the World)"" (2010). According to Blanco, he and StarGate wanted to deviate from Rihanna's usual sound and produce as though the song would be for a rapper such as Kanye West: ""It's the one that we weren't thinking Rihanna ... that turned into the Rihanna record ... But that's how it always happens like with me"". They produced the song's drum machine beat after the other instrumental music was recorded.StarGate's Mikkel Eriksen told The New York Times that Blanco took a recorded snippet of Eriksen's singing, altered it electronically, and made it sound ""dirtier"". He then applied timbre and used audio software to create ghostly accompaniment lines. Eriksen described Blanco's style as ""unorthodox, as he almost never plays the keyboards but throws in weird samples and alters them to the right pitch to go with the song."" Australian singer-songwriter Sia later joined them and wrote the lyrics for ""Diamonds"" in 14 minutes.After the song was completed, they wanted to play it to Rihanna, but Blanco was skeptical about the reaction towards the song because of its slow sound. After StarGate played it to her, they called Blanco from London and told him that she liked the song: ""She's flippin' out. She played it like seven times in a row. It's her favorite song."" Phil Tan and the assistant Daniela Rivera, mixed and mastered ""Diamonds"". Recalling it, in an interview with The Huffington Post, Blanco commented, ""we needed to have it recorded, the beat finished, mixed and mastered in 24 hours. She was recording in a separate part of the world, sending back the files, we're finishing the music and then we're mixing and mastering it, and then it was out in a few days.

"In Britain, a virus has swept the country, turning people into zombies, that are also able to fight back. A squadron of 8 commandos goes in, made up of Perez, Paige, Rodrigo and several others, but disaster soon strikes, when the biggest guy on the team, Jacob, is bitten during a struggle. Jacob commits suicide via gunshot, after Perez made the suggestion to kil him before he turned.  Two stranded but seemingly innocent people on a road, next to a parked car, are then subjected to being shot to death, and this confuses Reeves, who then fights with Perez. Perez notices unseen assailants shoot at Reeves, fatally. Unfortunately, the group has to retreat. Perez is affected by this, and keeps his dog tags. They soon find a little girl, who is supposedly immune. After securing their target from a field, and leaving other survivors behind, they find out the man they picked up is a scientist claiming to know of a cure, but he is not very co-operative. He is severely beaten.  Paige admits to Rodrido (her boyfriend) that she became infected. He shares a passionate kiss with her anyway, knowing he will be infected like her. They stay behind.

"In Chandler, Arizona, FBI agents Kate Macer and Reggie Wayne lead a raid on a suspected Mexican cartel safehouse, where they discover dozens of hidden decaying corpses and a booby trap that kills two policemen. Following the raid, Kate's boss recommends her for a Department of Justice special joint task force, overseen by Matt Graver and the secretive Alejandro Gillick, to apprehend the Sonora Cartel lieutenant Manuel Díaz. Assured that the task force will bring Díaz and those responsible for the safehouse incident to justice, Kate enlists in the operation.  The team travels in force to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, to extradite Díaz's brother and henchman Guillermo Díaz. To preempt an ambush, the team kills several Mexican cartel gunmen at the public border checkpoint, shocking Kate. Alejandro tortures Guillermo and learns that the cartel uses a tunnel to smuggle drugs into the U.S. Reggie and Kate begin to question the task force's illegal and seemingly inexplicable methods. Finally, Matt reveals that the objective is not to apprehend Díaz, as originally suggested, but to disrupt his drug operations to such a degree that Díaz will be summoned back to Mexico by his boss, the elusive Sonora Cartel drug lord Fausto Alarcón.

Their hopes, however, are dashed when Jam's religiously conservative mother discovers the concert tickets and burns them before having Jam transferred to a Catholic boarding school. Trip manages to win tickets and backstage passes from a radio contest in Detroit and the boys plan to rescue Jam from the boarding school. Disguised as pizza delivery boys, they get Father Phillip McNulty drugged from a pizza topped with hallucinogen mushrooms and set off with Jam for Detroit in Lex's mother's Volvo to pick up the tickets.

"In February 1954 Gao Gang, the head of the State Planning Council, was purged from government; he killed himself only months later.  His presence in the painting immediately on Mao's left placed arts officials in a quandary.  Given its popularity among officials and the people, The Founding of the Nation had to be shown at the Second National Arts Exhibition (1955), but it was unthinkable that Gao, deemed a traitor, should be depicted.  Accordingly Dong was ordered to remove Gao from the painting, which he did. Wu Hung described The Founding of the Nation as ""arguably the most celebrated work of official Chinese art"".  He noted that the painting is the only ""canonized"" one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze.  The painting is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae, the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person.  Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting ""the most significant historical image of China's founding"".  Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel the changes that have come to China's leadership during the years of Communist governance.  Andrews wrote that ""its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting"".  Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it ""a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles"".  The painting has never been as highly regarded in the West as in China; according to Andrews, ""art history students have been known to roar with laughter when slides of it appear on the screen"".  Art historian Michael Sullivan dismissed it as mere propaganda.  Today, following a merger of museums, both paintings are in the National Museum of China, on Tiananmen Square.",6fe9c6df145ca093b1f5971eae7c1ead,"What is the full name of the painting referred to as ""the most significant historical image of China's founding""?",The Founding of the Nation,"Deng Zhangyu,",bert,1d769785f400b966de72635ffe42e3bf,"What is the full name of the painting referred to as ""the most significant historical image of China's founding""?",The Founding of the Nation,Second National Arts Exhibition,bert,df5171393d8ee924084a5c547c84215d,"What is the full name of the painting referred to as ""the most significant historical image of China's founding""?",The Founding of the Nation,The Founding of the Nation had to be shown at the Second National Arts Exhibition,bert,1121b7cced0c5c77bbd965b717f454e6,What is the full name of the painting that is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae?,The Founding of the Nation,Second National Arts Exhibition,bert,92797cb52a7354a707a94c83c88abddf,What is the full name of the painting that is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae?,The Founding of the Nation,The Founding,bert,90bea0fc3e222664cb8b07e499a39092,What is the full name of the painting that is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae?,The Founding of the Nation,The Founding of the Nation had to be shown at the Second National Arts Exhibition,bert,9f99f29567dc98eeedb4bd70c034e797,What is the full name of the painting that is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae?,The Founding of the Nation,Wu Hung described The Founding of the Nation,bert,24064a7a612af15ad762d884eff21522,What is the full name of the painting whose alterations over the years parallel the changes that have come to China's leadership during the years of Communist government?,The Founding of the Nation,Founding,bert,3f3a1a483c7f1c40df03572d84130c29,What is the name of that which Michael Sullivan dismissed as mere propaganda?,The Founding of the Nation,Founding of the Nation had to be shown at the Second National Arts Exhibition,bert,78991c689fb907a678c0c4bbcd7870af,What is the name of that which Michael Sullivan dismissed as mere propaganda?,The Founding of the Nation,Second National Arts Exhibition,bert,a2644e5652e4a969a8389ebcce1ec652,What is the name of that which Michael Sullivan dismissed as mere propaganda?,The Founding of the Nation,The painting,bert,72fe78fc700062bfbc52a4b275dd4ed8,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"In Hollywood, director Fred Amiel, movie star Georgia Lorrison, and screenwriter James Lee Bartlow each refuse to speak by phone to Jonathan Shields in Paris. Movie producer Harry Pebbel gathers them in his office and explains that Shields was calling them because he has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project.  Shields cannot get financing on his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem.  Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer. As they await Shields' call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields.  The backstory of their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire ""extras"" to attend his funeral.  Despite the industry's ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood by any means necessary. Shields partners with aspiring director Amiel, whom he meets at his father's funeral. Shields intentionally loses money he does not have in a poker game to film executive Pebbel, so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a line producer. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making B movies for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a $1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to be chosen as director.  The film's success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel comes to work for him there.  Amiel, now independent of Shields, goes on to become an Oscar-winning director in his own right.",2473caba5144de21d881102440d58eeb,What are the full names the people Harry Pebbel gathers in his office?,Fred Amiel,"Fred Amiel, movie star Georgia Lorrison,",bert,1cab380b24651a2352f1e0aa399318c5,What are the full names the people Harry Pebbel gathers in his office?,Fred Amiel,"Georgia Lorrison,",bert,f12bcf7daeb0bc85563d2d49a98dd71d,What are the full names the people Harry Pebbel gathers in his office?,Fred Amiel,James Lee Bartlow,bert,0cded6a15d3986c100cf9b962a07f25e,What are the full names the people Harry Pebbel gathers in his office?,Fred Amiel,"director Fred Amiel,",bert,55b3085af643dbb49360291da69aa499,What are the full names the people Harry Pebbel gathers in his office?,Fred Amiel,"director Fred Amiel, movie star Georgia Lorrison,",bert,35132654725ce0102304da91b26e8d48,What is the last name of the person who becomes a Oscar-winning director in his own right?,Amiel,Shields,bert,53f901b1e8d1900ee909d930d157498a,What is the last name of the person who becomes a Oscar-winning director in his own right?,Amiel,Shields in Paris.

"In Jerusalem, a rabbi named Rostenburg is using software he designed to decode seventy eschatological prophecies hidden within the Torah. Rostenburg has handwritten each one in a journal, to be entered into the program for deciphering. The program deciphers a prophecy which says that he is about to die; immediately, he tears the page containing the final code from his journal, hiding it in his shirt pocket. He is then shot and killed by an assassin, who takes his journal and the optical disc containing the decoding program. After the assassin leaves, two mysterious men (later revealed to be two prophets) retrieve the journal page Rostenburg had hidden. Television reporter and talk show host Cassandra Barris introduces Dr. Gillen Lane as her show's guest. Lane is a popular author and charismatic motivational speaker who explains that codes hidden in the Old Testament describe events past, present, and future; he sees no contradiction between this belief and his dismissal of religious faith. Media mogul and European Union Chairman Stone Alexander receives a humanitarian award in Rome for having all but eliminated world hunger through advances in nutritional technology. There, we see that the man who killed Rostenburg and stole his decoding software is Alexander's apprentice, Dominic. Dr. Lane is in attendance, seeking to meet with Alexander ""to discuss some ideas."" Cassandra, employed by one of Alexander's television networks, is also in attendance, providing Lane brief conversation after Alexander spurns him. Some time afterward, however, Alexander sees a prophecy (deciphered with Rostenberg's program) that leads him to ask Lane to become his Minister of Information.",11e4c72697189495c2b8214817bcfb60,What has Rostenburg handwritten each one of in a journal?,seventy eschatological prophecies,a prophecy,bert,f787f9d425f70a58e88ba507212a56ed,What has Rostenburg handwritten each one of in a journal?,seventy eschatological prophecies,"a prophecy which says that he is about to die; immediately, he tears the page containing the final code",bert,08021fa1e229d6b8caffe3ee1e40926a,What has Rostenburg handwritten each one of in a journal?,seventy eschatological prophecies,final code,bert,e0e90dd28cc3ab198a4aaf95444cf24e,What has Rostenburg handwritten each one of in a journal?,seventy eschatological prophecies,seventy eschatological prophecies hidden within the Torah.,bert,660e29b9f10a190e77067ff7f4341d00,What is the full name of the person that owns the television station that Cassandra Barris' talk show is on?,Stone Alexander,Chairman Stone Alexander,bert,e0dcfe225276e3efa5bab029e85f421b,What is the full name of the person that owns the television station that Cassandra Barris' talk show is on?,Stone Alexander,Dominic.,bert,628c13f8923ba0442f60b0680e8d8e5c,What is the full name of the person that owns the television station that Cassandra Barris' talk show is on?,Stone Alexander,Dominic.

"In July 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell hosts a house party where guests watch Neil Armstrong's televised first human steps on the Moon. Afterwards Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on Apollo 8, tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon to walk on its surface. Three months later, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's Vertical Assembly Building, his boss Deke Slayton informs him that because of problems with Alan Shepard's crew, his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their new mission. A few days before launch, Mattingly is exposed to the measles, and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, Jack Swigert. Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband getting killed in space, but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off. On April 11, 1970, Flight Director Gene Kranz gives the go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for the Apollo 13 launch. As the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage fires to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the maneuver to connect the Command/Service Module Odyssey to the Lunar Module Aquarius and pull it away from the spent rocket.",6e6c167ac6ba5dcf7b19bc68f65a92ba,What was the first Apollo rocket that Lovell rode in?,Apollo 8,Apollo 13,bert,d6b5aea3a2276039e4645f697a8d1c4b,What was the first Apollo rocket that Lovell rode in?,Apollo 8,"Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the maneuver to connect the Command/Service Module Odyssey to the Lunar Module Aquarius",bert,b04c59c37ab23571dbacd7b136de614a,What was the first Apollo rocket that Lovell rode in?,Apollo 8,Saturn V,bert,e70e2ca6006b6b40bcde749be91bf48e,What was the first Apollo rocket that Lovell rode in?,Apollo 8,Saturn V rocket,bert,355880d8225e0d4923385508f92d11f9,Which Apollo spacecraft was Lovell initially scheduled to ride?,14,Apollo 13,bert,e267152bfdbc0e88cb6233b71fc88158,Which Apollo spacecraft was Lovell initially scheduled to ride?,14,Apollo 13 launch.

"In March 1943, DuPont began construction of a plutonium plant on a 112-acre (0.5 km2) site at Oak Ridge. Intended as a pilot plant for the larger production facilities at Hanford, it included the air-cooled X-10 Graphite Reactor, a chemical separation plant, and support facilities. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot. The X-10 Graphite Reactor consisted of a huge block of graphite, 24 feet (7.3 m) long on each side, weighing around 1,500 short tons (1,400 t), surrounded by 7 feet (2.1 m) of high-density concrete as a radiation shield.The greatest difficulty was encountered with the uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow had to be coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a hot dipping process without success. Meanwhile, Alcoa tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure rate of more than 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of General Electric, which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.Watched by Fermi and Compton, the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical on 4 November 1943 with about 30 short tons (27 t) of uranium. A week later the load was increased to 36 short tons (33 t), raising its power generation to 500 kW, and by the end of the month the first 500 mg of plutonium was created. Modifications over time raised the power to 4,000 kW in July 1944. X-10 operated as a production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities.",52268013ace4ecf389387a1c3272b518,In what month was the first plutonium created?,November,4 November,bert,aba26d25b6ad0292445ab48e7e94c824,In what month was the first plutonium created?,November,4 November 1943,bert,f6ca590b67c27fd62daecb06ba1bfb93,In what month was the first plutonium created?,November,July,bert,7ad276050a3bb9023708d635b99b327a,In what month was the first plutonium created?,November,July 1944.,bert,7ca679ec93e558a4274e683496ad1afb,In what month was the first plutonium created?,November,"October 1943.Watched by Fermi and Compton, the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical on 4 November",bert,2e5fa9a1ca36d305bcce684e51ec5111,Where was DuPont planning to build a larger plant?,Hanford,(0.5 km2) site at Oak Ridge.,bert,a13deddf70402a2759c416c8b4b057d2,Where was DuPont planning to build a larger plant?,Hanford,Oak Ridge.,bert,845cda5e627b1deba456d5dc69e2043c,Where was DuPont planning to build a larger plant?,Hanford,"Oak Ridge.

"In New York City, high-strung equity trader Joy Ellis McNally is dumped by her fiancé at a surprise birthday party she throws for him. At the same time, easy-going carpenter Jack Fuller is fired from his job by his father, Jack, Sr. Both become emotionally distraught and, with best friends Toni ""Tipper"", a bartender, and Jeff ""Hater"", a lawyer, take a debauched trip to Las Vegas. Joy and Jack meet by chance when they are given the same hotel room because of a computer error. After clearing up the misunderstanding and receiving upgraded rooms and coupons to various clubs, they party and drink together and end up getting married. The next morning, they realize it was a mistake and decide to divorce. Before they do so, Jack uses a quarter Joy gives him in a slot machine. He hits a three million dollar jackpot and Joy reminds Jack that they are married and hence, she is entitled to half of the money. The couple return to New York, where they attempt to divorce. The judge declares that the couple cannot divorce until they attempt to co-exist for six months, while attending weekly sessions with Dr. Twitchell, a marriage counselor. If they work at the marriage but still want to divorce after six months, each will be permitted to keep half the winnings. If either party does not cooperate, the money will be tied up in litigation by the judge. The newlyweds devise more and more cunning schemes to undermine each other, such as Jack telling Joy that their counseling session is canceled to prove she's not committed, and Joy inviting girls to their apartment to try to get Jack to cheat on her, throwing a party where Jack's friend Dave shows up. Jack gives Joy's ex-fiancé, Mason, her engagement ring back without Joy knowing. At Joy's job retreat, Jack and Joy find themselves developing an unexpected attraction to one another, and they soon realize that being with each other has brought out the best in both of them.",61bbb2639e669edafd6f551dc7e364f9,What are the first names of the two people who decide to get a divorce after realizing they made a mistake?,Joy,Jack,bert,95788658bdaf3d0cca9f81caae96d8d1,What are the first names of the two people who decide to get a divorce after realizing they made a mistake?,Joy,"Jack Fuller is fired from his job by his father, Jack, Sr. Both become emotionally distraught and, with best friends Toni",bert,e4cabb982732b4ba256354d3f3c31a2b,What are the first names of the two people who decide to get a divorce after realizing they made a mistake?,Joy,"Joy Ellis McNally is dumped by her fiancé at a surprise birthday party she throws for him.

"In New York City, high-strung equity trader Joy Ellis McNally is dumped by her fiancé at a surprise birthday party she throws for him. At the same time, easy-going carpenter Jack Fuller is fired from his job by his father, Jack, Sr. Both become emotionally distraught and, with best friends Toni ""Tipper"", a bartender, and Jeff ""Hater"", a lawyer, take a debauched trip to Las Vegas. Joy and Jack meet by chance when they are given the same hotel room because of a computer error. After clearing up the misunderstanding and receiving upgraded rooms and coupons to various clubs, they party and drink together and end up getting married. The next morning, they realize it was a mistake and decide to divorce. Before they do so, Jack uses a quarter Joy gives him in a slot machine. He hits a three million dollar jackpot and Joy reminds Jack that they are married and hence, she is entitled to half of the money. The couple return to New York, where they attempt to divorce. The judge declares that the couple cannot divorce until they attempt to co-exist for six months, while attending weekly sessions with Dr. Twitchell, a marriage counselor. If they work at the marriage but still want to divorce after six months, each will be permitted to keep half the winnings. If either party does not cooperate, the money will be tied up in litigation by the judge. The newlyweds devise more and more cunning schemes to undermine each other, such as Jack telling Joy that their counseling session is canceled to prove she's not committed, and Joy inviting girls to their apartment to try to get Jack to cheat on her, throwing a party where Jack's friend Dave shows up. Jack gives Joy's ex-fiancé, Mason, her engagement ring back without Joy knowing. At Joy's job retreat, Jack and Joy find themselves developing an unexpected attraction to one another, and they soon realize that being with each other has brought out the best in both of them.",18a4a5fe56581b32f6ee6812a6513767,What did the carpenter give to Mason?,engagement ring,a slot machine,bert,79fd50835561095f55d061b8ace9c0e3,What did the carpenter give to Mason?,engagement ring,engagement ring back,bert,db7f223517ee5bc63a7e3f003587da9b,What did the carpenter give to Mason?,engagement ring,her engagement ring,bert,825b7b462bc8b6d6a4d704a944e5e774,What did the carpenter give to Mason?,engagement ring,her engagement ring back,bert,e79522c6676b9fbadd0775bbea9780bc,What did the carpenter give to Mason?,engagement ring,ring,bert,aa521c3c52c7a1b449fde27633e3a508,What is the name of the equity trader's ex-fiancé?,Mason,"Dave shows up.

"In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At the time he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being separated from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though he was not the target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.Britten was at the RCM from 1930 to 1933, studying composition with Ireland and piano with Arthur Benjamin. He won the Sullivan Prize for composition, the Cobbett Prize for chamber music, and was twice winner of the Ernest Farrar Prize for composition. Despite these honours, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students ""amateurish and folksy"" and the staff ""inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere"". Another Ireland pupil, the composer Humphrey Searle, said that Ireland could be ""an inspiring teacher to those on his own wavelength""; Britten was not, and learned little from him. He continued to study privately with Bridge, although he later praised Ireland for ""nurs[ing] me very gently through a very, very difficult musical adolescence"".Britten also used his time in London to attend concerts and become better acquainted with the music of Stravinsky, Shostakovich and, most particularly, Mahler. He intended postgraduate study in Vienna with Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg's student, but was eventually dissuaded by his parents, on the advice of the RCM staff.The first of Britten's compositions to attract wide attention were composed while at the RCM: the Sinfonietta, Op. 1 (1932), the oboe quartet Phantasy, Op. 2, dedicated to Léon Goossens  who played the first performance in a BBC broadcast on 6 August 1933, and a set of choral variations A Boy was Born, written in 1933 for the BBC Singers, who first performed it the following year. In this same period he wrote Friday Afternoons, a collection of 12 songs for the pupils of Clive House School, Prestatyn, where his brother was headmaster.",9a086db9999a2ec55d42c577f15873e9,Where was Britten unhappy?,Gresham's School,Gresham's,bert,a68c9a0c22719504018cf6a184e6d51b,Where was Britten unhappy?,Gresham's School,"Holt, Norfolk.",bert,08870138308602010e987dc06d9afd3c,Where was Britten unhappy?,Gresham's School,"in Holt, Norfolk.",bert,9333f283b4f403919bcbab683a6b188b,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"In Sydney, Australia, a puppy named Muffin is living with a human family and his own mother. Muffin, calling himself Napoleon and pretending to be tough, wishes that he could live with the wild dogs that he can hear howling in the distance. The family has a birthday party and one of the decorations is a basket with balloons strapped to it. Out of curiosity, Napoleon hops inside, but the basket, untied from its tether, begins to float away. Napoleon flies high above the city and heads out to the sea. A galah named Birdo drops down on the side of his basket and offers to help him get down. Birdo's idea of help is to pop the balloons suspending the basket, causing Napoleon to land unharmed on a beachhead. Napoleon thinks he can finally seek out the wild dogs and heads into a nearby forest, ignoring Birdo's suggestion to return home. At night, Napoleon starts to fear being alone. A mopoke in the forest warns Napoleon of terrible things that can happen to pets in the wild, but Napoleon ignores him as well and continues on his way. He discovers a large tree used by a psychotic cat as a home. The cat spots Napoleon and, thinking he is a mouse, chases him. Napoleon escapes when the mopoke pushes the cat into a pond. The mopoke then warns Napoleon that the cat will not rest until he is dead. As Napoleon runs off, the cat pulls herself from the pond angrily swearing revenge. The next morning, Napoleon once again encounters Birdo, who decides to teach Napoleon how to live in the wild.",d855257e65670f1f5b60152189c1d0ec,What animal chases the dog because it thinks he's a mouse?,cat,A mopoke,bert,67537073e151e63d729fff0338074c61,What animal chases the dog because it thinks he's a mouse?,cat,"The cat spots Napoleon and, thinking he is a mouse, chases him.

"In a positive review of the song, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave it four out of five stars and praised Rihanna's direction towards a ""softer and more prolific edge"". Brittany Lewis of GlobalGrind called ""Diamonds"" a catchy song and felt that it had the potential to be another hit for Rihanna. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that, although it does not sound like an emphatic hit, the lyrical content of the song depicts a ""personal shift"" for Rihanna. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, ""Diamonds"" is more positive than previous singles such as ""We Found Love"" and ""Where Have You Been"", despite its moderate tempo. Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's singing is stronger than ever. Contactmusic's reviewer described it as a ""laid-back track"", and suggested that the lyrical content is related to her former boyfriend Chris Brown. In a track-by-track review of Unapologetic, Andrew Hampp of Billboard found the song inspiring and commented that it ""finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date"". Andy Kellman of Allmusic cited the song as one of the highlights on Unapologetic, and gave it three and a half stars.In a less enthusiastic critique, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times likened ""Diamonds"" to a James Bond movie theme song, but with ""insipid lyrics"". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News felt that the song is not as evocative as it attempts to be and lacks the sense of mystery and engaging production found on ""We Found Love"". Kevin Blair of the Irish Independent's, Independent Woman, was critical of the song for deviating from Rihanna's previous dance and R&B songs and dismissed it as a ""chugging, faintly misty-eyed, middle of the road pop song"". Chris Richards of The Washington Post panned the song as a ""power ballad without much power"".",9f0e503d1d6b015619f8b25492591b82,"What is the name of the person that had a hit song called ""Diamonds""?",Rihanna,Rihanna's,bert,57e8025e80d934e3e396fa51cb3a82cf,What is the name of the person whose former boyfriend is suggested by Contactmusic's reviewer to be related to the lyrical content of Diamonds?,Rihanna,Lindsey DiMattina,bert,fb3b791a1bf2f36e1df53f3622bc79ec,What is the name of the person whose former boyfriend is suggested by Contactmusic's reviewer to be related to the lyrical content of Diamonds?,Rihanna,Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's,bert,bb72fac726083b45c4e27e9763bf49c4,What is the name of the person whose former boyfriend is suggested by Contactmusic's reviewer to be related to the lyrical content of Diamonds?,Rihanna,Rihanna's,bert,a51a081aeecae709d72f62ab37af3d8e,"What is the name of the song found to be inspiring by Andrew Hampp, who commented that it ""finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date""?",Diamonds,"""Diamonds"" is more positive than previous singles such as ""We Found Love""",bert,8220fac19e60a5d211dfeef6412552a1,"What is the name of the song found to be inspiring by Andrew Hampp, who commented that it ""finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date""?",Diamonds,"""We Found Love""",bert,05654e5da7bef7a9092483c4c3536a2b,"What is the name of the song found to be inspiring by Andrew Hampp, who commented that it ""finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date""?",Diamonds,"Unapologetic,",bert,3f95a0ca983b2bc6090f5c296a2978ba,What is the name of the song that Andrew Hampp found the song inspiring?,"""Diamonds""","""We",bert,bbdb71c5c2b5518107d0aa238065e90a,What is the name of the song that Andrew Hampp found the song inspiring?,"""Diamonds""","""We Found Love"".",bert,817e564d5860d7dff739c8eff48522ee,What is the name of the song that Andrew Hampp found the song inspiring?,"""Diamonds""","Love"".",bert,98cc7da01a411c47399d8a28af6366c3,What is the name of the song that Andrew Hampp found the song inspiring?,"""Diamonds""","Unapologetic,",bert,751eedd1fcafacfeb9309490fd2ad0f4,"What is the name of the track described as ""laid-back"" by Contactmusic's reviewer?",Diamonds,"""Diamonds"" is more positive than previous singles such as ""We Found Love""",bert,5afa30b4719ec194a9718c1a837a4036,"What is the name of the track described as ""laid-back"" by Contactmusic's reviewer?",Diamonds,"""We Found Love""",bert,aea563d5e2e0c2e220488acfa397777e,What song did Jim Farber feel had a better production?,"""We Found Love""","""Diamonds""",bert,6c04a2c1780b6e32c82468e2bdcdc898,What song did Jim Farber feel had a better production?,"""We Found Love""","Love"".",bert,4437be45c946d5560b422882eebc68f2,"What was the name of the song that was describes as a ""laid-back track""?","""Diamonds""","""Diamonds"" is more positive than previous singles such as ""We Found Love""",bert,6a86acd4d81693ceda9b652a9ce18688,"What was the name of the song that was describes as a ""laid-back track""?","""Diamonds""","""We Found Love""",bert,7d80564fd84ba0c73a494382ae00187b,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"In a quiet English town, seventeen-year-old Jo Halliday lives a fairly boring life working as a hairdresser and living at home, with her nagging mother, pompous father, and fitness-obsessed Aunt. Her father, an accountant, continually wishes that his dreamy, untidy daughter could be more like his secretary Miss Jones. One morning the local newspaper reveals that Jo has authored a book—The Naked Revolt—which is an instant bestseller. It tells the story of a young girl who discovers the truth about her family and neighbours, and flees to London to become a prostitute. Unfortunately the town's residents believe the book to be a true reflection of the family. Her father finds himself under suspicion at work, as his colleagues believe he has been stealing money, and her mother is regarded as a harlot who has been conducting a twenty-year affair with a retired army officer who gives her driving lessons and is Jo's real father. Her local doctor is painted as a philanderer who is sexually involved with a number of his patients while ignoring the desperate advances of his drunken assistant, Jo's aunt. In fact, these things are all untrue: her father is scrupulously honest and in love with her mother; the local doctor is a shy man, and the former army officer is simply a family friend. Jo has left town for London with a young playwright who is interested in turning her book into a play. After discovering they are kindred spirits, the two become engaged. When they return home Jo is confronted by her angry family and neighbours. The doctor is threatening to sue, and her father and mother have begun questioning each other's fidelity.",c0606216a04ed1d3cc44c641fc707f72,What is the first name of the person whose father finds himself under suspicion at work?,Jo,Jo Halliday,bert,6244ea5f361677eee987a8c8d2c8e951,What is the first name of the person whose father finds himself under suspicion at work?,Jo,Jo has authored a book—The Naked Revolt—which is an instant bestseller.

"In early 2005, Frusciante entered the studio to work on his fifth and final studio album with the Chili Peppers, Stadium Arcadium. His guitar playing is dominant throughout the album, and he provides backing vocals on most of the tracks. Although usually following a ""less is more"" style of guitar playing, he began using a full twenty-four track mixer for maximum effect. In the arrangements, he incorporates a wide array of sounds and playing styles, similar to the funk-influenced Blood Sugar Sex Magik or the more melodic By the Way. He also changed his approach to his playing, opting to contribute solos and allow songs to be formed from jam sessions. In an interview from Guitar World, Frusciante explained how he approached his guitar solos for their album Stadium Arcadium completely differently from those for their previous albums. On Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication, Frusciante had a general idea how he wanted his guitar solos to sound. For Stadium Arcadium, almost every guitar solo was completely improvised by Frusciante on the spot. Several reviews have stressed that the influence of Hendrix is evident in his solos on the album, with Frusciante himself backing this up. He also expanded the use of guitar effects throughout the album, and used various other instruments such as the synthesizer and mellotron. He worked continuously with Rubin over-dubbing guitar progressions, changing harmonies and using all his technical resources.Frusciante began a series of collaborations with friend Omar Rodríguez-López and his band The Mars Volta, by contributing guitar and electronic instrumentation to song ""Cicatriz ESP"" off their album De-Loused in the Comatorium. He also contributed guitar solos on their 2005 album Frances the Mute. In 2006, he helped The Mars Volta complete their third album Amputechture by playing guitar on seven of its eight tracks. In return, Rodriguez-Lopez has played on several of Frusciante's solo albums, as well as making a guest appearance on Stadium Arcadium.",f7f9e767113c91c9d2599e4f721f1352,What album did Frusciante incorporate a wide array of sounds and playing styles similar to the more melodic By the Way?,Stadium Arcadium,Blood Sugar Sex Magik,bert,44ead9a5da225c071091594c9d4f1ab4,What album did Frusciante incorporate a wide array of sounds and playing styles similar to the more melodic By the Way?,Stadium Arcadium,"Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication,",bert,f5a3727736fc087891f9113097730a0d,What album did Frusciante incorporate a wide array of sounds and playing styles similar to the more melodic By the Way?,Stadium Arcadium,De-Loused in the Comatorium.,bert,7f7ac07dd3c68eb075ae281cf0ecef37,What album did Frusciante incorporate a wide array of sounds and playing styles similar to the more melodic By the Way?,Stadium Arcadium,less is more,bert,d69ccac63ff24d5a4be51220931e1c6a,What album did Frusciante incorporate a wide array of sounds and playing styles similar to the more melodic By the Way?,Stadium Arcadium,"maximum effect.

"In late 1996, after more than five years of addiction to heroin, Frusciante quit it cold turkey. However, months later he was still unable to break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol. In January 1998, urged by longtime friend Bob Forrest, Frusciante checked into Las Encinas, a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, to begin his recovery. Upon arrival, he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants. He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms. About a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas and re-entered society.Fully recovered and once again healthy, Frusciante began living a more spiritual, ascetic lifestyle. He changed his diet, becoming more health-conscious and eating mostly unprocessed foods. Through regular practice of vipassana and yoga, he discovered the effect that self-discipline has on the body. To maintain his increased spiritual awareness and reduce distraction from his music, Frusciante decided to abstain from sexual activity stating: ""I'm very well without it."" All of these changes in his life have led him to a complete change in his attitude toward drugs: I don't need to take drugs. I feel so much more high all the time right now because of the type of momentum that a person can get going when you really dedicate yourself to something that you really love. I don't even consider doing them, they're completely silly. Between my dedication to trying to constantly be a better musician and eating my health foods and doing yoga, I feel so much more high than I did for the last few years of doing drugs. At this point I'm the happiest person in the world. These things do not fuck with me at all, and I'm so proud of that—you don't know how proud I am. It's such a beautiful thing to be able to face life, to face yourself, without hiding behind drugs; without having to have anger towards people who love you. There are people who are scared of losing stuff, but you don't lose anything for any other reason than if you just give up on yourself.",8534b6cb24a4830ec3600da2b3c772ce,What is the name of the person that had to get dental implants?,Frusciante,te,bert,4d742a3362d3df46081d5f8e08917be1,What is the name of the person that was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection?,Frusciante,te,bert,1c71825dfbfac99d3a03b913cf294a6b,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"In mid-1920s Copenhagen, portrait artist Gerda Wegener asks her husband, popular landscape artist Einar Wegener, to stand in for a female model who is late to come to their flat to pose for a painting she's working on. The act of posing as a female figure unmasks Einar's life-long identification as a woman, who names herself Lili Elbe. This sets off a progression, first tentative and then irreversible, of leaving behind the identity as Einar, which she has struggled to maintain all her life. This takes place as both Lili and Gerda relocate to Paris; Gerda's portraits of Lili in her feminine state attract serious attention from art dealers in a way that her previous portraiture had not. It is there that Gerda tracks down art dealer Hans Axgil, a childhood friend of Lili (whom Lili had kissed when they were young). Hans and Gerda's mutual attraction is a challenge, as Gerda is navigating her changing relationship to Lili; but Hans' long-time friendship with and affection for Lili cause him to be supportive of both Lili and Gerda. As Lili's continued existence presenting as male becomes too much to bear, she starts to seek help from psychologists, but none yields any result, and, in one instance, almost leads her into being committed to an asylum. Eventually, at Hans's recommendation, Lili and Gerda meet Dr. Kurt Warnekros. Dr. Warnekros explains that he has met several people like her, who are physically male but identify as female, and proposes a new, innovative and controversial solution: male to female sex reassignment surgery. This would entail a two-part procedure that involves first removing Lili's external genitalia and then, after a period of recovery, fashioning a vagina. He warns Lili and Gerda that it is a very dangerous operation that has never been attempted before, and Lili would be one of the first to undergo it. Lili immediately agrees and, soon after, travels to Germany to begin the surgery.",459ec597f346c85f28a3a245afbdacab,What does Dr. Warnekros warn is a dangerous surgery?,male to female sex reassignment surgery,a vagina,bert,9fd50ae7209db241c8ec67a961fdc576,What does Dr. Warnekros warn is a dangerous surgery?,male to female sex reassignment surgery,male,bert,32a864e264bc70cb280a00492fb61bf6,What does Dr. Warnekros warn is a dangerous surgery?,male to female sex reassignment surgery,male to female sex reassignment,bert,23e6fde8da4d1e5c45d385398e45b08a,What does Dr. Warnekros warn is a dangerous surgery?,male to female sex reassignment surgery,male to female sex reassignment surgery.

"In post-World War II Italy, Malvina is on her deathbed at her ancestral home. She tells Jakob, her adolescent son, that another woman will come, a woman who will love him, and that the next words he speaks will call Malvina back to him. Seven months later a British nurse specializing in children's care, Verena, arrives. Jakob hasn't spoken since his mother died and Verena is the latest English-speaking (per Malvina's wishes) nurse recruited by Klaus, Jakob's father. Verena meets estate keeper Alessio and retired house maid Lilia. Though polite, Jakob is cold and distant. Verena learns that Malvina's family owned the estate and surrounding quarries for 1,200 years. Malvina was the first descendant not to run the quarry, instead becoming a world famous pianist. Since most of the men who worked there died during the second world war, she allowed the quarry to flood, though Alessio still lights a flame for long-dead quarrymen, proclaiming ""Life. Death. Love. The stone was everything.""  When Verena looks in on Jakob one night, she finds him with his ear to the stone wall in his room, listening. Klaus fears that Jakob believes he can hear Malvina in the stone. Verena worries that she is inadequate and that Jakob's condition requires a mental health specialist. When Verena sees Jakob on the ledge of a tall tower, she endangers herself to rescue him – making her (and Jakob) realize that she cares for him and must stay to help him.  She caringly explains that the voice he hears is real, but that it is just his mind playing tricks on him. The next day Verena sees him listening to Malvina's tombstone in the family mausoleum. Alessio informs her that 40 generations are buried there ""in the stone"". Verena, who was orphaned around Jakob's age, tells the boy that she already knows that wishing to hear dead loved ones does not make it happen.",d6fc283cbb10bbd27b0f5f5718bc2958,What does Verena say will not happen simply by wishing?,hear dead loved ones,"""Life.

"In seventeenth-century Paris, poet and supreme swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac stops a play from being shown because he ostensibly cannot stand the bombastic style of the principal actor, Montfleury. An annoyed aristocratic fop, the Vicomte de Valvert, provokes him into a duel by tritely insulting Cyrano's enormous nose. Cyrano first mocks his lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert could have phrased it (much to the amusement of the audience). He then composes a ballade for the occasion on the spot and recites it during the sword fight. With the last line, he stabs his opponent. Cyrano's friend Le Bret, Captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies of his victim's friends, but he is unconcerned. When Le Bret presses him to reveal the real reason he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor smiling at his beautiful cousin Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of it being returned because of his nose. When he receives a request from Roxane to see her in the morning, he is finally emboldened to act. Then pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau approaches him for help. Ragueneau has learned that a nobleman he had mocked with his verses, the Comte De Guiche, has hired a hundred ruffians to teach him a lesson. Cyrano escorts him, kills eight of the horde, and drives off the rest. The next day, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette, though she has not even spoken to him. Cyrano hides his devastation and agrees to help her.",7f46101e5a75258882f7dff6ec45958f,What is the full name of the man that the supreme swordsman stabs while singing?,Vicomte de Valvert,Christian,bert,76a65ae675610b907ffe4968ca1272dd,What is the full name of the man that the supreme swordsman stabs while singing?,Vicomte de Valvert,"Christian de Neuvillette,",bert,4f1222908a3f49779580bc2523eee2bc,What is the full name of the man that the supreme swordsman stabs while singing?,Vicomte de Valvert,Cyrano de Bergerac,bert,ad0ed3996b4662666949a125169fc1ba,What is the full name of the man that the supreme swordsman stabs while singing?,Vicomte de Valvert,"Cyrano de Bergerac stops a play from being shown because he ostensibly cannot stand the bombastic style of the principal actor, Montfleury.",bert,7d11e295208f70ac0e3ad27a70f48531,What is the full name of the man that the supreme swordsman stabs while singing?,Vicomte de Valvert,"the Comte De Guiche,",bert,e76f3f3c34c85acf6e9f1f99476516ff,What is the full name of the man that wants to teach a lesson to the fellow poet to the supreme swordsman?,Comte De Guiche,"Christian de Neuvillette,",bert,c21f8712b580c0a5e61aa854b819f9c9,What is the full name of the man that wants to teach a lesson to the fellow poet to the supreme swordsman?,Comte De Guiche,Cyrano de Bergerac,bert,dd2312d9a6fda62f77d22b1f53ee1074,What is the full name of the man that wants to teach a lesson to the fellow poet to the supreme swordsman?,Comte De Guiche,Ragueneau,bert,3e67704df9dac4387e046fd659e7722f,What is the full name of the man that wants to teach a lesson to the fellow poet to the supreme swordsman?,Comte De Guiche,"Ragueneau approaches him for help.

"In the 1960s, in an undetermined place in the Alps, an eagle couple has two hatching eggs. When both eaglets are born, their mother knows that she must only raise one as their successor. In an ensuing fight with another eagle, the eaglets' father dies when he crashes to the ground. One of the eaglets shortly falls from the nest, and his mother, due by nature to maintain the survivor, ignores the eaglet's cry for help. In the meantime, forester Danzer meets with a boy named Lukas and his father Keller. They both live in a new house in the mountains, after the death of Maria, mother of Lukas and Keller's wife, as a result of a fire. Keller, gravely afflicted by the death of his wife, fails to live in harmony and understanding with his son, who takes refuge more and more in nature, avoiding contact with his father. As a retreat Lukas constantly goes to the remains of his old house, where he often sees the photograph of his deceased mother. As Lukas' dog Scout is taking a walk in the forrest, Lukas comes across the eaglet, and Lukas decides to raise him to full health. Lukas takes the eaglet to his old house to take care of him. Danzer also meets the eaglet, and decides to help Lukas for the affection he feels for him. The forester tells Lukas that the food he has given the eaglet is not good. He also tells him to give sunlight to the eaglet. When a fox sneaks in and kills Keller's hens, he angrily chases Lukas. Lukas, fearful for the safety of the eaglet, goes to his family's hut. Lukas rescues the eaglet from the attacking foxes. As Lukas stays and reads his family's Bible, he comes across the story of Cain and Abel. Aptly fitting the eaglet's own story, Lukas names it Abel.",a7ba999ddeb9e29ac317c1776ab2edf3,What is the name of the dog owned by the boy that the father is losing touch with?,Scout,Abel.,bert,33ef110332fe14aa15718f055bf8b625,What is the name of the dog owned by the boy that the father is losing touch with?,Scout,"Scout is taking a walk in the forrest, Lukas comes across the eaglet,",bert,485107c43e93efc408cbb46b58ebee42,What is the name of the dog owned by the boy that the father is losing touch with?,Scout,dog Scout,bert,a957b1407a3575b795f2f160f9bf5cd9,What is the name of the dog owned by the boy that the father is losing touch with?,Scout,"dog Scout is taking a walk in the forrest, Lukas comes across the eaglet,",bert,cd223470047227b91fd3098026ba5131,What is the name of the dog owned by the boy that the father is losing touch with?,Scout,eaglet,bert,bfbd1e8b38933aba23dfe3deef6c2f08,Who helps the boy raise the eaglet?,Danzer,"Danzer also meets the eaglet, and decides to help Lukas for the affection he feels for him.

"In the Puranic texts of Hinduism, Narasimha (""man-lion"") a half-lion, half-man incarnation or avatar of Vishnu, is worshipped by his devotees and saved the child devotee Prahlada from his father, the evil demon king Hiranyakashipu; Vishnu takes the form of half-man, half-lion] creature in Narasimha, where he has a human torso and lower body, and a lion-like face and claws. Singh is an ancient Indian vedic name meaning ""lion"", dating back over 2,000 years in ancient India. It was originally used only by Rajputs, a Hindu Kshatriya or military caste. After the birth of the Khalsa brotherhood in 1699, the Sikhs also adopted the name ""Singh"" due to the wishes of Guru Gobind Singh. Along with millions of Hindu Rajputs today, it is also used by over 20 million Sikhs worldwide.The Asiatic lion is found as an emblem on numerous flags and coats of arms across Asia, including on the National Emblem of India. The Asiatic lion is also symbolic for the Sinhalese, Sri Lanka's ethnic majority; the term derived from the Indo-Aryan Sinhala, meaning the ""lion people"" or ""people with lion blood"", while a sword-wielding lion is the central figure on the national flag of Sri Lanka.",8876a56e5592970972a8d1eb3520b532,"What means ""lion people""?",Sinhalese,Asiatic lion,bert,0a096a85ffaf8e41b6fdf57e26149ae4,"What means ""lion people""?",Sinhalese,"Asiatic lion is also symbolic for the Sinhalese, Sri Lanka's ethnic majority; the term derived from the Indo-Aryan Sinhala,",bert,7601158b361aa7a5485fe1a203049169,"What means ""lion people""?",Sinhalese,"Asiatic lion is found as an emblem on numerous flags and coats of arms across Asia, including on the National Emblem of India.

"In the early Sixties, Corinne Walker is a girl who is skeptical about God. After her brother is stillborn, her parents' marriage disintegrates over the course of several years. As a teenager, she meets Ethan Miller, a budding musician in local rock band The Renegades. The two marry after Corinne gets pregnant and have a daughter, Abigail. While touring with Ethan's band, their bus crashes into a river. Ethan rushes to save Abby, and Corinne pleads with God to save the child. Abby is pulled out of the bus before it sinks into the water, and Ethan believes that God wanted them to live. Ethan and Corinne grow more fond of Jesus, eventually giving themselves over to a radical New Testament church. As adults, Corinne and Ethan live with their children—Abigail and Lilly—amid a community of self-described ""Jesus freaks"". Corinne's daily life consists of hours of Bible study and alternative family practices. The husbands are told by Pastor Bill that they should pay more attention to their wives' sexual needs after a fellow husband's indiscretions caused his wife to leave with their children. Corinne's closest friend Annika also warns her about keeping the marriage alive by trying new things, such as drawing their husbands' penises. One day, Corinne's younger sister, Wendy, shows up on her doorstep after ending yet another bad relationship, and moves in with them. Their father comes over for dinner, and says that children are the most important things in life. He takes responsibility over how losing their baby brother caused him to wreck his marriage. Later, Ethan finds Lilly playing with some cocaine she found in Wendy's suitcase. He and Corinne flush the drugs down the toilet, and Wendy storms off.",ec45cc6fffe244f25906f71132ea13f9,What is Abigail's nickname?,Abby,Corinne Walker,bert,94514095914e8d5c53b0919f40742dd2,What is Abigail's nickname?,Abby,Lilly,bert,e33de8cf55f1d0c7e8d721e51f8f599b,What is Abigail's nickname?,Abby,Lilly—amid,bert,feb59492f6e3eb8d6a4e345fa9027097,What is Abigail's nickname?,Abby,"Wendy,",bert,1ee25d65a247a311a6f04c84c89d920c,What is the first name of the person that is warned about keeping the marriage alive by trying new things?,Corinne,Annika,bert,ada70b9e440ae21e55bfd1fd312c6821,What is the first name of the person that is warned about keeping the marriage alive by trying new things?,Corinne,Corinne's,bert,e06ca4a9106d473af6df0da13e73e681,What is the first name of the person that is warned about keeping the marriage alive by trying new things?,Corinne,Corinne's closest friend Annika,bert,7d7b76376f269d7d2431320957d28e3d,What is the first name of the person that is warned about keeping the marriage alive by trying new things?,Corinne,children—Abigail,bert,3d60ad325bb12cf45f7c40f3e4f7555d,What is the first name of the person that is warned about keeping the marriage alive by trying new things?,Corinne,"children—Abigail and Lilly—amid a community of self-described ""Jesus freaks"".

"In the early months of the Second World War, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine sends out merchant raiders to attack Allied shipping. The Royal Navy responds with hunting groups whose mission is to stop them. The group that finds the heavily armed pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee near South America is outgunned: Graf Spee is equipped with long-range 11-inch guns, while the British heavy cruiser Exeter has much lighter 8-inch guns, and the light cruisers Ajax and Achilles have 6-inch guns. Despite this, they go straight to the attack. The British are led by Commodore Harwood, with Captain Woodhouse commanding flagship Ajax, Captain Bell Exeter and Captain Parry Achilles. The British use their superior numbers to ""split her fire"" by attacking from different directions, but Graf Spee, under Captain Hans Langsdorff, inflicts much damage on her foes; Exeter is particularly hard hit and is forced to retire. However, Graf Spee sustains damage herself, and takes refuge in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay to make repairs. According to international law, the ship may remain at neutral harbour only long enough to make repairs for seaworthiness, not to refit her for battle. With reinforcements too far away, the British spread disinformation that an overwhelming force is lying in wait, hoping to buy time: while they are initially demanding that the Uruguayan authorities send the Graf Spee out to sea within 24 hours, as the law dictates, they suddenly seem to lose interest and appear to tolerate her staying at anchor in Montevideo for as long as required. This is a bluff intended to make the Germans believe that more British warships have arrived, when only the cruiser HMS Cumberland has.  Taken in by this ruse, Langsdorff takes his ship out with a skeleton crew aboard, and as she heads down the River Plate for the open sea, he orders her scuttled.",2b04ada5e51136b3f2d642ceb31d09cc,How long is Captain Langsdorff's ship allowed to stay in port for repairs?,24 hours,24,bert,e0df4cc2692eca26a7eec74495363c2a,How long is Captain Langsdorff's ship allowed to stay in port for repairs?,24 hours,hours,bert,a7bb4e96f53803d2fb7bc4a4ce154413,How long is Captain Langsdorff's ship allowed to stay in port for repairs?,24 hours,the Graf Spee,bert,92c5a7b381f7c2482931ee17ceb22030,How long is Captain Langsdorff's ship allowed to stay in port for repairs?,24 hours,the Graf Spee out to sea within 24,bert,0ff64dfe6c8ca205a7daa3dc92fdd50b,How long is Captain Langsdorff's ship allowed to stay in port for repairs?,24 hours,"the Graf Spee out to sea within 24 hours,",bert,77add83b8b675882f3dabe7303779bc1,What are the full names of the captains of the Allied ships?,Captain Woodhouse,Admiral Graf Spee,bert,d75ff4b876d46584bc121744439e2b93,What are the full names of the captains of the Allied ships?,Captain Woodhouse,Bell Exeter,bert,7dcb9da7bec8b3b4cc898b168aece903,What are the full names of the captains of the Allied ships?,Captain Woodhouse,Captain Bell Exeter,bert,39eaaf27928351698f0c961adc784df8,What are the full names of the captains of the Allied ships?,Captain Woodhouse,"Captain Hans Langsdorff,",bert,5157b9428c3b0155d97e49953a71b86a,What are the full names of the captains of the Allied ships?,Captain Woodhouse,"Commodore Harwood, with Captain Woodhouse commanding flagship Ajax, Captain Bell Exeter",bert,4e5528c3d9066a938abfa300c1764023,What are the full names of the captains of the Allied ships?,Captain Woodhouse,"Hans Langsdorff,",bert,682efc53307e2d535e1f9aecc7f7e763,What do the British want the Graf Spee crew to think by not insisting they leave port?,that more British warships have arrived,disinformation,bert,878ad0d18731daf2f6d9554f24d3f5f6,What do the British want the Graf Spee crew to think by not insisting they leave port?,that more British warships have arrived,"disinformation that an overwhelming force is lying in wait, hoping to buy time",bert,ed13c274d160dd7732f558e9c5c65e49,What do the British want the Graf Spee crew to think by not insisting they leave port?,that more British warships have arrived,"disinformation that an overwhelming force is lying in wait, hoping to buy time: while they are initially demanding that the Uruguayan authorities",bert,3826e169dd0eb2ccedde6a6a629d355f,What do the British want the Graf Spee crew to think by not insisting they leave port?,that more British warships have arrived,interest,bert,2735e52c38db91403fff1644f10ccb74,What do the British want the Graf Spee crew to think by not insisting they leave port?,that more British warships have arrived,lose interest,bert,bdfe510adb8d7a9bf30f50ed5f18fe89,What do the British want the Graf Spee crew to think by not insisting they leave port?,that more British warships have arrived,suddenly seem to lose interest,bert,e98dbc7d70a551e693bd21fe0df4f9ea,What do the enemies of Germany use to trick the Graf Spee?,disinformation that an overwhelming force is lying in wait,"heavily armed pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee near South America is outgunned: Graf Spee is equipped with long-range 11-inch guns,",bert,9cf1197fdaaf1b390b9ed39dbd43e1a1,What do the enemies of Germany use to trick the Graf Spee?,disinformation that an overwhelming force is lying in wait,long-range 11-inch guns,bert,73679f7904710f7b586a3cc996b080d5,What do the enemies of Germany use to trick the Graf Spee?,disinformation that an overwhelming force is lying in wait,merchant raiders,bert,3ed98ad77f1448907b4f5bb6349b6e71

"In the heyday of vaudeville, on the verge of America's entrance into World War I, two talented performers, Jo Hayden and Harry Palmer, set their sights on playing the Palace Theatre on Broadway, the epitome of vaudeville success, and marrying immediately after. Just weeks before their plans are to be realized Harry gets a draft notice. Intending to obtain a short delay before reporting for duty, he intentionally smashes his hand in a trunk.  That same day Jo is notified that her brother, who had been studying to be a doctor, has died in the war. When she realizes what Harry has done, she rejects him and leaves the act. Harry then tries to undo his rash act and enlist, but none of the armed services will take him as his hand has been permanently crippled. Eventually he resigns himself to participating in the war effort the only way left open to him, entertaining front line troops for the YMCA. When he and his partner find themselves dangerously close to the front, Harry heroically sets out to warn off an ambulance convoy heading into an artillery bombardment. He is wounded while destroying an enemy machine gun emplacement ambushing the convoy and is apparently commended for his bravery. After the war, during a victory performance at the Palace Theatre, Jo sees Harry in the audience and runs to him.

"In the middle of the night a strange masked man goes to the kingdom of Trumbeau. There, he makes a huge hole underneath a dam near the village where everybody is fast asleep and disappears. The next morning Derek, Odette and Chef Ferdinand are going to the village to have a trade agreement meeting. The Trumbeau's king and his wife were friends of King William, Odette's late father. King William once saved his life and Odette mentioned that her father often had told her about that. While the meeting is going on, Ferdinand tries to get some new plants; unfortunately they are sold to a man named Count Antonio. Furious, Ferdinand runs to Derek, explaining what happened. They stumble upon the water leaking from the dam and alert the villagers to find higher grounds. Even Count Antonio saves a boy. The water destroys all the houses and the people don't know where to go.

"In the palace at Ithaca, Penelope mourns the long absence of Ulysses: ""The awaited one does not return, and the years pass by."" Her grief is echoed by her nurse, Ericlea. As Penelope leaves, her attendant Melanto enters with Eurimaco, a servant to Penelope's importunate suitors. The two sing passionately of their love for each other (""You are my sweet life""). The scene changes to the Ithacan coast, where the sleeping Ulisse is brought ashore by the Phaecians (Faeci), whose action is in defiance of the wishes of gods Giove and Nettuno. The Phaecians are punished by the gods who turn them and their ship to stone. Ulysses awakes, cursing the Phaecians for abandoning him: ""To your sails, falsest Phaeacians, may Boreas be ever hostile!"" From the goddess Minerva, who appears disguised as a shepherd boy, Ulisse learns that he is in Ithaca, and is told of ""the unchanging constancy of the chaste Penelope"", in the face of the persistent importunings of her evil suitors. Minerva promises to lead Ulisse back to the throne if he follows her advice; she tells him to disguise himself so that he can penetrate the court secretly. Ulisse goes to seek out his loyal servant Eumete, while Minerva departs to search for Telemaco, Ulisse's son who will help his father reclaim the kingdom. Back at the palace, Melanto tries vainly to persuade Penelope to choose one of the suitors: ""Why do you disdain the love of living suitors, expecting comfort from the ashes of the dead?"" In a wooded grove Eumete, banished from court by the suitors, revels in the pastoral life, despite the mockery of Iro, the suitors' parasitic follower, who sneers: ""I live among kings, you here among the herds."" After Iro is chased away, Ulisse enters disguised as a beggar, and assures Eumete that his master the king is alive, and will return. Eumete is overjoyed: ""My long sorrow will fall, vanquished by you.""",fdee698cda5686d89ade9e1b46fb63f0,What are the exact names of the two individuals who sing passionately of their love for each other?,Melanto,"Ericlea.

"In the spring of 1948 Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate William Zeckendorf to join a staff of architects for his firm of Webb and Knapp to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.His first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage. Pei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949, when he designed a two-story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained as part of an apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior curtain wall brought praise from the journal Architectural Forum. Pei's designs echoed the work of Mies van der Rohe in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including Henry N. Cobb and Ulrich Franzen. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.",f33c8f7f3099f8dd5f1cc709fc5f83fb,What are the last names of the people that were chosen to become associates by the real estate magnate that was well connected politically?,Cobb,Cobb and Ulrich Franzen.,bert,edfc461c2eff720cde5ad5ed861a6022,What are the last names of the people that were chosen to become associates by the real estate magnate that was well connected politically?,Cobb,Henry N.

"In the wake of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott organised the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott saw no reason to believe that his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.Amundsen concealed his revised intentions until his ship, Fram, was in the Atlantic and beyond communication. Scott was notified by telegram that a rival was in the field, but had little choice other than to continue with his own plans. Meanwhile, Fram arrived at the Ross Ice Shelf on 11 January 1911, and by 14 January had found the inlet, or ""Bay of Whales"", where Borchgrevink had made his landing eleven years earlier. This became the location of Amundsen's base camp, Framheim.After nine months' preparation, Amundsen's polar journey began on 20 October 1911. Avoiding the known route to the polar plateau via the Beardmore Glacier, Amundsen led his party of five due south, reaching the Transantarctic Mountains on 16 November. They discovered the Axel Heiberg Glacier, which provided them with a direct route to the polar plateau  and  on to the pole.  Shackleton's Farthest South mark was passed on 7 December, and the South Pole  was reached on 14 December 1911. The Norwegian party's greater skills with the techniques of ice travel, using ski and dogs, had proved decisive in their success. Captain Scott's five-man team reached the same point 33 days later, and perished during their return journey. Since Cook's journeys, every expedition that had held the Farthest South record before Amundsen's conquest had been British; however, the final triumph indisputably belonged to the Norwegians.",4272e8b045e41bc1ae09ef29582401eb,How many days after Amundsen's team did the team that was trying to secure the south pole for the British Empire get there?,33,33 days,bert,f8b36b756be5c70f6e26b2e032f42f71,How many days after Amundsen's team did the team that was trying to secure the south pole for the British Empire get there?,33,33 days later,bert,ad1baf72ef564e6f68741288c1ad7750,How many days after Amundsen's team did the team that was trying to secure the south pole for the British Empire get there?,33,nine,bert,3afade68aa3423866c072bf1824c34db,How many days after Amundsen's team did the team that was trying to secure the south pole for the British Empire get there?,33,nine months,bert,2ffa3339f29cb5364cc48535790f7dde,How many days later than the Norweigan team did the team that's prime objective was securing the South Pole for the British Empire reach the South Pole?,33,33 days,bert,1d222f23c3e94c4fde5be689a6a693d7,How many days later than the Norweigan team did the team that's prime objective was securing the South Pole for the British Empire reach the South Pole?,33,33 days later,bert,5469a6a9e7808140822efcaf3d03754a,How many days later than the Norweigan team did the team that's prime objective was securing the South Pole for the British Empire reach the South Pole?,33,Captain Scott's five-man team reached the same point 33,bert,aac1eb7ea329900e02e25a6ff88fc2da,How many days later than the Norweigan team did the team that's prime objective was securing the South Pole for the British Empire reach the South Pole?,33,Captain Scott's five-man team reached the same point 33 days,bert,617c7a7c88c4036ae6ee2c4e83bd1e9a,How many days later than the Norweigan team did the team that's prime objective was securing the South Pole for the British Empire reach the South Pole?,33,"Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13,",bert,6562b7e4338821b958adbe74d66a43d2,On what date did the team that first reached the south pole pass Shackleton's Farthest South mark?,7 December,14 December,bert,4dd57b4635f4e3587dfa2fe020aa703b,On what date did the team that first reached the south pole pass Shackleton's Farthest South mark?,7 December,14 December 1911.,bert,61df37175f94d699e108dad50e0da09e,On what date did the team that first reached the south pole pass Shackleton's Farthest South mark?,7 December,"7 December, and the South Pole was reached on 14 December",bert,7da3b8bf566be62450de95c9f94fd2fb,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"In this quirky dark comedy Santiago Morales a former engineer, is unable to come to terms with the passing of his wife Viviana who has died of cancer. Santiago rents a room in a house as he struggles to get his financial affairs from the marriage sorted out. He quickly becomes suicidal, obsessing over his late wife by watching videos of her on an iPad and building a shrine to her in his room. Santiago is very particular and keeps things neat, tidy, and organized which leads to clashes with his housemate/landlord Murray who is a total slob and spends most of his time in his underwear in the living room of the house surrounded by trash and clutter. Santiago discovers that Murray is actually a disgraced geneticist with too much time on his hands. Murray was a rising star in the cloning field until he was caught conducting illegal experiments and was fired. He is itching to get back in the saddle so together they devise a plan involving the other housemate, Laura, to clone Santiago's dead wife and thereby bring her back to life.  Laura has just lost her waitressing job and is unable to pay her debts so when presented with a relative financial windfall for her role, she reluctantly agrees to take part in the scheme to be the surrogate for their bizarro cloning experiment. The film is unique and offbeat as the often twisted humour is made genuinely funny by the actors. The logic and consequenses of the characters schemes seem secondary. For example, it doesn't appear to bother Santiago that his wife would be a baby and not in fact ""Viviana"" in any way other than genetically. In fact he misses her to such an extreme that its hard not to end up rooting for him to see her.",92e8c1c9696ad857a00b7e23910d0af5,What did the person who lives with the former engineer and the geneticist do for a job until recently?,waitressing,"conducting illegal experiments and was fired.

Santiago is very particular and keeps things neat, tidy, and organized which leads to clashes with his housemate/landlord Murray who is a total slob and spends most of his time in his underwear in the living room of the house surrounded by trash and clutter. Santiago discovers that Murray is actually a disgraced geneticist with too much time on his hands. Murray was a rising star in the cloning field until he was caught conducting illegal experiments and was fired. He is itching to get back in the saddle so together they devise a plan involving the other housemate, Laura, to clone Santiago's dead wife and thereby bring her back to life.  Laura has just lost her waitressing job and is unable to pay her debts so when presented with a relative financial windfall for her role, she reluctantly agrees to take part in the scheme to be the surrogate for their bizarro cloning experiment. The film is unique and offbeat as the often twisted humour is made genuinely funny by the actors. The logic and consequenses of the characters schemes seem secondary. For example, it doesn't appear to bother Santiago that his wife would be a baby and not in fact ""Viviana"" in any way other than genetically. In fact he misses her to such an extreme that its hard not to end up rooting for him to see her.",d8d52dbcfeb56cdd516c93d5ec0339f7,What is the name of the person who is being cloned?,Viviana,Laura,bert,a2e9379ac81ffcc7859ffced1f3d2307,What is the name of the person who is being cloned?,Viviana,"Laura, to clone Santiago's dead wife",bert,bf4fecb5ed9d7f8d7d23d10cbf6fb8b0,What is the name of the person who is being cloned?,Viviana,"Laura, to clone Santiago's dead wife and thereby bring her back to life.

"Innocent young Connie Heath is persuaded to borrow a party dress from her friend, ""fast girl"" Hilda Engstrom, who has actually misappropriated it from the dry cleaner where she works. After the real owner of the dress, witchy Gloria Adams, spots Connie out in the dress (which is subsequently torn in a car door), Connie is falsely accused of theft and prosecuted as Hilda flees town and leaves her to take the blame. Though Gloria withdraws her charge, the insurance company continues to persecute poor Connie, resulting in a charge of grand larceny. Championing her cause is crusading attorney Neil Dillon (Ronald Reagan)- coincidentally, also Connie's date on the evening in question- who gets Connie off with probation.  Connie leaves town after being mistreated by her unsympathetic father and gets a job in order to pay for the damaged dress.  One day she spots Hilda waiting in a parked car on the street and begins to argue with her in the car when Hilda's boyfriend emerges from a bank he has just robbed, fleeing the scene with Connie in tow. She is arrested and convicted while refusing to give her real name or full story for fear of humiliating her family. Eventually the truth begins to emerge, and Connie is given probation, returns home, and becomes engaged to Dillon. When Hilda is given probation, she returns to town as well, to make even more trouble for Connie, especially after her boyfriend escapes prison.",121780a8385b2694c220cb1b7c0823fe,What is the first name of the person that the attorney represents in the theft case?,Connie,"Connie Heath is persuaded to borrow a party dress from her friend, ""fast girl"" Hilda",bert,daa5b06b3c2f1189758d7dd353c7d6cd,What is the first name of the person that the attorney represents in the theft case?,Connie,Connie is falsely accused of theft and prosecuted as Hilda,bert,6fe2469b3ecf0b9b756f42de91494df8,What is the first name of the person that the attorney represents in the theft case?,Connie,Hilda,bert,fd25ba7ba485da2ae49b2da0d51ab62d,What is the first name of the person that the attorney represents in the theft case?,Connie,"Hilda flees town and leaves her to take the blame.

"Interest in Monteverdi revived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among music scholars in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the Orfeo score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following the discovery of the L'incoronazione manuscript in 1888 and that of Il ritorno in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or other, during the first quarter of the 20th century: L'Orfeo in May 1911, L'incoronazione in February 1913 and Il ritorno in May 1925.The Italian nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio lauded Monteverdi and in his novel Il fuoco (1900) wrote of ""il divino Claudio ... what a heroic soul, purely Italian in its essence!"" His vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism was adopted by musicians who worked with the regime of Benito Mussolini (1922–1945), including Francesco Malipiero, Luigi Dallapiccola, and Mario Labroca, who contrasted Monteverdi with the decadence of the music of Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky.In the years after the Second World War the operas began to be performed in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 Vespers were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later. Modern editions of the Selva morales and Missa e Salmi volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.",c5f863cbc51ea11e367e1a7527f7591f,What is the last name of the person who did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did?,Monteverdi,Monteverdi's,bert,dff93cd9b31ed6564c5e31ef78684e41,What is the last name of the person who did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did?,Monteverdi,verdi,bert,75fcec37297e5c13748a42c4a46713a0,What is the last name of the person who had a vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism?,D'Annunzio,D'Annunzio lauded Monteverdi,bert,f7cadd3b19c0636ebc957340af769d2e,What is the last name of the person who had a vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism?,D'Annunzio,Gabriele D'Annunzio,bert,3721c57079546bdad17f80e9b72e8167,What is the last name of the person who had a vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism?,D'Annunzio,Gabriele D'Annunzio lauded Monteverdi,bert,f485c4e4487758b1012a21d7600ab72a,What is the last name of the person who had a vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism?,D'Annunzio,Monteverdi,bert,87ff281ada2a357d512743328a63ee3f,What is the last name of the person who had a vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism?,D'Annunzio,"Monteverdi and in his novel Il fuoco (1900) wrote of ""il divino Claudio",bert,34d5ea96122d20fbf5fce86f05132a3b,What is the last name of the person who wrote the Orfeo score?,Monteverdi,Eitner,bert,81988e3a3c3707d5979d946116711b38,What is the last name of the person who wrote the Orfeo score?,Monteverdi,Eitner published a shortened version of the Orfeo score.

"Iris is a shy young professional who doesn't want to rock the boat at the office where she temps. Margaret is the polar opposite, and serves as a catalyst to help Iris become more assertive. Paula eagerly awaits post-work happy hours and the chance to flirt with attractive men. Jane (Ubach) is engaged to marry a jerk who is already cheating on her. Margaret hopes to become a permanent employee as an assistant to Mr. Lasky, but her dreams are thwarted when he suddenly dies. The four temps form a camaraderie which assists them in getting through their boring and tedious days at work. A series of thefts occur in the office and suspicion falls on the temps, particularly Margaret. When Iris finds a plastic monkey inside Margaret's desk that she had thought was stolen, Iris loses faith in Margaret and believes that she is the office thief. Margaret suggests a one-day strike from work due to mistreatment and being under appreciated as temps, and her friends halfheartedly agree to join her, but on the appointed day Margaret is the only one who does not come to work. As a result, the company's officious head of human resources fires Margaret, and management micromanages the remaining three temps. Iris, Paula and Jane's friendship comes to an end as result of the stress, ending the camaraderie among the temporary workers, and eventually they all go their separate ways. Paula is upset when she learns of Jane's wedding from a newspaper announcement, to which she was not invited, and leaves to work in another department. It is later discovered that another employee (a rich girl who was hired as a permanent employee after her first day) was the thief and that Margaret simply had a similar toy in her desk. Iris confronts the thief when her diary disappears; Iris later receives a new diary and note of apology.",8f0645046a95220a29c9df1233e15ace,What dreams of Margaret are thwarted when Mr. Lasky dies?,to become a permanent employee,Iris,bert,dd944f02035dd20bd1ddc835a880fa1c,What dreams of Margaret are thwarted when Mr. Lasky dies?,to become a permanent employee,Jane,bert,62da8363c3772b6d80291acff6589f59,What dreams of Margaret are thwarted when Mr. Lasky dies?,to become a permanent employee,Jane (Ubach) is engaged to marry a jerk who is already cheating on her.

"It is the Florida Everglades in 1863. Four deserters of the Confederate Army—Sergeant Todd, Plunkett, Cockney and the Kid—are hiding out. The Colonel, a fellow deserter, appears from the brush with a note from an Indian who has arranged to take him to the ocean so he may be taken to Cuba. When the Indian guide is found dead by Seminoles, the foursome reluctantly join forces with the Colonel in order to reach the coast and ride out the rest of the Civil War. As the group treks through the dangerous Florida everglades, it's revealed that Plunkett has stolen a large amount of gold from the Confederate army, which Cockney wants to steal from him.

"It is the Florida Everglades in 1863. Four deserters of the Confederate Army—Sergeant Todd, Plunkett, Cockney and the Kid—are hiding out. The Colonel, a fellow deserter, appears from the brush with a note from an Indian who has arranged to take him to the ocean so he may be taken to Cuba. When the Indian guide is found dead by Seminoles, the foursome reluctantly join forces with the Colonel in order to reach the coast and ride out the rest of the Civil War. As the group treks through the dangerous Florida everglades, it's revealed that Plunkett has stolen a large amount of gold from the Confederate army, which Cockney wants to steal from him.

"It is winter time and Krazy is in his horse-drawn sleigh, running through the snowy outdoors. Next, he stops over at the house of his spaniel girlfriend. Krazy then calls and invites her to go out with him. Showing herself through a window, the spaniel discloses she cannot come outside because her door is blocked by thick snow. In this, Krazy and his horse goes on to clear the doorway. In just a short while, the impeding snow has been removed, and the spaniel finally steps out. They then head off in the sleigh. Krazy and the spaniel arrive at their destination, the frozen lake. They then put on their ice skates and set foot on the ice. For several moments, things are going very smooth for them. Their movements are fluent and they never stumble into things. This is until Krazy crashes into a wooden barrel and starts to lose control. He then overshoots the edge of the lake and gets himself into a snowy slope. As he tumbles down the slope, Krazy becomes covered in snow and immediately becomes a large rampaging snowball. The snowball bashes a cabin and rolls into a barn where it runs over the farm animals. Finally, it spatters onto a larger house, and Krazy is free at last. Just nearby him is the spaniel who is relieved to know he is unharmed. Without further ado, they continue looking for ways to spend time in the frosty landscape.",c9787b5316e1f56221b2fdaaf21c7d91,Who are the two that head off in the sleigh?,Krazy,Krazy and the spaniel,bert,e0c86fe472a98ada3ddcccdd35f50e02,Who are the two that head off in the sleigh?,Krazy,the spaniel,bert,89800cd7b9b4d2a10e976b455675d509,Who are the two that head off in the sleigh?,Krazy,the spaniel finally steps out.

"James Weddell was an Anglo-Scottish seaman who saw service in both the Royal Navy and the merchant marine before undertaking his first voyages to Antarctic waters. In 1819, in command of the 160-ton brigantine Jane which had been adapted for whaling, he set sail for the newly discovered whaling grounds of the South Sandwich Islands. His chief interest on this voyage was in finding the ""Aurora Islands"", which had been reported at 53°S, 48°W by the Spanish ship Aurora in 1762.  He failed to discover this non-existent land, but his sealing activities showed a handsome profit. In 1822 Weddell, again in command of Jane and this time accompanied by the smaller ship Beaufort, set sail for the south with instructions from his employers that, should the sealing prove barren, he was to ""investigate beyond the track of former navigators"". This suited Weddell's exploring instincts, and he equipped his vessel with chronometers, thermometers, compasses, barometers and charts. In January 1823 he probed the waters between the South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkney Islands, looking for new land. Finding none, he turned southward down the 40°W meridian, deep into the sea that now bears his name. The season was unusually calm, and Weddell reported that ""not a particle of ice of any description was to be seen"". On 20 February 1823, he reached a new Farthest South of 74°15'S, three degrees beyond Cook's former record.  Unaware that he was close to land, Weddell decided to return northward from this point, convinced that the sea continued as far as the South Pole. Another two days' sailing would likely have brought him within sight of Coats Land, which was not discovered until 1904, by William Speirs Bruce during the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, 1902–04.

"Japanese bride Midori Takada arrives in Sydney with her new husband Yukio. She believes her marriage is a mistake and uses the honeymoon as a means to escape. Colin O'Brien is an experienced getaway driver. He is hired by an Australian-Afghan family to help rob a bank. During the robbery one member is killed. Midori is in the bank at the same time and they grab her as a hostage. After escaping, the two Afghan brothers decide to get rid of her. Colin will not allow this. He kills one of the brothers and threatens to shoot the other, Mahood. He and Midori escape. Colin wishes to travel to see his father, Cam, at his ranch because he hasn't seen him in years. Midori chooses to stay with Colin. The duo rob a bank to fund their trip. Mahood and his father, Boorjan, swear revenge and set out to catch Colin. The police, aware of the Afghani family's illegal activities, are also in pursuit. Yukio is told of his wife's involvement and he is aware that she left him by choice. His honor injured, he goes to find her. Colin and Midori venture across New South Wales.

"Jason is sitting on a bench in New York City waiting for someone to arrive. A voiceover explains that he has been waiting for a long time, but to explain why, he needs to go back to the beginning. Jason begins by telling the audience that every relationship reaches the ""So..."" moment, where someone in the relationship will want to take the relationship to a more serious place. At that point, Jason knows the relationship is over, as he is not ready to start dating. Jason is currently working with his best friend Daniel at a publishing house designing book covers. Their friend Mikey, a young doctor who has been married to Vera since the end of college, comes to them after Vera requests a divorce. The three decide to go out to a bar and celebrate being single. The group meets up with Daniel's female wingman, Chelsea, as they try to get Mikey's mind off of his wife. Mikey meets a girl with glasses, while Jason meets Ellie, and hits it off with her after teasing another man that was trying to buy her a drink. Mikey gets the girl's number, but decides not to call, resolving to work it out with his wife. Jason sleeps with Ellie, but escapes her apartment when he discovers circumstantial evidence that she may be a prostitute.",ce1a63af4dd969d28102c1d31d068af3,What are the first names of the three people that go to a bar to celebrate being single?,Jason,"Daniel at a publishing house designing book covers.

"Jerry, a secret agent, drives a micro dragster through the street of a town (the buildings in the opening shot suggest Westminster, London) and enters his secret headquarters through a cigar store Indian. His mission is to infiltrate the mansion of Tom Thrush and recover a refrigerator with a large amount of cheese. Before taking the operation out, he checks all of the weapons inside his coat. But when he shows his weapons, they fire, creating several holes on the coat as he comically grins at the ""audience"". After the opening credits, Tom (notably with a gap in his teeth in this cartoon) sets some traps for Jerry, including an exploding robot female mouse, as he drives to Tom's mansion, outside of the city. These prove mostly ineffective at stopping Jerry. Tom manages to reach the safeguarded room and sets even more traps, such as mines, blades, cannons, and barbed wire. Jerry plays a tape-recorder; it sounds as if he is walking through the room. Tom waits a few seconds, then says ""Boom!"" Not hearing the explosions that should result from the walking, Tom runs  in and gets attacked by his own traps as a result. After that, Tom ""helps"" Jerry by opening the safe that keeps the refrigerator as he has lost his sanity and self-control (due to the traps that he ran over). Jerry thanks Tom by lifting his fedora up as he now has the refrigerator. Jerry straps the refrigerator to his micro dragster and Tom crawls out the front door, in a very bad way following the incident. His hand lands on the ""Play"" button of Jerry's tape player, and the song ""Taps"" starts to play. Tom picks a flower and lays it on his chest, indicating that he is dying from the incident.

"Jess Wade, a former member of a gang of outlaws led by Vince Hackett, was led to believe that an old flame, Tracy Winters, wanted to meet him in a seedy Mexican saloon.  Jess saw Billy Roy Hackett, Vince's younger brother, summoning Vince and the other members of the gang into the saloon, and realized he was being set up.  Jess ordered the bar patrons to leave before a shootout ensued.  Making a break for the door, Jess was stopped by Gunner, another gang member, and was forced to relinquish his gun and to go with them to their hideout in the mountains.  Vince later told him that the gang had stolen a gold-plated cannon that was used by Emperor Maximilian in his ill-fated fight against popular Mexican leader Benito Juarez.  Vince informed him that, according to a wanted poster, Jess was in the gang who stole the cannon and had sustained a neck wound as a result of being shot by one of the guards. Ordering his men to subdue Jess on the ground, Vince used a branding iron to burn his neck.  They took his horse, leaving him stranded.  He captured a wild horse in the desert and saddle-broke it.

"Johann Sebastian Bach composed the secular cantata Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht (Time, which day and year doth make), BWV 134.1, BWV 134a, while he was in the service of the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. Bach wrote the work as a  serenata for the celebration of New Year's Day 1719. The libretto by Christian Friedrich Hunold, an academic at the University of Halle, takes the form of a dialogue between two allegorical figures, Time and Divine Providence, representing the past and future, respectively. Bach set the words in eight movements consisting of alternating recitatives and arias, culminating in a choral finale. Most movements are duets of solo voices, an alto as Divine Providence and a tenor as Time. Even the closing movement features long duet passages, leading to parts for four voices. The singers are supported by a baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes, two violins, viola and continuo. The character of the music is close to baroque opera, including French dances. Later, in Leipzig, Bach used the secular cantata as the basis for a church cantata for the Third Day of Easter 1724, Ein Herz, das seinen Jesum lebend weiß. In the initial version of the Easter cantata, he made no changes to the 1719 music other than to omit two movements and replace the text with words for the occasion, written by an unknown author. In an adaptation for performances in the 1730s, he composed new recitatives for the Easter texts and made further changes to the music. The cantata, written for a specific occasion, has been performed and recorded rarely, compared with other Bach cantatas. It has been used for congratulatory events such as the 80th birthday of Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, when the cantata title was chosen as that of an international conference about chronology in Bach's music, on which Dürr had focused.",7a66015f7daa43b40b4573ca53b3b80f,What has been used for congratulatory events such as the 80th birthday of Bach scholar Alfred Dürr?,"Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht","Ein Herz, das seinen Jesum lebend weiß.",bert,f90d7bbccc03abac5ca8eb3d5e3d88cb,What has been used for congratulatory events such as the 80th birthday of Bach scholar Alfred Dürr?,"Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht","Ein Herz, das seinen Jesum lebend weiß.

"John Ottway works in Alaska as a marksman for an undisclosed oil company, killing grey wolves that threaten the drillers. On his last day on the job, he sees a driller  being pursued by a wolf and shoots it. He then watches and listens as the wolf takes a final breath ending in a long deep exhale. That evening, Ottway writes a letter ""without purpose"" to his wife, Ana, explaining his plans to commit suicide. He hears a distant wolf howl and doesn't follow through. The next day, Ottway and other oil drillers board a plane. During the flight, Ottway dreams of sleeping with his wife in bed but is awakened by a loud bang. He buckles up in fear of a possible plane crash. Shortly afterwards, the back of the plane is torn off and it crashes. Eight people including Ottway survive the crash. However, a young oil worker, Lewenden, dies of his injuries as Ottway sadly watches. Taking charge, Ottway sets the survivors on the task of building a fire. While doing this, he discovers a corpse, and is attacked by the grey wolf feeding on it. After saving Ottway, the group soon surmises that they are in the wolves' territory. They decide to take turns keeping watch for the predators. Later, Hernandez is killed by two wolves. Ottway suggests they leave the crash site, but Diaz questions his leadership. While searching for the wallets of their deceased colleagues, intending to return them to their families, Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch containing a radio beacon.

"Justin Quayle, a low-level British diplomat and horticultural hobbyist posted in Kenya, learns that his wife Tessa was found dead in the veld. Tessa has been murdered at a crossroads along with her Kenyan driver. Her colleague, Dr. Arnold Bluhm, initially suspected of her murder, is then found to have been murdered on the same day as Tessa. Various rumours abound that the two were having an affair; it is later revealed that Bluhm was gay. In flashbacks, we see how in London, Justin met his future wife Tessa, an outspoken humanitarian and Amnesty International activist. He falls in love with her, and she persuades him to take her back with him to Kenya. Despite their loving marriage, Tessa keeps from Justin the reason why she approached him in the first place: to investigate a suspicious drug trial in Kenya and expose it. When Tessa starts getting too close to uncovering the malpractices of an influential and powerful pharmaceutical company, she and her colleague are brutally murdered. As the mystery surrounding his wife's death unfolds, Justin becomes determined to get to the bottom of her murder. He soon runs up against a drug corporation that is using Kenya's population for fraudulent testing of a tuberculosis drug. The drug has known harmful side effects, but the corporation completely disregards the well-being of its impoverished African test subjects.",321fd497a83dd7572a02c8b06c19e669,What is the last name of the person who was murdered?,Quayle,Bluhm,bert,f5b89d1b38f9422575e8fa0cc369dd7c,What is the last name of the person who was murdered?,Quayle,"Quayle, a low-level British diplomat and horticultural hobbyist posted in Kenya, learns that his wife Tessa",bert,7808f0ffd7e7e405d30d03d4cc127219,What is the last name of the person who was murdered?,Quayle,"Tessa was found dead in the veld.

"Kate is traveling around Ireland in an R.V. with her ex-boyfriend Ryan, brother Joel and friends Hailey, Chuck, Tommy and Anita. After driving into the countryside, the group stop off at a small shop, where they encounter Luca who attempts to scam them from buying a medallion, and warns them it is dangerous before Chuck steals the medallion and the group attempt to make a quick get-away. However, as they drive away in their R.V. they hit an old woman, who puts a curse on the group, telling them the mythical bird the roc will take vengeance on them, before dying. The group quickly drive away in their R.V. but hit a patch of thick fog and become lost, as fears of the curse heighten. Stopping the R.V. they encounter a young boy in the road.

"Kathleen Davis is a 13-year-old who lives in a big house with a nanny, a butler, maids, and no mother. Her father, John Davis, spends most of his time at work, and has little time to spend with his daughter. She dreams of a traditional family, and tells her friends that she has such a family. Because of this fib, she cannot invite any friends to her home, as they will see the truth. Kathleen and her nanny, Mrs. Farrell, have a contentious relationship. Mr. Davis dismisses the nanny, and hires a psychologist named Dr. Angela Kent to look after the young girl for the summer. He has begun seeing a woman named Lorraine Bennett, whom he considers marrying. But Lorraine and Kathleen dislike each other intensely. Instead, Kathleen envisions Dr. Kent as the perfect mother for her, and wife for her father. When this seems unlikely, Kathleen runs away from home.

"King Kung Fu tells the story of a good-humored, hat-loving, Chinese talking gorilla originally named Jungle Jumper who has been taught karate. After beating up his Kung Fu Master owner, Alfunku, when the latter dared him to snatch a banana from his hand, he is shipped off to the U.S. as a ""goodwill gift"" by his battered and embarrassed teacher, where he is renamed King Kung Fu for publicity purposes. On the way to the New York Zoo, the ""Monster Master of the Martial Arts"" is put on display in Wichita, Kansas, where two out-of-work reporters set him free with plans to ""capture"" him and get jobs. Police Captain J.W. Duke (who resembles a certain Western Movie star) and his patriotic-helmeted little assistant, Officer Pilgrim, get involved in the citywide chase along with the phony-looking ape's love interest, Rae Fey (a beautiful blonde Pizza Hut waitress/model). Rae Fey is the only one who understands that Fu just wants to see the sights like any other tourist. Her conniving TV journalist boyfriend, Bo Burgess (not Beau Bridges as has been listed in some sources, a reference no doubt to the actor's brother Jeff who starred in the first remake of King Kong), and his hapless sidekick, Herman, a pair of prudish protesters from ""OLD HAGS"" (""Outraged Ladies Dedicated to Hiding Animals Great Shame""), and a host of others including cops, cowboys and baseball players partake in a wild chase in order to catch the ape. The gorilla and the girl end up on top of the tallest building in Wichita, a Holiday Inn and homage to the original King Kong film, where the hairy hero makes a final stand involving instances of stop motion animation.",4423e91c29d56a19e698caa9e7e2fa0f,What are the full names of who ends up on top of the tallest building?,King Kung Fu,Bo Burgess,bert,2ed4d64caf2e8827135ed62519c79e6f,What are the full names of who ends up on top of the tallest building?,King Kung Fu,J.W.

"LAPD Sergeant Joe Friday's nephew and namesake, whose anachronistic views reflect those of his late uncle, is involuntarily assigned a smart-alecky, streetwise new partner, Pep Streebek. Their contrasting styles clash at first, with Friday disapproving of Streebek's attitude, hairstyle, and wardrobe.

"Love was cast in several television series in supporting parts throughout 2014 including the FX series Sons of Anarchy, Revenge, and Lee Daniels' network series Empire in a recurring guest role as Elle Dallas. The track ""Walk Out on Me"" featuring Love was included on the Empire: Original Soundtrack from Season 1 album, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised the track, saying: ""The idea of Courtney Love singing a ballad with a group of gospel singers seems faintly terrifying ... the reality is brilliant. Love's voice fits the careworn lyrics, effortlessly summoning the kind of ravaged darkness that Lana Del Rey nearly ruptures herself trying to conjure up.""In January 2015, Love starred in a New York City stage production titled Kansas City Choir Boy, a ""pop opera"" conceived by and co-starring Todd Almond. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times praised her performance, noting a ""soft-edged and bewitching"" stage presence, adding: ""Her voice, never the most supple or rangy of instruments, retains the singular sound that made her an electrifying front woman for the band Hole: a single sustained noted can seem to simultaneously contain a plea, a wound and a threat."" The show toured later in the year, with performances in Boston and Los Angeles. Love saw further legal troubles in April 2015 when journalist Anthony Bozza sued her over an alleged contractual violation regarding his co-writing of her memoir. Love subsequently joined Lana Del Rey on her Endless Summer Tour, performing as an opener on the tour's eight West Coast shows in May–June 2015. During her tenure on Del Rey's tour, Love debuted a new single, ""Miss Narcissist"", released on Wavves' independent label Ghost Ramp. She also was cast in a supporting role in James Franco's film The Long Home, based on William Gay's novel of the same name, marking her first film role in over ten years.",af9fa63e2e8b29f0885a5fda058e276e,What is the full name of the person that was cast in a supporting role in a James Franco film?,Courtney Love,Alexis Petridis,bert,ee3113dc6bbcda22c0783ff76afd1ec9,What is the full name of the person that was cast in a supporting role in a James Franco film?,Courtney Love,"Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised the track, saying: ""The idea of Courtney Love",bert,f596175e67b047e0882386fdd73b93ff,What is the full name of the person that was cast in a supporting role in a James Franco film?,Courtney Love,Elle Dallas.,bert,d9ec0bca48ad60a319d037e5179ff2fd,What is the full name of the person that was cast in a supporting role in a James Franco film?,Courtney Love,"Elle Dallas.

"Madagascar's northeastern rain forests are severely threatened by illegal logging of precious hardwood, which not only dries out the forest (making it susceptible to fire), introduces invasive species, degrades habitat, and reduces genetic diversity, but also violates local taboos and traditions.  Additional species, such as species of Dombeya, are typically cut to make rafts for floating the heavier hardwoods down rivers and out of the parks.  Rosewood trees are cut into multiple logs for easier transport, and five or more high-buoyancy trees are cut per hardwood log.  To tie the rafts together, the loggers cut thousands of lianas or vines, which are used by 75% of the forest fauna as avenues for moving around in the canopy.  The logging activities are labor-intensive and dangerous.  The labor employs the impoverished local population, but the officials who facilitate the process primarily benefit. In 2005, illegal logging of rosewood was reported to have occurred more than 20 times. In 2007 at the port cities of Vohémar, Antalaha, and Toamasina, authorities confiscated thousands of logs valued at millions of dollars (US$).  Some of this material was reportedly logged from eastern and northeastern parts of the park.  At the start of the Malagasy political crisis in March 2009, thousands of woodcutters intensely logged precious hardwoods for six to eight weeks in the SAVA Region.  An estimated 52,000 tons of rosewood lumber, or nearly 100,000 trees, were logged that year, with one-third of the total coming from Marojejy National Park and the remainder from nearby Masoala National Park.  As a result, the park was closed briefly, but reopened in May 2009.  In 2010, the situation improved in Marojejy, but illegal logging intensified in Masoala and the Makira Protected Area.Illegal logging has been facilitated by insufficient governance, unclear forest regulation, and undermined judicial control while the exportation of the acquired logs (in 1992, 2006, and 2009–2010) has been permitted by government decrees that either precede elections or are issued during periods of political instability.  The trade is organized and operated by high-ranking officials and influential businessmen.  Additionally, the trade in Malagasy rosewood is not regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).",fb78fec8febef1bbe5385be2f18f73f2,"In what year were an estimated 52,000 tons of rosewood lumber harvested before the situation improved in Morojejy?",2009,2005,bert,4b55e612a69c9854929930f6b6e18b07,"In what year were an estimated 52,000 tons of rosewood lumber harvested before the situation improved in Morojejy?",2009,"2009.

"Marcel Marnat's catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned. Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra. The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental. Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera, and song cycles. He wrote no symphonies or church works.Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert, Liszt and Chopin. He considered himself in many ways a classicist, often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary, to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies. The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata. Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is ""an implied melodic outline in all vital music"". His themes are frequently modal instead of using the familiar major or minor scales. As a result, there are few leading notes in his output. Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas, such as those in the Valses nobles et sentimentales, are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language.Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, but also the minuet, forlane, rigaudon, waltz, czardas, habanera and passacaglia. National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic, Greek, Hungarian and gypsy themes. He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin, Chabrier, Fauré and Haydn, interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style. Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that ""true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion"", with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude.",464ce9f19f59ef96fdb3bec1a8eb5dbc,What is the name of the person in whose output there are few leading notes?,Ravel,Ravel's,bert,d61f94b0f2c052f32ee8c2ba037d712d,What is the name of the person in whose output there are few leading notes?,Ravel,works.Ravel,bert,fe23da82c81d18287ade93e66e6e794d,What is the name of the person who considers himself a classicist in may ways?,Ravel,Ravel's,bert,0568a211cabcf15b7611f4cfce17f42a,What is the name of the person who considers himself a classicist in may ways?,Ravel,works.Ravel,bert,f70aef9d3b3b97df9866a275b8bb685f,What is the name of the person who wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired?,Ravel,l,bert,9ec09e65ba63bdfba131360a280cd75b,What is the name of the person whose themes are frequently modal?,Ravel,Ravel's,bert,e59fa7f057d011705c03ca7209834615,What is the name of the person whose themes are frequently modal?,Ravel,works.Ravel,bert,99348e69b27158de058a55aae9e37609,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Mark Hunter, a high school student in a sleepy suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, starts an FM pirate radio station that broadcasts from the basement of his parents' house. Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. His pirate station's theme song is ""Everybody Knows"" by Leonard Cohen and there are glimpses of cassettes by such alternative musicians as The Jesus and Mary Chain, Camper Van Beethoven, Primal Scream, Soundgarden, Ice-T, Bad Brains, Concrete Blonde, Henry Rollins, and The Pixies.  By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him; by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show. Nobody knows the true identity of ""Hard Harry"" or ""Happy Harry Hard-on,"" as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro, a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicide—at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an overachieving student named Paige Woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on.  She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release.",b787d94080543517e726001ba62a3fcb,What is the full name of the person that a student tracks down the day after a suicide occurs?,Mark Hunter,"""Happy Harry Hard-on,"" as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro,",bert,2c291a409fdda9eb1dcdbcb5e2ca1738,What is the full name of the person that a student tracks down the day after a suicide occurs?,Mark Hunter,"""Hard Harry"" or ""Happy Harry Hard-on,"" as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro,",bert,8cd9896dc203526878d7aa83af19d195,What is the full name of the person that a student tracks down the day after a suicide occurs?,Mark Hunter,"Hunter,",bert,cf7d564d7c08c6386684682193d09ed4,What is the full name of the person that a student tracks down the day after a suicide occurs?,Mark Hunter,"Nora Diniro,",bert,e9f518a538f07b0c64bfc099281d8b2d,What is the full name of the person that a student tracks down the day after a suicide occurs?,Mark Hunter,Paige Woodward,bert,bc5877cd892cf63c3b39f8bf3bbacffb,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Marojejy National Park is located in the northeast of Madagascar between the towns of Andapa and Sambava and extends approximately 32 km (20 mi) from east to west and 22 km (14 mi) from north to south.  It is centered on the chain of mountains known as Marojejy Massif.  Despite a scientific survey of some of the other mountains in the region by the 1929 Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Américaine, Marojejy was not surveyed until 1937 when L.-J. Arragon of the Service Géographique de Madagascar ascended Marojejy Est. Arragon did not conduct any field research during his visit.  The massif was not geologically described until after the French botanist Jean-Henri Humbert from the National Museum of Natural History in Paris explored the mountains in 1948.  Humbert had previously explored numerous mountain ranges in continental Africa before going to Marojejy. Between November 1948 and November 1950, he spent five months collecting 4,039 dried plant (herbarium) specimens for study.  After several expeditions, he published the book ""A Marvel of Nature"" in 1955, in which he claimed the massif was the most impressive range in all of Madagascar because of its size, floral diversity, and pristine natural state.Marojejy was set aside as one of Madagascar's strict nature reserves in 1952 largely due to Humbert's enthusiasm and support.  Under this protection, only research scientists were permitted to visit the site.  In 1998, Marojejy was converted into a national park and thus became open to visitors.Originally seen as a transition zone between the eastern rainforests and the central highlands, Marojejy is now recognized as having its own unique features, with some of the richest biodiversity on the island.  Several studies from the early 1970s through the 1990s surveyed the mountain ecosystems and inventoried the flora and fauna.  In 2007, Marojejy was listed as a World Heritage Site as part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana.

"Mary Ann has been tormented her whole life by dreams of a sinister figure called the Red King and his morbid fairytale kingdom. Following the death of her father, she returns to her family home where she recalls the childhood stories of the Red King and Alice from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that her father once read to her. Within the decaying and neglected state of the gothic family house, Mary Ann soon discovers that her once highly religious and abusive mother is now secretly engaging in black magic. A brutal bewitching attack from her mother propels Mary Ann into the twisted, fairy tale dream world of the Red King. In this dream world Mary Ann encounters an unlikely guide in the form of a mysterious, Cheshire Cat masked little girl calling herself Alice. Alice prompts Mary Ann to question the relevancy of the dreamscape and whether this is Mary Ann's dream or that of the Red King's. Haunting events and emergence of suppressed memories force Mary Ann to unlock secrets of her painful childhood as she journeys through the realms of the dream world, landing in a final confrontation with the Red King. Mary Ann must face this embodiment of her childhood fears to forever gain closure to the pains and horrors of her past.",2e407d9709804de0aaacd2e1c4be547c,What does the morbid fairytale kingdom represent?,childhood fears,Alice.,bert,3aaf6f061f8aca3d2a96659c6dec815d,What does the morbid fairytale kingdom represent?,childhood fears,Red King,bert,7f32f0b6c88600b28042eaca45c6308e,What does the morbid fairytale kingdom represent?,childhood fears,a sinister figure called the Red King,bert,da4acfdad0b067dfb974d33c585b524a,What is the full name of the person whose father died?,Mary Ann,Mary Ann has been tormented her whole life by dreams of a sinister figure called the Red King,bert,b0b0ab6772c05830dc9e6c6f9ea1d7fe,What is the full name of the person whose father died?,Mary Ann,Red King,bert,3c945bb22e3e5259e245e551674ad302,Who torments the daughter of the woman practicing black magic?,the Red King,Alice,bert,aec57cc80ca700aa4d1115bce0a43851,Who torments the daughter of the woman practicing black magic?,the Red King,Alice.

"Max Anderson is being pursued by a Tyrannosaurus until a fissure vent opens in the ground. When he tries to jump across, he calls out his brother's name before falling into the vent. Ten years later, Max's 13-year-old son, Sean Anderson, visits Max's brother, volcanologist Trevor Anderson. In a box of items that belonged to Max is a book, Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. Notes written by Max are found inside the book. In Trevor's volcanology laboratory, a device shows activity on Snæfell, a dormant volcano in Iceland. Trevor and Sean travel to Iceland to investigate. They try to contact Icelandic volcanologist Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, but instead encounter his daughter Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir since her father had died some years earlier. It turns out that Sigurbjörn and Max were both Vernians, a group of people who believe the works of Jules Verne to be fact and not fiction. Hannah offers to help them climb the volcano. While the group is hiking up the volcano, a lightning storm forces them to take shelter in a cave. The cave entrance collapses, trapping them in what appears to be an abandoned mine. The trio rappel down a giant hole and ride on out-of-control mine carts, in which the tracks start to branch off in three ways. Hannah and Trevor save each other from dead-ends and Sean reunites with them. They reach the bottom of a volcanic vent filled with different varieties of crystals, including Diamonds. Sean accidentally drops a diamond, which breaks the Muscovite floor, and they begin to fall towards the center of the Earth. The vent eventually becomes a water slide which drops them safely into a lake in the center of the Earth, which turns out to be a completely separate world contained within the Earth.",b43000a67caa4f3b64d998911764f9f0,What are the full names of the people who rappel down a hole in the mine?,Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir,Jules Verne.,bert,36b00585389161835107f6cfcfbe0136,What are the full names of the people who rappel down a hole in the mine?,Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir,Max Anderson,bert,cc07f0af8ed2dc1f5d218f18e359212d,What are the full names of the people who rappel down a hole in the mine?,Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir,"Sean Anderson,",bert,371f0765f7e9141ff6f411eab11c0a13,What are the full names of the people who rappel down a hole in the mine?,Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir,"Sean Anderson, visits Max's brother, volcanologist Trevor Anderson.",bert,508c9226fa256ea6355c26743490a923,What are the full names of the people who rappel down a hole in the mine?,Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir,"Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, but instead encounter his daughter Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir",bert,d21bc89c36b0a45f74f9d0cde827f9bb,What are the full names of the people who rappel down a hole in the mine?,Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir,"Trevor Anderson.

"Melanie Daniels, a young socialite, meets criminal defense attorney Mitch Brenner in a San Francisco pet shop. Mitch wants to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his sister's eleventh birthday, but the shop has none. He recognizes Melanie from a court appearance, but she does not know him; he plays a prank by pretending to mistake her for a saleswoman. Melanie is infuriated by the prank—but finds herself romantically intrigued by Mitch. Melanie purchases a pair of lovebirds and drives to Mitch's weekend address in Bodega Bay to deliver them. Wanting to surprise him, she rents a motorboat so she can approach the Brenner house from the bay instead of the road. She sneaks the birds inside the house and heads back across the bay. Mitch discovers the birds, spots Melanie's boat during her retreat, and drives around the bay to meet her. Melanie is attacked and injured by a seagull near shore on the town side.

"Mesopropithecus is a genus within the sloth lemur family (Palaeopropithecidae), which includes three other genera: Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Babakotia. This family in turn belongs to the infraorder Lemuriformes, which includes all the Malagasy lemurs.Mesopropithecus was named in 1905 by Herbert F. Standing using four skulls found at Ampasambazimba. He noted that the animal had characteristics of both Palaeopropithecus and the living sifakas (Propithecus). In 1936, Charles Lamberton defined Neopropithecus globiceps (based on one skull from Tsirave) and N. platyfrons (based on two skulls from Anavoha).  He thought that Neopropithecus was a separate, intermediate genus between Mesopropithecus and Propithecus.  In 1971, paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall merged N. platyfrons into N. globiceps and Neopropithecus into Mesopropithecus.Until 1986, Mesopropithecus was only known from cranial (skull) remains from central and southern Madagascar, and because these are similar to teeth and skulls of living indriids, particularly those of Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi), Mesopropithecus was often assigned to the family Indriidae.  For example, in 1974, Tattersall and Schwartz labeled Mesopropithecus as a sister group to sifakas.  With the discovery of an associated skeleton of M. dolichobrachion near Ankarana in 1986, it became clear that Mesopropithecus shared distinct traits with sloth lemurs.  Unlike the indriids, but like the sloth lemurs, they had elongated forelimbs and other adaptations for arboreal suspension (hanging in trees), linking them most closely to family Paleaeopropithecidae.  A comparison of these morphological traits between the sloth lemurs and indriids suggest that Mesopropithecus was the first genus to diverge within the sloth lemur family.",57dbdca4e6cb1fdd122422eac50e8770,What group shares elongated forelimbs with Mesopropithecus?,sloth lemurs,indriids,bert,26c8ed6d137895554ec238b1df9d3f90,What is the last name of the person that defined the groups merged by a 1971 paleoanthropologist?,Lamberton,all,bert,f88c15f65f81dc130766eb4e994544f5,What is the last name of the person that defined the groups merged by a 1971 paleoanthropologist?,Lamberton,on,bert,2bb70bb80f5a67a699860c267e4f2fc4,What is the last name of the person that defined the groups merged by a 1971 paleoanthropologist?,Lamberton,tters,bert,99f704ee8bcc03df0b799b501000a34c,What was labeled as a sister group in 1974?,Mesopropithecus,Mesopropithecus as a sister group to sifakas.,bert,d2013e99ecc06eb9f43ddd9a7e988207,What was labeled as a sister group in 1974?,Mesopropithecus,sifakas,bert,f147fdb9709c673ab6671a189af89215,Where was the skeleton that linked Mesopropithecus to sloth lemurs discovered?,Ankarana,"Ankarana in 1986,",bert,48d5dfa1c75ee8ac67aa09fcb700946e,Where was the skeleton that linked Mesopropithecus to sloth lemurs discovered?,Ankarana,na,bert,c6c7dd108039468db3864b55f453673c,Where was the skeleton that linked Mesopropithecus to sloth lemurs discovered?,Ankarana,near Ankarana,bert,0896bf03886fdac9371e0fac989e847a,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Mineralogist Paul Carlson is struck by a lunar meteorite while observing a meteor shower.  Lodged in his brain, the meteorite causes him to transform into a strong and vicious lizard (the titular ""moon beast"") whenever the moon comes out. In his lizard form, Paul loses all traces of his human self and goes about killing people at random. While human, Paul is subject to spells of dizziness and nausea, causing his girlfriend Kathy Nolan and friend and former teacher Johnny Longbow to become concerned. Eventually it is shown that Paul is the monster, and deduced that the meteorite fragment in his brain is the cause of his transformations. Plans are made to remove it from his skull, but the NASA brain surgeons realize, after another X-ray and Johnny remembering some Native American legends documenting similar phenomena, that the meteorite has disintegrated and will eventually cause Paul to self-combust.

"Mineralogist Paul Carlson is struck by a lunar meteorite while observing a meteor shower.  Lodged in his brain, the meteorite causes him to transform into a strong and vicious lizard (the titular ""moon beast"") whenever the moon comes out. In his lizard form, Paul loses all traces of his human self and goes about killing people at random. While human, Paul is subject to spells of dizziness and nausea, causing his girlfriend Kathy Nolan and friend and former teacher Johnny Longbow to become concerned. Eventually it is shown that Paul is the monster, and deduced that the meteorite fragment in his brain is the cause of his transformations. Plans are made to remove it from his skull, but the NASA brain surgeons realize, after another X-ray and Johnny remembering some Native American legends documenting similar phenomena, that the meteorite has disintegrated and will eventually cause Paul to self-combust.

"Minerva and Telemaco return to Ithaca in a chariot. Telemaco is greeted joyfully by Eumete and the disguised Ulisse in the woodland grove: ""O great son of Ulysses, you have indeed returned!"" After Eumete goes to inform Penelope of Telemaco's arrival a bolt of fire descends on Ulisse, removing his disguise and revealing his true identity to his son. The two celebrate their reunion before Ulisse sends Telemaco to the palace, promising to follow shortly. In the palace, Melanto complains to Eurimaco that Penelope still refuses to choose a suitor: ""In short, Eurymachus, the lady has a heart of stone."" Soon afterwards Penelope receives the three suitors (Antinoo, Pisandro, Anfinomo), and rejects each in turn despite their efforts to enliven the court with singing and dancing: ""Now to enjoyment, to dance and song!"" After the suitors' departure Eumete tells Penelope that Telemaco has arrived in Ithaca, but she is doubtful: ""Such uncertain things redouble my grief."" Eumete's message is overheard by the suitors, who plot to kill Telemaco. However, they are unnerved when a symbolic eagle flies overhead, so they abandon their plan and renew their efforts to capture Penelope's heart, this time with gold. Back in the woodland grove, Minerva tells Ulisse that she has organised a means whereby he will be able to challenge and destroy the suitors. Resuming his beggar's disguise, Ulisse arrives at the palace, where he is challenged to a fight by Iro, (""I will pluck out the hairs of your beard one by one!""), a challenge he accepts and wins. Penelope now states that she will accept the suitor who is able to string Ulisse's bow. All three suitors attempt the task unsuccessfully. The disguised Ulisse then asks to try though renouncing the prize of Penelope's hand, and to everyone's amazement he succeeds. He then angrily denounces the suitors and, summoning the names of the gods, kills all three with the bow: ""This is how the bow wounds!

"Minnesota ""Doc"" West is sending money (each bill marked with an ""E"") to a  boarding school in Boston in a post office at Santa Fe, New Mexico. After leaving the post  office he is robbed by two bandits who take everything, including his money. He rides after them on his horse, but is stopped when he sees a boy named Silver fall  off his horse spooked by a rattlesnake. West shoots the rattlesnake's rattler off and it  retreats into the bushes.  Silver's arm is dislocated, but West fixes it. Silver asks him if  he's a doctor, but West declines. Silver tells West that the bandits headed for Holysand, the nearest town. When they arrive  in Holysand, they discover a fire in the middle of town set by Silver's stepfather and rancher, Nathan Mitchell. Nathan argues with a rival rancher, Victor Baker about burning the bags of seed that Nathan bought. The argument is broken up by Sheriff Roy Basehart and the local school teacher Denise Stark. Nathan's ranch hand, Garvey orders Silver to clean it up. West walks into the saloon turning everyone's head, because he is new. Instead of ordering  whiskey he orders tea, causing everyone to ridicule him. Garvey offers him a seat and a round  of poker. West wins a hand, but Garvey accuses him of cheating. The sheriff arrests West and  locks him up and Garvey keeps West's money. Later that night Silver tells people about how West  fixed his arm. When the sheriff tells West about his back pain, he suggests getting new boots.

"New York City bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga is searching for new employment while the Copacabana nightclub, where he works, is closed for renovations. He is invited to an interview with Doctor Don Shirley, an eccentric African American pianist who is looking for a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South. Don hires Tony on the strength of his references. They embark with plans to return to New York on Christmas Eve. Don's record label gives Tony a copy of the Green Book, a guide for African-American travelers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve them.They begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading farther south. Tony and Don initially clash as  Don is disgusted by Tony's habits while Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act with more refinement. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, and increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment that Don receives from his hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. A group of white men threatens Don's life in a bar and Tony rescues him.

"Newcastle-born gangster Jack Carter has lived in London for years in the employ of organised crime bosses Gerald and Sid Fletcher (Terence Rigby and John Bindon). Jack is sleeping with Gerald's girlfriend Anna and plans to escape with her to South America, but he must first return to Newcastle and Gateshead to attend the funeral of his brother, Frank, who died in a purported drunk-driving accident. Unsatisfied with the official explanation, Jack investigates for himself. At the funeral Jack meets his teenage niece Doreen and Frank's evasive mistress Margaret; it is later implied that Doreen is Jack's daughter. Jack goes to Newcastle Racecourse seeking old acquaintance Albert Swift for information about his brother's death, however Swift spots Jack and evades him. Jack encounters another old associate, Eric Paice, who refuses to tell Jack who is employing him as a chauffeur. Tailing Eric leads him to the country house of crime boss Cyril Kinnear. Jack bursts in on Kinnear, who is playing poker, but learns little from him; he also meets a glamorous drunken woman, Glenda. As Jack leaves, Eric warns him against damaging relations between Kinnear and the Fletchers. Back in town, Jack is threatened by henchmen who want him to leave town, but he fights them off, capturing and interrogating one to find out who wants him gone.

"Novelists and writers have captured much of the color and challenge in their immigrant lives through their writings.Regarding Irish women in the 19th century, there were numerous novels and short stories by Harvey O'Higgins, Peter McCorry, Bernard O'Reilly and Sarah Orne Jewett that emphasize emancipation from Old World controls, new opportunities and expansiveness of the immigrant experience.On the other hand, Hladnik studies three popular novels of the late 19th century that warned Slovenes not to immigrate to the dangerous new world of the United States.Jewish American writer Anzia Yezierska wrote her novel Bread Givers (1925) to explore such themes as Russian-Jewish immigration in the early 20th century, the tension between Old and New World Yiddish culture, and women's experience of immigration. A well established author Yezierska focused on the Jewish struggle to escape the ghetto and enter middle- and upper-class America. In the novel, the heroine, Sara Smolinsky, escape from New York City's ""down-town ghetto"" by breaking tradition.

Finally Sara restores her broken links to family and religion.The Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg in the mid-20th century wrote a series of four novels describing one Swedish family's migration from Småland to Minnesota in the late 19th century, a destiny shared by almost one million people.

"Nurse Laura Mattson and World War I military pilot Lt. Geoffrey Aiken fall in love after only knowing each other for a few days. Tragically, he is brought to her hospital and, by chance, put under her care after being fatally wounded on his very first mission. After he dies, Laura realizes she is pregnant. Edward Seward loves her and persuades her to marry him. As far as anyone knows, the child will be his. By 1940, Laura's son Bob has grown into a young man, newly engaged to Peggy Chase. Laura has raised Bob to embrace pacifism. Meanwhile, Edward Seward, now United States Secretary of State, flies home after having negotiated the Seward Peace Treaty, which he claims will make it impossible for any country to go to war again. However, when the U.S. ambassador to the state of ""Eurasia"" is assassinated while en route to the Eurasian State Department to discuss an earlier diplomatic incident, the President sends the navy across the Atlantic to underscore the U.S. demand for a formal apology. Eurasia refuses to comply, and another world war becomes inevitable despite the treaty. Laura speaks at a large peace rally, over her husband's strong objection. The rally is broken up a group of angry men. A mob then gathers at the Seward home and starts pelting the place. Edward manages to disperse the crowd by first reminding the mob of each American's right to voice his or her own opinion in peacetime, and pledging himself wholeheartedly to the struggle once war is declared. When a news reporter interviews him, he insists his son will enlist. Bob categorically denies this, causing Peggy to break off their engagement. Unable to get his son to change his mind, Edward tells him that he at least has no right to sully the Seward name, revealing that he is not Bob's father. Laura confirms it, and tells Bob of his real father and how he died.",a7c097e31eec0b85dbfe6de513005840,What country was demanding a formal apology?,U.S,"""Eurasia""",bert,a413ca5d9667dbc5ac2bb1b941a8a01a,What country was demanding a formal apology?,U.S,"Eurasian State Department to discuss an earlier diplomatic incident, the President sends the navy across the Atlantic to underscore the U.S.",bert,dcb160a7cd8d6cfe228dde4052e59620,What country was demanding a formal apology?,U.S,U.S. ambassador to the state,bert,ceb7986ab06033525cc462e0bfd4aac7,What country was demanding a formal apology?,U.S,"U.S. ambassador to the state of ""Eurasia""",bert,1471120ce9cd5bb83e209fce70dba3e1,What is the full name of the person that did not want Laura to speak at the peace rally?,Edward Seward,Geoffrey Aiken,bert,b62b05686d54d80f6040e317f9dadfbe,What is the full name of the person that did not want Laura to speak at the peace rally?,Edward Seward,Lt.

"Okereke has discussed a natural progression in Bloc Party's compositional style to a more explorative, electronic direction. For the opening track on Intimacy, ""Ares"", Okereke was inspired to rap his lyrics after listening to the old-school hip hop of Afrika Bambaataa. According to Heather Phares of AllMusic, the song includes siren-like guitar chords and loud, complex drumming in the vein of dance acts The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. ""Mercury"" continues the complex drumming theme by incorporating layered percussion and contains a vocally manipulated chorus. The track is an attempt at drum and bass and features brass dissonance, effects Okereke has called ""harsh, glacial, layered and energetic"". ""Zephyrus"" begins with a solitary vocal line accompanied only by a drum machine pattern, while the Exmoor Singers provide background vocals in the rest of the composition. ""Signs"" is the only song that does not include guitars; instead, it is made up of a synthesiser pulse and multitracked samples of glockenspiel and mbira resembling the work of minimalist composer Steve Reich.Okereke has conceded that Intimacy covers Bloc Party's typical indie rock elements, but noted that the guitars have an artificial and manipulated sound, ""almost like all the humanity has been bleached out"". ""Halo"" has a fast tempo coupled with a guitar melody that uses only four chords, while ""Trojan Horse"" features syncopated guitars and distortion. ""Talons"" also incorporates distortion from both lead and rhythm guitars, while the final single ""One Month Off"" consists of tribal rhythms and sixteenth note guitar riffs. ""Biko"" has a slower tempo and includes guitar arpeggi throughout, while ""Ion Square"" incorporates guitar overdubbing and the use of hi-hat patterns throughout. According to Nick Southall of Drowned in Sound, ""Better Than Heaven"" encapsulates what Bloc Party had been trying to achieve in their previous works, ""namely aligning all their different directional desires: to swoon, to rock, and to experiment all at once"".

"On Christmas Eve in 19th-century London, Fred is sliding on ice on a sidewalk. He meets Peter and Tim Cratchit, sons of his uncle Ebenezer's clerk, Bob Cratchit. When Fred reveals who he is, the boys take off in terror. Fred soon arrives at the counting-house of his miserly maternal uncle, Ebenezer Scrooge. After declining an invitation from his nephew to dine with him on Christmas, Scrooge rejects two gentlemen collecting money for charity. That night, Scrooge reluctantly allows his employee Bob Cratchit to have Christmas off with pay but orders him back all the earlier the day after. Later Bob accidentally knocks off Scrooge's hat with a snowball. Scrooge dismisses Bob and withholds a week's pay to compensate for his ruined hat, also demanding a shilling to make up the difference. Bob spends the last of his wages on food for his family's Christmas dinner.  In his house, Scrooge is confronted by the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns Scrooge to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife as Marley was. He tells Scrooge he will be haunted by three spirits. At one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the youthful Ghost of Christmas Past, who takes him back in time to his early life. Scrooge is shown his unhappiness when he was left to spend the holidays alone at school, and his joy when his sister, Fran, came to take him home for Christmas. The spirit reminds Scrooge that Fran, dead for some years, is the mother of his nephew.

"On July 13, 1787, the Second Continental Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, creating the Northwest Territory which included Michigan. In 1805, the U.S. Congress created the Michigan Territory, with Detroit as its territorial capital. Michigan first applied for statehood as early as 1832, though it was rebuffed due to a dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip, a 468-square mile (1,210 km²) area that included the important port city of Toledo. By 1835, Michigan had formed a state government without receiving authorization from Congress to do so. The state's boundaries included the contested area. The dispute culminated in what has become known as the Toledo War, as Michigan and Ohio militia took up arms in the area. As a condition for entering the Union, Michigan was forced to accept the eastern three-quarters of the Upper Peninsula in exchange for ceding its claim to the Toledo Strip. After a state convention first rejected this condition, a second convention, assembled under some duress in December 1836, reluctantly accepted the terms and Michigan became the 26th state on January 26, 1837, with Detroit as its first capital. The first building to serve as the State Capitol was built in 1832 as the Territorial Courthouse. The court house was on the corner of Griswold Street and State Street. This brick structure was one of Michigan's earliest Greek revival buildings, with a portico of Ionic columns and a central tower of 140 feet (42 m). Built at a cost of $24,500 ($610,000 in 2019), the building housed the territorial government and state legislatures until 1848, when a hastily erected wood building was constructed in Lansing following a decision made March 17, 1847, to move the capital from Detroit to Lansing. The Detroit building then became a public school (the Union School, at one time the city's only high school) and library until it burned in 1893.",fd6c1e3cc49be368269836ba0913081b,What state was a hastily erected wood building constructed in?,Michigan,Lansing,bert,99f217fd2917171b46ac6b52550d64fc,What state was a hastily erected wood building constructed in?,Michigan,"Lansing following a decision made March 17, 1847, to move the capital from Detroit to Lansing.",bert,673b4df2f3f5011cd616407d2bb32bbc,What state's capital was formerly Detroit?,Michigan,"Michigan Territory, with Detroit as its territorial capital.

"On New Year's Eve 1938, lawyer Billy Cooper notices stranded English showgirl Jennie Carr gazing hungrily at other diners' plates and offers to buy her a meal. However, the restaurant is all out of food, so he invites her to his apartment. Before they arrive, Abel, another equally hungry and unemployed person, sneaks in for a chicken leg. Hearing them coming, he hides in a bedroom. When Jennie enters the room to remove her coat, he begs her not to cause trouble. She sympathizes with his plight and says nothing to Billy. Just then, Hugo Brant, Billy's gangster employer, and his men barge in. They make Jennie leave. When Billy admits that he is quitting, Brant shoots him dead. To get rid of loose ends, Hugo sends Harrigan aboard the ocean liner bound for Southampton with Jennie. He frames Jennie for robbery.

"On his release, Tippett returned to his duties at Morley, where he boosted the college's Purcell tradition by persuading Alfred Deller, the countertenor, to sing several Purcell odes at a  concert on 21 October 1944—the first modern use of a countertenor  in Purcell's music. Tippett formed a fruitful musical friendship with Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears, for whom he wrote the cantata Boyhood's End for tenor and piano. Encouraged by Britten, Tippett made arrangements for the first performance of A Child of Our Time, at London's Adelphi Theatre on 19 March 1944. Goehr conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Morley's choral forces were augmented by the London Regional Civil Defence Choir. Pears sang the tenor solo part, and other soloists were borrowed from Sadler's Wells Opera. The work was well received by critics and the public, and eventually became one of the most frequently performed large-scale choral works of the post-Second World War period, in Britain and overseas. Tippett's immediate reward was a commission from the BBC for a motet, The Weeping Babe, which became his first broadcast work when it was aired on 24 December 1944. He also began to give regular radio talks on music.In 1946 Tippett organised at Morley the first British performance of Monteverdi's Vespers, adding his own organ Preludio for the occasion. Tippett's compositions in the immediate postwar years included his  First Symphony, performed under Sargent in November 1945, and the String Quartet No. 3, premiered in October 1946 by the Zorian Quartet. His main creative energies were increasingly devoted to his first major opera, The Midsummer Marriage. During the six years from 1946 he composed almost no other music, apart from the Birthday Suite for Prince Charles (1948).",2f25bd29e92cfe19e44c164215a8e919,What is the name of the person who began to give regular radio talks on music?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,744ed3b5b51357998c1578f03a6ce425,What is the name of the person who boosted the college's Purcell tradition by persuading the countertenor to sing several Purcell odes at a concert on 21 October 1944?,Tippett,"Alfred Deller,",bert,781537e72e5b973eb97a123522322986,What is the name of the person who boosted the college's Purcell tradition by persuading the countertenor to sing several Purcell odes at a concert on 21 October 1944?,Tippett,"Tippett returned to his duties at Morley, where he boosted the college's Purcell tradition by persuading Alfred Deller,",bert,8a5e84f6408445ec6c7d1472f9cd5cab,What is the name of the person who boosted the college's Purcell tradition by persuading the countertenor to sing several Purcell odes at a concert on 21 October 1944?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,ec59ac0149de3666ef6282d9444b7461,What is the name of the person who boosted the college's Purcell tradition by persuading the countertenor to sing several Purcell odes at a concert on 21 October 1944?,Tippett,t,bert,9bc0d5ea416e96e9f9fdbb3fac24b7d2,What is the name of the person who wrote the cantata Boyhood's End for tenor and piano?,Tippett,Purcell's music.

During the six years from 1946 he composed almost no other music, apart from the Birthday Suite for Prince Charles (1948).",be46d4791e236f4a64d75962399f0cb7,What is the name of the person whose first major opera was The Midsummer Marriage?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,20c49ca30f4df362381779640f99529c,What is the name of the person whose first major opera was The Midsummer Marriage?,Tippett,pett,bert,4605486285a47ec8e61c6708537565a1,What is the name of the person whose first major opera was The Midsummer Marriage?,Tippett,t,bert,f91600624cb042bea0c82473fc5050ac,What is the name of the person whose first major opera was The Midsummer Marriage?,Tippett,t's,bert,0a3a039ed1936ab3370f3dbfb2e5b162,"What is the name of the person whose main creative energies were increasingly devoted to his first major opera, The Midsummer Marriage?",Tippett,Tippett's,bert,adfdd2412d3fa0db4dbdfa14ab9ce4e3,"What is the name of the person whose main creative energies were increasingly devoted to his first major opera, The Midsummer Marriage?",Tippett,pett,bert,61ac5a998cc72a07081a81ea57735a5e,"What is the name of the person whose main creative energies were increasingly devoted to his first major opera, The Midsummer Marriage?",Tippett,t,bert,92e5ebbef55d9e2e77da196d52fc13aa,"What is the name of the person whose main creative energies were increasingly devoted to his first major opera, The Midsummer Marriage?",Tippett,t's,bert,8a6fdfb9302977a3e4445027d937ef05,What is the name of the person whose own organ Preludio was added to the first British performance of Monteverdi's Vespers?,Tippett,Morley,bert,e780d0db5ba8aa0e42605a95e5e02664,What is the name of the person whose own organ Preludio was added to the first British performance of Monteverdi's Vespers?,Tippett,"Morley the first British performance of Monteverdi's Vespers, adding his own organ Preludio for the occasion.

"On the eve of the first day of school, Brady and McKenzie celebrate the day they met and reminisce about the summer, while they watch Brady's favorite movie, Wet Side Story, the 1960s musical film that they got stuck in during the events of Teen Beach Movie. Mack dismisses Brady's fear that their relationship will change when they begin school. Mack then notices she lost the necklace she received while in Wet Side Story's universe. At school, Brady and Mack reunite with their respective friends, Devon and Alyssa, who are surprised by their new relationship due to their opposite personalities. Brady and Mack are surprised by how differently they act at school. Later, in class, Brady is working on surfboard designs, but hides them when Mack asks him what he is doing. Brady becomes defensive when Mack meets a handsome boy named Spencer Watkins. Mack works on a ""Save The Beach"" dance, despite Brady's attempts to see her. Struggling with a college application, Brady works on a surfboard instead and accidentally forgets about a college fair that he was to attend with Mack, upsetting her to the point that they break up. In the Wet Side Story universe, Lela and Tanner notice Mack's washed-up necklace and journey into the ocean, winding up on the same beach as Mack and Brady, who are still mad at each other. Mack and Brady tell Lela and Tanner that they are in the future, exciting them. Mack and Brady do not tell them they are film characters, choosing instead to show them that the real world is not as great as it seems, in hopes that they will return to their own world. Meanwhile, the characters in Wet Side Story are confused without Lela and Tanner.",b2c791cd6ba6a5fe17b8f9936ef7a921,What are the names of the characters who are said to have opposite personalities?,Brady,"Brady and Mack reunite with their respective friends, Devon",bert,5330f456dad3d9af48200924266ce360,What are the names of the characters who are said to have opposite personalities?,Brady,"Brady and Mack reunite with their respective friends, Devon and Alyssa, who are surprised by their new relationship due to their opposite personalities.

"One day, Molly Standing is picking apples in her father's apple orchard in California, with her friend Gertie, when they meet two boys, Tommy Melville and Gus Schultz. Molly falls in love with Tommy while Gertie falls in love with Gus. They plan a double wedding. Gerald Winters and his mother, who are wealthy art patrons, hear Molly singing, and, at Gerald's suggestion, since he is very attracted to her, they sponsor her to study in Italy.

"Oswald and a big beagle are at a cinema watching a documentary. The documentary tells about explorers who travel place to place in their hot air balloons. Oswald is amazed by the adventures of the explorers, and therefore decides become an explorer too. One day at a fairground, a large crowd gathers to see Oswald take off in his balloon. The balloon is a large hot water bottle and the carriage is a metal stove (with switches inside). Oswald invites the big beagle, who is in the crowd, to join him. The big beagle, at first, declines the invitation before he shakes hands with his little friend, and releases the balloon. But as the balloon rises and one of its anchors snags away his pants, the big beagle changes his mind. He would spend the entire ride on the anchor. Oswald's balloon rapidly ascend into the heavens. They go so fast and so high that they even reach space. Their voyage ends when they land on the planet Mars. Unfortunately for them, their balloon is wreck, and the two are left wondering if they would ever get back. They begin walking on the rocky Martian surface. On the way, they see a giant sipping soup and gobbling explosives. Because of the giant's hostile nature, Oswald and the big beagle try to flee, only to unknowingly run into the bore of a huge cannon. The cannon shoots them airborne and they land in the giant's soup bowl. The giant is surprised to see the two visitors in his bowl. Nevertheless, he becomes obliged to gobble them as he scoops up Oswald and the big beagle with his spoon. Suddenly the giant decides to delay eating his victims. He then puts Oswald and the big beagle in a large salt shaker and then chooses to have some music played by walking guns.",a00fa2ea0a41eefd83c6680829644df4,Where did Oswald and a big beagle land when they were shot out of a canon?,giant's soup bowl,Mars.,bert,96784b1225cbf64f9939004ca80084aa,Where did Oswald and a big beagle land when they were shot out of a canon?,giant's soup bowl,in the giant's soup bowl,bert,55fe511f5da873ffecb6400734bce5f7,Where did Oswald and a big beagle land when they were shot out of a canon?,giant's soup bowl,planet Mars.,bert,a9d6f57c22f03b7963b73d23ea592fe3,Where did Oswald and a big beagle land when they were shot out of a canon?,giant's soup bowl,the giant,bert,452803d17c4195f3069384e9aabbd472,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Overall, reception of the album was positive. Stephen Holden of Blender called Wainwright's tribute ""a fabulous stunt in which a gay singer channeled the spirit of the ultimate gay icon"", and declared the album was ""as good an introduction to the great American songbook as any"". Pitchfork Media's Stephen Troussé wrote that Wainwright ""elegantly outdoes [Garland] on a couple of the ballads"" and also compliments guest performer Martha Wainwright, ""who turns in a stunning, showstopping 'Stormy Weather' in an appropriately brazen bid to steal the show"".

"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah, was a flautist and composer of traditional music of the central highlands of Madagascar. Born in 1923 near the capital city of Antananarivo to a poor rural family, Rakoto Frah surmounted the challenges posed by his underprivileged origins to become the most acclaimed 20th century performer of the sodina flute, one of the oldest traditional instruments on the island. Through frequent international concerts and music festival performances, he promoted the music of the highlands of Madagascar and became one of the most famous Malagasy artists, both within Madagascar and on the world music scene. After gaining regional recognition for his sodina skills as a youth, Rakoto Frah rose to national fame in 1958 when he was selected by Malagasy President Philibert Tsiranana to perform on the sodina for the visiting French president Charles de Gaulle. This event launched his career as a professional musician.  He first played at traditional ceremonies around the country, then expanded his performances from 1967 to include participation in international music competitions and festivals. His popularity declined in the 1970s but underwent a revival that began in the mid-1980s and continued until his death in 2001. During this period Rakoto Frah recorded ten albums, toured extensively in Madagascar and overseas, was featured in two French documentaries, and collaborated with a variety of international and Malagasy artists. Over the course of his career he recorded over 800 original compositions. Rakoto Frah and his sodina were depicted on the 200 ariary Malagasy banknote in honor of his key role in revitalizing and internationally popularizing the sodina. Despite the artist's worldwide acclaim, he lived simply and died having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship. His death was widely mourned and marked by a state funeral, and in 2011 a famadihana (the Malagasy highland ""turning of the bones"" funerary tradition) was organized to celebrate the artist's life.",a9503e3b07d7436c2e064061ce023fd5,What is the common name of the person who became one of the most famous Malagasy artists?,Rakoto Frah,Philibert Rabezoza,bert,8c4053dff89d57b0f4f939889f93269a,What is the common name of the person who became one of the most famous Malagasy artists?,Rakoto Frah,"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah,",bert,7d638b75750a3a805d634d73866de18e,What is the common name of the person who died having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship?,Rakoto Frah,Frah,bert,e65881a248b99add0c8714c0c34c0f29,What is the common name of the person who died having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship?,Rakoto Frah,Philibert Rabezoza,bert,e6331598e84c5ca1aa445cb4484c7ed9,What is the common name of the person who died having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship?,Rakoto Frah,"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah,",bert,aeaf81426a5aaee6c7042b5fdbfe0380,What is the common name of the person who died having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship?,Rakoto Frah,Rakoto,bert,068570bb86634e10d643f935f185ffeb,What is the common name of the person who died in 2001?,Rakoto Frah,Frah,bert,a1456461b396f97ba4a56192eaa92c48,What is the common name of the person who died in 2001?,Rakoto Frah,Philibert Rabezoza,bert,6f433a8302745f284361655113b1a47f,What is the common name of the person who died in 2001?,Rakoto Frah,"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah,",bert,349a35947e0b67befadb36d024a6dfd2,What is the common name of the person who first played at traditional ceremonies around the country?,Rakoto Frah,Philibert,bert,08470367022a587022e1c1d4618cd065,What is the common name of the person who first played at traditional ceremonies around the country?,Rakoto Frah,Philibert Rabezoza,bert,99b664ddec39d6a706c7a8fc83dcacb6,What is the common name of the person who first played at traditional ceremonies around the country?,Rakoto Frah,"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah,",bert,201d82d9ee362a177b4a23e2b3fc3ba8,What is the common name of the person who first played at traditional ceremonies around the country?,Rakoto Frah,Rabezoza,bert,17d07ff24275abe94283ff5e3f4545fa,What is the common name of the person who promoted the music of the highlands of Madagascar?,Rakoto Frah,Philibert Rabezoza,bert,588e079464e7a1e6262168a4aba9e9ec,What is the common name of the person who promoted the music of the highlands of Madagascar?,Rakoto Frah,"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah,",bert,6b21aada34843c6581d676ae5f20d0da,What is the common name of the person who promoted the music of the highlands of Madagascar?,Rakoto Frah,Rabezoza,bert,89fed1eae1523b0597cc21409eecfd92,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Philibert Rabezoza was born in 1923 in Ankadinandriana, a suburb of Antananarivo. His mother was born in Antananarivo and his father, a herdsman and farmer from Fianarantsoa, had previously been a singer at the Merina royal court before the colonization of Madagascar in 1897. Both of Philibert's parents were already aged at the time of his birth and they struggled to care for their new son alongside his six brothers and four sisters. As a child, Philibert assisted his family with looking after the livestock and farming their plot of land. In his early years he was given the nickname Rakoto by an older brother of the same name.Like many residents of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the sodina, an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One of the oldest and most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from Borneo around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the central highlands. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his skills by listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. His competitors, who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he stepped forward to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at Mahamasina stadium in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left the bakery to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.",b94876721868f8971867a585b4175c94,What is the first name of the person who began playing the sodina when he was 7 years old?,Philibert,Philibert Rabezoza,bert,6f5cb244b09d0ab153ecfd8652f85735,What is the first name of the person who began playing the sodina when he was 7 years old?,Philibert,Philibert's,bert,5a88bb1369873324cd0f85bdd1b759ac,What is the first name of the person who began playing the sodina when he was 7 years old?,Philibert,Rakoto,bert,7ddf2cb74ae48f49a0420e8ef9433f50,What is the first name of the person who began playing the sodina when he was 7 years old?,Philibert,"Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition.

"Philibert Rabezoza was born in 1923 in Ankadinandriana, a suburb of Antananarivo.

"Princess Anne plans to run away with Freddie Granton, the commoner secretary of her father, King Eric VIII, once her domineering mother, Queen Martha, has left for a vacation in America. Anne is therefore aghast when the Marquis of Birten brings news that he has negotiated her political marriage to Prince William of Grec, a man she has never even met. Dismissing Anne's vehement protests, the Queen is delighted, a feeling not shared by Anne's loving but ineffectual father. Meanwhile, the Premier and General Northrup warn that a revolution is brewing. He wishes to execute large numbers of political prisoners, but cannot without the King's signature. The Queen wholeheartedly approves of these stern measures. The King promises to attend to it, but after Northrup and the Queen leave, he orders his secretary to misplace the death warrants. Led by Laker, the rebels rise up after Northrup gets Parliament to grant him dictatorial powers. Anne seizes the opportunity to try to flee with Granton, with her father's approval. However, when she believes that the King is in real danger, she refuses to leave him. Doctor Fellman, a moderate rebel leader, comes to see the King to demand his abdication, but agrees to stop the fighting in favor of negotiation. Then Northrup insists he is in charge now and laughs in derision when the King claims the people are stronger than Northrup's army and navy. Next to arrive is Prince William. Despite his admission that he dislikes Anne, he is prepared to do his duty and go through with the wedding. Then Fellman and Laker show up. The King surprises Northrup by dismissing him from his service and putting Fellman in charge, ordering him to set up general elections as soon as possible.",585e851df4adfcb68275e1054f6591ed,What is the title of the person who is to be married to Prince William of Grec?,Princess,"King Eric VIII, once her domineering mother, Queen Martha,",bert,407d31592a4e95a84741d6ae92a3be79,What is the title of the person who is to be married to Prince William of Grec?,Princess,Princess Anne,bert,10d0ff9f42c1536153075004b2fbcb88,What is the title of the person who is to be married to Prince William of Grec?,Princess,"Princess Anne plans to run away with Freddie Granton, the commoner secretary of her father, King Eric VIII,",bert,1652b8d89b20761135ae3f0eabe57915,What is the title of the person who is to be married to Prince William of Grec?,Princess,"Queen Martha,",bert,bc48fd4788879314081c5b54aedb7de7,What is the title of the person who is to be married to Prince William of Grec?,Princess,"Queen Martha, has left for a vacation in America.

"Prior to Christmas 2001, Bostaph sustained a chronic elbow injury which hindered his ability to drum, resulting in his decision to leave the band. His third-to-last performance with Slayer was recorded on War at the Warfield. To date, Bostaph has not viewed the footage; he has likened the experience to ""breaking up with a girlfriend,"" and wants to move on with his life. Bostaph does not regret his time spent with the band, and described the period as a high point in his career. Bostaph eventually rejoined Slayer in 2013, once again replacing Dave Lombardo. Without a drummer the band were unable to finish their God Hates Us All tour. Hanneman contacted original drummer Dave Lombardo almost ten years after his departure, and asked him if he would be willing to play for the remainder of the tour. Lombardo accepted the offer, and played for the remaining 21 shows; however, he did not take on a permanent position with the band.Following the tour, the band continued their search for a permanent drummer, and sought solicitation via demo tape and snail mail. Interested fans sent video recordings of renditions of the songs ""Disciple,"" ""God Send Death,"" ""Stain of Mind,"" ""Angel of Death"", ""Postmortem/Raining Blood,"" ""South of Heaven,"" ""War Ensemble,"" and ""Seasons in the Abyss""; complete with résumés. The band listened to hundreds of demo tapes, and created a ""good pile"" and ""ungood pile,"" though the ""ungood"" was much larger. Those whose performances the band were pleased with were offered an audition in Dallas, San Francisco or Peoria, Illinois; many applicants, however, were unable to attend due to flight costs. The band auditioned roughly two to three drummers a day, and their top choice was one of Lombardo's recommendations. However, the band ultimately returned to Lombardo after deciding that they could not find a drummer who suited the job; Lombardo re-joined Slayer and attended music festivals worldwide to promote God Hates Us All and record drums on the 2006 album Christ Illusion.",83746631c66744bfe7b0dff5d759b1db,What is the full name of the person that started playing drums on the God Hates Us All tour?,Bostaph,"Bostaph eventually rejoined Slayer in 2013, once again replacing Dave Lombardo.",bert,1a23b1a1d58e74cd7e447840dcbd89c4,What is the full name of the person that started playing drums on the God Hates Us All tour?,Bostaph,Dave Lombardo,bert,64471f1638fca5cbed3e463477fae370,What is the full name of the person that started playing drums on the God Hates Us All tour?,Bostaph,Dave Lombardo.

"Prior to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and its eventual decipherment, the ancient Egyptian language and script had not been understood since shortly before the fall of the Roman Empire. The usage of the hieroglyphic script had become increasingly specialised even in the later Pharaonic period; by the 4th century AD, few Egyptians were capable of reading them. Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased after the closing of all non-Christian temples in 391 by Roman Emperor Theodosius I; the last known inscription is dated to 24 August 394, found at Philae and known as the Graffito of Esmet-Akhom.Hieroglyphs retained their pictorial appearance, and classical authors emphasised this aspect, in sharp contrast to the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, an explanation of almost 200 glyphs. His work was believed to be authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th.

The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.",657bb8e473e35906fc1c1bdc660d4e75,What is the last name of the scholar that used the key stone to decipher the script that had not been understood since the 4th century?,Champollion,"Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher",bert,cadf848d7cab94585bf758da98cd1b4b,What is the last name of the scholar that used the key stone to decipher the script that had not been understood since the 4th century?,Champollion,"Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga",bert,4424bca1da4b556db7af596074fa1e2e,What is the last name of the scholar that used the key stone to decipher the script that had not been understood since the 4th century?,Champollion,Goropius Becanus,bert,fa85e367f357fe7ad26b7c6a7dc44cbc,What is the last name of the scholar that used the key stone to decipher the script that had not been understood since the 4th century?,Champollion,Kircher,bert,05a20e1a76328fa3ed445de38e177d78,What puzzle did Jean-Francois Champollion solve?,hieroglyphic script,Sphinx.,bert,0acaece3720aef55dde4d5b3bbe1f0f7,What puzzle did Jean-Francois Champollion solve?,hieroglyphic script,of the Sphinx.,bert,a8911488441adc7b40bd3676e7bb51a8,What puzzle did Jean-Francois Champollion solve?,hieroglyphic script,riddle of the Sphinx.,bert,8ee5fee1b71f6bf05d6e9fa64a38f5e7,What puzzle did Jean-Francois Champollion solve?,hieroglyphic script,the riddle,bert,0c5f3cbf043a0280904970210f6c198c,What was the full name of the person who solved the puzzle that Kircher called the riddle of the Sphinx?,Jean-François Champollion,Athanasius Kircher,bert,1bc8c9f4370cd790e0e31b7ba8061362,What was the full name of the person who solved the puzzle that Kircher called the riddle of the Sphinx?,Jean-François Champollion,Jean-François,bert,d7f448b03fb0ed15813d2f6a06436542,What was the full name of the person who solved the puzzle that Kircher called the riddle of the Sphinx?,Jean-François Champollion,Johannes Goropius Becanus,bert,a50e6f2ca13335c769b56502853d399b,What was the full name of the person who solved the puzzle that Kircher called the riddle of the Sphinx?,Jean-François Champollion,Theodosius I;,bert,8393863c368314c0d1133dcc09c40556,What was the full name of the person who solved the puzzle that Kircher called the riddle of the Sphinx?,Jean-François Champollion,ion,bert,0aad5c748a5345e7c490d8eb546a70b7,What were the names of the three European scholars who continued to study hieroglyphs with fruitless attempts at decipherment?,Johannes Goropius Becanus,Becanus,bert,005abf5255fd4e4f32f6d711e4798854,What were the names of the three European scholars who continued to study hieroglyphs with fruitless attempts at decipherment?,Johannes Goropius Becanus,Dhul-Nun al-Misri,bert,3be4afe031393b9b33cc999f712e088f,What were the names of the three European scholars who continued to study hieroglyphs with fruitless attempts at decipherment?,Johannes Goropius Becanus,Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya,bert,72da39bef837517cc8316894ebe6c138,What were the names of the three European scholars who continued to study hieroglyphs with fruitless attempts at decipherment?,Johannes Goropius Becanus,Johannes,bert,003aa0e3c55878afe223c0a56a834899,What were the names of the three European scholars who continued to study hieroglyphs with fruitless attempts at decipherment?,Johannes Goropius Becanus,"Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher",bert,e130e1266936515286bad4eeaa261178,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Private Meredith Bixby simply cannot fall in line with army procedure, even though he has had 17 months of training. A psychologist, is assigned to turn him into a good soldier, so she enlists two fellow servicemen to help Bixby with his training. About the only thing that he can do right is remember things with his photographic memory. Eventually they are assigned to a base in Morocco. One night they all head off to a bar where Bixby gets drunk on ""Moroccan Delights"", which he thinks are malteds. He gets involved with a femme fatale and is kidnapped by some Arabian renegades. Abdul guards Bixby and makes him assemble a stolen cannon, knowing that Bixby had already memorized the assembly instructions back at the base. Bixby is eventually rescued by his fellow soldiers and they are all presented with medals of honor. Unfortunately, when Bixby mishandles a rifle that suddenly goes off, he damages the drinking glasses of the General and two visiting French officers.

"Private detective Humphrey Campbell tracks down a runaway woman, Louise, and ends up marrying her. On the way to Reno, Nevada, for their honeymoon, the couple stop at a bank, which is robbed by three men.  Humphrey's employer, Oscar Flack of the Flack Missing Persons Bureau, tracks the newlyweds to a Reno hotel. (Across from the hotel, Louise spots an odd advertising clock, which has no hands. This has no bearing on anything, however.) Oscar wants him to find a missing man, Hal Benedict. Louise convinces him to take the case after Oscar promises her a fur coat for locating Hal. They go to see Warren Benedict, Hal's father. When Humphrey learns the FBI may be involved, he wants nothing to do with the case, but Oscar gets him to change his mind. Humphrey tries to keep Louise out of danger, but she has other ideas and keeps tagging along. In the hotel bar, Humphrey learns that Hal was often seen with a woman, a redhead named Irene Donovan. A blonde named ""Gypsy"" Toland offers him a ride to Irene's place, but when Humphrey is spotted by a furious Louise, he gets out of the car. Humphrey later finds Irene dead. He also finds a very much alive Rose Madden, Hal's fiancée, who protests that she did not kill Irene. They drive off in Rose's car, then park and start talking. Louise spots him with the brunette Rose. Louise is ready to walk out on Humphrey, but the police will not let her leave because her husband is now a murder suspect.  Humphrey goes to see Clyde Copley, a collections investigator who admits he was hired by Hal to retrieve letters Hal wrote to Irene; Irene had threatened to use them if he married Rose Madden.

"Professional kickboxing champion Rick Quinn has announced his retirement from the sport. Willard, the one time reporter he could not stand, has now become good friends with him and Quinn plans to live quietly with his pregnant wife Carol. However, one person unhappy with the retirement is Jacques Denard, who has wanted revenge on Quinn from their previous fight in which Quinn defeated him. Denard wanted to fight Quinn for the championship and now he finds that chance gone as Quinn has retired. When Denard shows up at Quinn's house to confront him, he is forced to leave at gunpoint by Carol. Meanwhile, Quinn has attracted the attention of Dominique Le Braque, a rich businessman and lover of fights. However, as a fight promoter, he stages underground fights in which the loser finds himself shot in the head by the referee after the match is over. When Le Braque attempts to woo Quinn to fight for him, Quinn refuses as he tells him he is done as a professional. To ensure Quinn does join him, Le Braque hires some men to plant a car bomb, killing Carol and their unborn child. The incident has really destroyed Quinn mentally to the point where despite help from Willard, Quinn has turned to alcoholism. He thinks Denard was the one who is responsible for killing Carol and in a drunken rage, confronts him and serves a three-month jail sentence for drunken assault.

"Publisher Larry Fellowes believes that his stenographer/secretary (played by Dale Fuller) spends more time with him and makes more decisions than a wife would for her husband. He persuades author Kate Halsey to write a novel based on this premise. When Larry's secretary learns of his plans to marry Linda, the secretary has a nervous breakdown because she is in love with him herself. A new attractive, intelligent and efficient secretary, Anne Murdock, is hired while Larry is on his honeymoon. Larry, a workaholic, begins to neglect his wife working with his secretary, and they both fall in love. Meanwhile, his wife is seeing another man (played by Brooks Benedict), with whom she falls in love. Eventually, Larry kisses Anne while they are working together at his apartment, while Linda makes love with her young gigolo, who gives her the key to his apartment and says goodnight. Linda returns to her husband (after giving them enough time to compose themselves) and tells Larry that they should go to bed as it is very late. Anne watches as Larry goes to the bedroom with his wife and closes the door behind him. She is heartbroken and decides she will give him her resignation in the morning.Linda decides to divorce Larry. Anne agrees to marry her long-time admirer Ted O'Hara after giving her resignation. On the final day of work, Anne's sister Katherine Murdock phones the confused Larry and explains everything, bringing about a happy ending.",4f788eaf92c7725a74c86d0f5986826d,Who is secretly in love with Larry before he gets married?,his stenographer/secretary,Anne,bert,07a92e6730bd076adc59537510e2a0c0,Who is secretly in love with Larry before he gets married?,his stenographer/secretary,"Anne Murdock,",bert,e972f0293ca642ffeeab34f46ac93a3e,Who is secretly in love with Larry before he gets married?,his stenographer/secretary,"Kate Halsey to write a novel based on this premise.

"Puss in Boots is a talking cat named for his signature pair of boots. Puss is a fugitive on the run from the law, looking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the outlaw couple Jack and Jill have the magic beans he has been looking for most of his life, which can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a female cat named Kitty Softpaws interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his origin story and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs. The trio steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert. Puss and Kitty's relationship becomes romantic. The trio ride the beanstalk into the clouds to find the castle of the late giant, while avoiding the Great Terror, a giant goose that guards the Golden Goose. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose, which is just a gosling, and escape the castle. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knock Puss unconscious.

"Rakoto's opportunity for national fame arrived with the 1958 visit of French President Charles de Gaulle to Madagascar. The visit was in conjunction with the dissolution of colonial status and naming of Philibert Tsiranana as Prime Minister, part of the island's transition to full independence in 1960. Tsiranana had previously seen the flutist perform and invited Rakoto and his group of 18 musicians to accompany de Gaulle and perform traditional pieces during a portion of the French statesman's walking tour through the capital city of Antananarivo. Following this performance, Rakoto dedicated himself full-time to a career in music, performing regularly at traditional celebrations on the island. Tsiranana, who became president of Madagascar two years later, was the first to refer to the artist as Rakoto Frah, the name that the musician would use for the rest of his career.International recognition of Rakoto Frah and his performance of traditional sodina music began with his first overseas voyage to Algeria in 1967. The artist led a troupe of 18 Malagasy musicians selected to represent the island's various ethnic groups at the International Festival of Algiers. Among the 80 competitors hailing from a variety of countries, Rakoto Frah's troupe won the gold medal. This success was followed by performances in Japan, England, the United States, India, Germany, China, Norway, Finland, Australia and France, making him one of the first musicians to perform traditional Malagasy music at music festivals and concerts outside of Madagascar. At these performances, he was often accompanied by supporting musicians under the group name Orchestre Nationale. By exposing international audiences to sodina performances, Rakoto Frah promoted the instrument and the traditional musical heritage of Madagascar across the globe. The government of President Tsirananana fell into disfavor and was overturned in 1972, and Rakoto Frah's close association with the unpopular former head of state led the artist to be marginalized for the first half of the administration of his successor, Didier Ratsiraka (1975–1993).",3c5ef9c10a0a7789cefc70ad49f4653f,In what country did Rakoto Frah's troupe win the gold medal?,Algeria,"England,",bert,dfe35532a0e4b8c7bd0f91388b7bf5ea,In what country did Rakoto Frah's troupe win the gold medal?,Algeria,"Japan,",bert,118dd81b1b6a75d59b11dd378780803b,In what country did Rakoto Frah's troupe win the gold medal?,Algeria,"Japan, England,",bert,952da0bd29267c63f50631d549dbec0c,In what country did Rakoto Frah's troupe win the gold medal?,Algeria,Madagascar,bert,19dc883e737a1879582fbb8565da5a78,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Ratanakiri has been occupied since at least the Stone or Bronze Age, and trade between the region's highlanders and towns along the Gulf of Thailand dates to at least the 4th century A.D. The region was invaded by Annamites, the Cham, the Khmer, and the Thai during its early history, but no empire ever brought the area under centralized control. From the 13th century or earlier until the 19th century, highland villages were often raided by Khmer, Lao, and Thai slave traders. The region was conquered by local Laotian rulers in the 18th century and then by the Thai in the 19th century. The area was incorporated into French Indochina in 1893, and colonial rule replaced slave trading.  The French built huge rubber plantations, especially in Labansiek (present-day Banlung); indigenous workers were used for construction and rubber harvesting. While under French control, the land comprising present-day Ratanakiri was transferred from Siam (Thailand) to Laos and then to Cambodia. Although highland groups initially resisted their colonial rulers, by the end of the colonial era in 1953 they had been subdued.Ratanakiri Province was created in 1959 from land that had been the eastern area of Stung Treng Province. The name Ratanakiri (រតនគិរី) is formed from the Khmer words រតនៈ (ratana ""gem"" from Sanskrit ratna) and គិរី (kiri ""mountain"" from Sanskrit giri), describing two features for which the province is known. During the 1950s and 1960s, Norodom Sihanouk instituted a development and Khmerization campaign in northeast Cambodia that was designed to bring villages under government control, limit the influence of insurgents in the area, and ""modernize"" indigenous communities. Some Khmer Loeu were forcibly moved to the lowlands to be educated in Khmer language and culture, ethnic Khmer from elsewhere in Cambodia were moved into the province, and roads and large rubber plantations were built. After facing harsh working conditions and sometimes involuntary labor on the plantations, many Khmer Loeu left their traditional homes and moved farther from provincial towns. In 1968, tensions led to an uprising by the Brao in which several Khmer were killed. The government responded harshly, torching settlements and killing hundreds of villagers.",6fb17f3d50b4f20bdf06b0a255d42d35,What is the former name of the area where the French built huge rubber plantations?,Banlung,(present-day Banlung);,bert,063ad80c2870622722f7d4d3cb46be3e,What is the former name of the area where the French built huge rubber plantations?,Banlung,"Banlung); indigenous workers were used for construction and rubber harvesting.

"Ratanakiri or Ratanak Kiri (Khmer: រតនគិរី IPA: [ˌreə̯̆ʔ taʔ ˈnaʔ ki ˈriː]), is a province of northeast Cambodia. It borders the provinces of Mondulkiri to the south and Stung Treng to the west and the countries of Laos and Vietnam to the north and east, respectively. The province extends from the mountains of the Annamite Range in the north, across a hilly plateau between the Tonle San and Tonle Srepok rivers, to tropical deciduous forests in the south. In recent years, logging and mining have scarred Ratanakiri's environment, long known for its beauty. For over a millennium, Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland Khmer Loeu people, who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia. During the region's early history, its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as slaves by neighboring empires. The slave trade economy ended during the French colonial era, but a harsh Khmerization campaign after Cambodia's independence again threatened Khmer Loeu ways of life.  The Khmer Rouge built its headquarters in the province in the 1960s, and bombing during the Vietnam War devastated the region. Today, rapid development in the province is altering traditional ways of life. Ratanakiri is sparsely populated; its 184,000 residents make up just over 1% of the country's total population. Residents generally live in villages of 20 to 60 families and engage in subsistence shifting agriculture. Ratanakiri is among the least developed provinces of Cambodia. Its infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak. Health indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor; men's life expectancy is 39 years, and women's is 43 years. Education levels are also low, with just under half of the population illiterate.",d736c68480fb31a06bb618fbf1f7317e,How many people live in the province that borders the provinces of Mondulkiri to the south and Stung Treng to the west?,"184,000","184,000 residents make up just over 1% of the country's total population.

"Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: ""Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound."" When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they ""would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity"". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from ""the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner ... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto.""Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909. As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation.",dc6d31e54fe467b8009a7209fd791edf,In what city was Ravel's first concert outside of France?,London,1909,bert,35c0cf9c7fb176b68653df9b80ef2312,In what city was Ravel's first concert outside of France?,London,"1909.

"Richard ""Dick"" Purcell, a taxi driver, aspires to achieve his dream of becoming a singer. After a couple of theatre critics discover him while riding in his cab, one of them recommends him to a radio producer. The producer's secretary, Alice Hughes, hears him sing and falls in love with him. She sets up an audition for Dick to sing for the sponsor, Mrs. Flaggenheim. He's late for his audition and blows his big chance.  Convinced she must go to Italy to find a good enough singer, with enough ""romance"" to represent her fine cheese products, Mrs. Flaggenheim takes Alice with her to find one in Venice.

"Richard ""Dick"" Purcell, a taxi driver, aspires to achieve his dream of becoming a singer. After a couple of theatre critics discover him while riding in his cab, one of them recommends him to a radio producer. The producer's secretary, Alice Hughes, hears him sing and falls in love with him. She sets up an audition for Dick to sing for the sponsor, Mrs. Flaggenheim. He's late for his audition and blows his big chance.  Convinced she must go to Italy to find a good enough singer, with enough ""romance"" to represent her fine cheese products, Mrs. Flaggenheim takes Alice with her to find one in Venice. Dick watches as Alice boards the ship and manages to get on board and work for his passage to Italy.

"Richard and Rachel are a childless middle-aged couple desperately trying to have a child. After multiple failed attempts at artificial insemination they attempt in vitro fertilisation where they learn that Richard has a blockage that is not letting him produce sperm forcing him to choose a quick surgery and go $10,000 dollars in debt to his brother Charlie and Charlie's wife Cynthia. At the same time they are also attempting to adopt a child after having previously being matched with a pregnant teenager from Little Rock who was looking to give up her child and then stopped contacting them. After the IVF fails their doctor floats the idea of using a donor egg to inseminate Rachel which would raise their chances of success from 4 to 65 percent. Rachel is initially against the idea, but slowly begins to contemplate it with Richard's encouragement. Cynthia's 25 year old daughter, Sadie, meanwhile decides to leave her college writing program to finish in absentia and go live with Richard and Rachel, with whom she is already very close. Rachel, who struggled with the idea of an unknown egg donor, decides that she wants to ask Sadie for her eggs. To their surprise Sadie quickly agrees, both because she loves Richard and Rachel and because she thinks the egg donation will bring meaning to her life. Sadie informs her mother she will be donating her egg during Thanksgiving, much to her mother's displeasure. Despite the fact that Richard and Rachel tell Cynthia they will not go through with the donation without her consent, they decide to go through with pre-screening.",02e6c9fce9ffcd24e3699d1ce7c53f53,What are the names of the two people Cynthia's daughter is close to?,Richard,Charlie,bert,45cb2013646df3ea405483c234c7a178,What are the names of the two people Cynthia's daughter is close to?,Richard,Richard and Rachel,bert,3e1192b4b611fc06e60e3c6322cbc958,What are the names of the two people Cynthia's daughter is close to?,Richard,"Richard and Rachel, with whom she is already very close.

"Robert and Cathy Wilson (Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr) are a timid married couple in 1940 London. He is a bookkeeper, she a bored housewife. However, their tedium-filled lives are drastically changed by the war. He enlists in the Royal Navy, while she (against his wishes) joins the Wrens. During the three years the couple are apart, they are transformed, each becoming much more self-confident. Cathy's assertive new friend, Dizzy Clayton, helps her break out of her shell. She begins going out with Dizzy's cousin, naval architect Richard, who falls in love with her. However, she remains faithful (if unenthusiastically) to her husband. Meanwhile, Robert toughens up on sea duty and in time becomes a petty officer. His hands are badly burned when his ship is sunk, but he stoically rows in the lifeboat for five days without complaint. He recuperates in a hospital, tended by Elena, a beautiful nurse. On the last night of his stay, he asks her out to dinner.

"Sandringham is recorded in the Domesday Book as ""sant-Dersingham"" and the land was awarded to a Norman knight, Robert Fitz-Corbun after the Conquest. The local antiquarian Claude Messent, in his study The Architecture on the Royal Estate of Sandringham, records the discovery of evidence of the pavements of a Roman villa. In the Elizabethan era a manor was built on the site of the present house, which, by the 18th century, came into the possession of the Hoste Henley family, descendants of Dutch refugees. In 1771 Cornish Henley cleared the site to build a Georgian mansion, Sandringham Hall. In 1834, Henry Hoste Henley died without issue, and the estate was bought at auction by John Motteux, a London merchant. Motteux was also without heirs and bequeathed Sandringham, together with another Norfolk estate and a property in Surrey, to the third son of his close friend, Emily Lamb, the wife of Lord Palmerston. At the time of his inheritance in 1843, Charles Spencer Cowper was a bachelor diplomat, resident in Paris. On succeeding to Motteux's estates, he sold the other properties and based himself at Sandringham. He undertook extensions to the hall, employing Samuel Sanders Teulon to add an elaborate porch and conservatory. Cowper's style of living was extravagant—he and his wife spent much of their time on the Continent—and within 10 years the estate was mortgaged for £89,000. The death of their only child, Mary Harriette, from cholera in 1854 led the couple to spend even more time abroad, mainly in Paris, and by the early 1860s Cowper was keen to sell the estate.",2f23aa7e31e3eea692a342b1a2f3e8f0,What is the first name of Cowper's daughter?,Mary,Charles,bert,c5090089920df366eda4945082db457c,What is the first name of Cowper's daughter?,Mary,Emily,bert,969fb927021705f7657db99fdd31745c,What is the first name of Cowper's daughter?,Mary,"Emily Lamb, the wife of Lord Palmerston.

"School principal Martin Cramer and schoolteacher Sally are a married couple in their 30s who are stuck in a rut. Their Upper East Side apartment is mostly unfurnished five weeks after they moved from Orchard Street because Sally forgot the name of the moving company. Sally wants to bring a juvenile delinquent student of hers named Carlton in to live with them, but Martin reminds her that the boy stole from him the last time they took him in. Sally laments that Martin is no longer the idealistic person he once was. When Sally says it is time they have a child of their own, Martin tells her to go to sleep. A week later, Sally, who is pregnant, initiates divorce proceedings and then leaves to stay with a friend while she considers getting an abortion. Sally phones Gordon, a man she met in the park, and Gordon invites her to his apartment. After a pleasant conversation Gordon reveals he is married with children to a woman who will not give him a divorce and they decide they would be better off as friends.

"Set 19 years after the events of the first film, the movie deals with unresolved conflict and family strain, and also has elements of a coming of age story. Michael Goorjian reprises his role of Heroin Bob, and acts as a narrator for the film, both in voice over as well as sporadically intercut scenes of him in the afterlife Ross is the child of Trish and Heroin Bob, being conceived shortly before Bob's accidental drug overdose. Ross has been raised by alone by Trish, above her steam punk curio and clothing boutique, and as a result of his mothers adoration of the macabre, as well as his immersion in the concept of death from a young age, he develops into a Victorian Goth. Despite his obvious affiliation, Ross insists that he is part of no social cliques, which is stressed even further when he states that despite a lifelong abstinence from drugs, alcohol, and sex; he is not Straight Edge either.  Upon having his heart broken by his first girlfriend, Ross attempts to drown his sorrows, as well as his lifelong espousal that romantic love is trivial, with the aide of beer and liquor. In an attempt to further help him take his mind off of things, he also begrudgingly goes on a road trip to a punk rock concert with his only friend, Crash, as well as Crash's friend Penny.

"Set between the events of Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 3, the story follows online reporter Chase Carter and his camerawoman Jordan as they cover the stories of the people inside of the walled-in quarantined area in the fictional town of East Mission, Oregon, as the government (running an organization called F.E.Z.A.—Federal Emergency Zombie Authority) attempts to contain a viral outbreak that turns people into ravenous zombies. An anti-viral drug called Zombrex, that keeps the virus at bay, is being administered to those infected. When it becomes clear that the drug is no longer effective and a zombie outbreak purges the town and infects its inhabitants, Chase, Jordan, grieving mother Maggie, and survivor Crystal battle their way out of the city before it gets firebombed. Throughout the film, it is revealed that the Army implanted bad Zombrex in a refugee center to start another outbreak so that the government can be allowed to plant government-mandated Zombrex chips on the infected to track them, framing F.E.Z.A. for giving bad Zombrex to the infected. The coin that Jordan gave to Chase to open a newspaper vending machine at the beginning came in handy when she placed evidence of the Army sabotaging the Zombrex inside the vending machine for him to find. When General Lyons figures out that Jordan and Norton are aware of the Army's actions, he has his men capture them to cover up the truth. In the end, Chase and Crystal manage to survive and get out of city, and Jordan manages to get footage proving the Army's complicity in the new outbreak to Chase, who finds it in the newspaper vending machine; the same footage shows her being taken into custody by the U.S. government, who then implant tracking devices on people who are infected.",b52e15631dfa8712fc50b4870a94458f,What is the job of the person who captures footage that proves the Army's complicity in the outbreak?,camerawoman,camera,bert,6e133e4fc0aa18cf40119a154d0d1bb2,What is the job of the person who captures footage that proves the Army's complicity in the outbreak?,camerawoman,online reporter,bert,414d967cc4cb5af4dd38f7505e0d0bc0,What is the job of the person who captures footage that proves the Army's complicity in the outbreak?,camerawoman,online reporter Chase Carter and his camerawoman,bert,c198d727e1f788f3526db7b13c1f61da,What is the job of the person who captures footage that proves the Army's complicity in the outbreak?,camerawoman,reporter,bert,d739c01be88a1a9d5d15ded1d549720b,What is the job of the person who captures footage that proves the Army's complicity in the outbreak?,camerawoman,reporter Chase Carter and his camerawoman,bert,92be70cf77e22e25c38128a5020f8c20,Where did the camerawoman put the evidence?,the vending machine,"East Mission,",bert,404d1923f8136a2c1a5418e96d590c41,Where did the camerawoman put the evidence?,the vending machine,"East Mission, Oregon,",bert,2dfbe61f67f12c881bf7931a0c2cde71,Where did the camerawoman put the evidence?,the vending machine,a newspaper vending machine,bert,9173d8b59b097ca0dffae44b58db6996,Where did the camerawoman put the evidence?,the vending machine,open a newspaper vending machine,bert,48a041dc0a721870652246b09677f20d,Who is trying to make the reporter realize that the Army is responsible for the outbreak?,Jordan,Chase Carter,bert,921dfb809a2672d19c12cc5f0b790045,Who is trying to make the reporter realize that the Army is responsible for the outbreak?,Jordan,Chase Carter and his camerawoman Jordan,bert,2ef0f551dc20569aba47f9d358f7fe5c,Who is trying to make the reporter realize that the Army is responsible for the outbreak?,Jordan,General Lyons,bert,6671fde7d5daed6eed0bf3daf14eb485,Who is trying to make the reporter realize that the Army is responsible for the outbreak?,Jordan,"U.S. government,",bert,94c23222b14e8610fbf0754ea10ed3ca,Who is trying to make the reporter realize that the Army is responsible for the outbreak?,Jordan,"Zombrex chips on the infected to track them, framing F.E.Z.A.",bert,5563f2689ccac3a2c74bb8037469b389,Who's making it appear that the group trying to contain the zombie outbreak are to blame?,the Army,Chase Carter and his camerawoman Jordan,bert,2ac0efb54864012b90d15adedb45ee1e,Who's making it appear that the group trying to contain the zombie outbreak are to blame?,the Army,General Lyons,bert,81822673c6f74f6fd7bc16b472abf864,Who's making it appear that the group trying to contain the zombie outbreak are to blame?,the Army,"U.S. government,",bert,a517f44abd3a35cff739fe601c32b9a7,Who's making it appear that the group trying to contain the zombie outbreak are to blame?,the Army,the government,bert,e9386c04296dda9016d7339f6fb9955c,Who's making it appear that the group trying to contain the zombie outbreak are to blame?,the Army,the government (running an organization called F.E.Z.A.—Federal Emergency Zombie Authority),bert,868a8875f2402fabc604b358eefb1372,none,none,none,none,none
"Set in New York City, the movie follows a martial artist named Leroy Green (Taimak) (also known as ""Bruce Leeroy""), who has dreams of becoming a great martial artist like his idol Bruce Lee. His master explains that he has reached the final level of martial arts accomplishment known as ""The Last Dragon"". Martial artists who reach this final level are said to be able to concentrate such mystical energy into their hands that they begin to glow. Only a true martial arts master would be able to exhibit ""The Glow"" over his entire body. Leroy doesn't fully understand and, in possession of a medal supposedly belonging to Bruce Lee, Leroy embarks upon a journey to find Master Sum Dum Goy, whom his master claims can help Leroy unlock the power of ""The Glow"". Another martial artist, Sho'nuff (also known as ""The Shogun of Harlem"") sees Leroy as the only obstacle to being acknowledged as the true master of martial arts. Leroy refuses to fight him and a furious Sho'nuff vows that he will defeat Leroy. Sho'nuff and his gang later break in and assault one of the students at Leroy's martial arts school, Johnny Yu, demanding that Leroy bow before Sho'nuff. Finally, Sho'nuff and his gang attempt to send a message to Leroy by destroying the Green family pizza restaurant. Meanwhile, video arcade mogul Eddie Arkadian sends his men to kidnap 7th Heaven video host Laura Charles in the hopes of getting his girlfriend Angela Viracco's (Faith Prince) new music video featured on her show. The kidnap attempt is thwarted by Leroy who easily fends off the thugs. He loses his medal during the struggle, which Laura recovers. Later, Leroy witnesses Laura being kidnapped by Arkadian's brutish henchman Rock.

"Set in a rural environs outside the fictional town of Raupo in New Zealand, the film centres on sheep and cattle farmer Wal Footrot and his border collie sheepdog named Dog. Wal is assisted on his farm, Footrot Flats, by his nature-loving neighbour Cooch Windgrass, local boy Rangi Jones and Wal's niece Pongo Footrot.  Wal and Cooch are menaced by their unpleasant neighbours, the Murphys, comprising patriarch Irish and his two sons Spit and Hunk, who attempt to steal Cooch's deer and stag. When the Murphys buzz Wal's shearing shed from their ""deer slayer"" helicopter, Dog is stampeded into a sheep dip and starts to drown. This prompts a flashback sequence in which Dog recalls being given as a puppy to Wal by Aunt Dolly, and first meeting his future girlfriend Jess.  Wal's two non-farming preoccupations are his girlfriend, local hairdresser Cheeky Hobson, and impressing a selector for New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks. Dog opposes Wal's relationship with Cheeky, but has problems of his own when Jess is swept away in a flood and ends up at the Murphys' farm, where she is threatened by rats and ferocious ""croco-pigs"". Dog saves Jess from the rats, but the two dogs are then hunted by Irish Murphy. Meanwhile, Rangi has managed to get Wal away from a rugby game and over to the Murphys' farm. Dog and Jess end up floating out toward the sea on a raft with the fearless cat Horse, who has been shot by Irish. Rangi and Wal rescue Jess, but Dog and Horse are swept out to sea. Wal, Rangi, Pongo, Cooch and Jess rush to the beach but cannot see Dog or Horse.

"She's so fast and good at what she does that you can't afford to waste time on anything, so if we're ready to record drums, for example, we're going to work with whatever we have available right there and then. That's why we worked in such great studios, because we know they have great gear, and we don't need to worry about renting gear. Part of my job as an engineer is to make sure the sessions are not only moving along, but moving along at her pace. After the move to MSR, Beyoncé and her production team began travelling. In the United Kingdom, they worked at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Wiltshire—particularly using Gabriel's multi-instrument room—to create ""Love on Top"". Soon after, Beyoncé joined Jay-Z in a Sydney mansion, as he was working on his collaboration album Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West. There they created a ""primitive studio"" using a microphone, a rig out and Pro Tools software to record. Sessions were also held in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Honolulu.In February 2011, MTV reported the project was nearing completion. 4 was mixed mostly at MixStar Studios in Virginia and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York City. The audio mastering was delayed by a week following the unexpected recording of ""I Was Here"". Diane Warren had played the song to Jay-Z during a telephone conversation, leading him to put Warren and Beyoncé in contact. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs in preparation for the album's release. According to Swivel, an eclectic range of songs were recorded, including ballads, ""weird ethereal things"" and 1990's R&B and Afrobeat-inspired songs.

"Sherman 'Tank' Turner is a help line operator and a ladies man with a hobby: If a guy loses a girl and wants her back, he gets in touch with Tank and pays him to take the girl on a bad date.  Throughout the evening Tank inevitably behaves in the most moronic fashion causing the girl to realize that her ex was not really such a bad guy after all and get back to their ex. He shares an apartment with his step cousin Dustin who has fallen for his colleague Alexis. Dustin takes Alexis on a date and confesses his love but she insists they remain friends. After the date Dustin explains his situation to Tank who volunteers his services as a good friend (instead of having to pay for his services as usual). Dustin initially turns him down, not wanting Tank to be close to Alexis, but the next day sees Alexis flirting with another co-worker and begs Tank to take Alexis out. He accepts. Tank bumps into Alexis and they arrange to go out.  He behaves badly all night but Alexis is too drunk to care. When he drops her off she expects him to come in but he resists the temptation out of loyalty to Dustin. Alexis calls Dustin but when they meet she explains that her date with Tank has motivated her to see other men.  Dustin sends Alexis roses and an apology poem in Tank's name. Alexis calls Tank at work and berates him for leaving early the previous night.  Tank goes to see Alexis and they end up having casual sex on a regular basis while Dustin begins a series of desperate attempts to stay friends with her after all.",3f20460fb8e4e48b53888d02a1fb5000,What is the alias of the person who volunteers his services to his cousin?,Tank,'Tank' Turner,bert,211db93a3bd7fc7f79745d1f3f6effc6,What is the alias of the person who volunteers his services to his cousin?,Tank,Dustin explains his situation to Tank,bert,224b151c264f8831a4056c949454aaa5,What is the alias of the person who volunteers his services to his cousin?,Tank,Sherman 'Tank',bert,1c09d17095e092a152216999dada0ffc,What is the alias of the person who volunteers his services to his cousin?,Tank,Sherman 'Tank' Turner,bert,67ca7bcb867516b32d246cb6074cdc65,What is the first name of the person who begs Tank to take out Alexis?,Dustin,Dustin explains his situation to Tank who volunteers his services as a good friend (instead of having to pay for his services as usual).

Throughout the evening Tank inevitably behaves in the most moronic fashion causing the girl to realize that her ex was not really such a bad guy after all and get back to their ex. He shares an apartment with his step cousin Dustin who has fallen for his colleague Alexis. Dustin takes Alexis on a date and confesses his love but she insists they remain friends. After the date Dustin explains his situation to Tank who volunteers his services as a good friend (instead of having to pay for his services as usual). Dustin initially turns him down, not wanting Tank to be close to Alexis, but the next day sees Alexis flirting with another co-worker and begs Tank to take Alexis out. He accepts. Tank bumps into Alexis and they arrange to go out.  He behaves badly all night but Alexis is too drunk to care. When he drops her off she expects him to come in but he resists the temptation out of loyalty to Dustin. Alexis calls Dustin but when they meet she explains that her date with Tank has motivated her to see other men.  Dustin sends Alexis roses and an apology poem in Tank's name. Alexis calls Tank at work and berates him for leaving early the previous night.

"Sheyann Webb sees Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. going into Brown Chapel AME Church one day while playing outside with her friends. They are told that Dr. King has come to Selma, Alabama to help the Negro people get voting rights. Sheyann learns many things from Dr. King. He teaches her and her friend Rachel that when asked, ""Children, what do you want?"" their answer should be ""Freedom."" He also teaches her that everyone deserves to be treated with fairness, regardless of the color of their skin, and that children also have a battle to fight. Sheyann wants to get involved and skips school to sneak into the meetings. One night a friend of Sheyann's named Jimmie Lee Jackson is killed. To draw attention to the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson, it is decided that a 54-mile march to the state capital of Alabama will take place. Marchers will present a petition to Governor Wallace to protest that Negroes are not being treated fairly. On Sunday, March 7, 1965, a day that comes to be called Bloody Sunday, Sheyann and other African-American protesters march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge en route to Montgomery, and are attacked by police. Sheyann is the youngest person to attempt to march. In August, President Lyndon Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to oversee and enforce constitutional rights of suffrage and prevent discriminatory measures, such as use of literacy tests against potential voters.",c8ae566ac16c7fc7aec14a48441d7cef,What is the full name of the person who has a friend named Rachel?,Sheyann Webb,"Dr. Martin Luther King,",bert,f56ef59bf659e3708f669085591d1d41,What is the full name of the person who has a friend named Rachel?,Sheyann Webb,"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",bert,a742ba9c68489a26c349ff7ecf4499e1,What is the full name of the person who has a friend named Rachel?,Sheyann Webb,"Martin Luther King, Jr.",bert,ca24d358fffc1b405fc9b1a2f9f4db52,What is the full name of the person who has a friend named Rachel?,Sheyann Webb,"Sheyann Webb sees Dr. Martin Luther King,",bert,6c7476179673ff6d024a73d7d46550a8,What is the full name of the person who has a friend named Rachel?,Sheyann Webb,"Sheyann Webb sees Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",bert,65b3eeb1162d6e241e86322dbd7d455b,What is the state capital of Alabama?,Montgomery,"Brown Chapel AME Church one day while playing outside with her friends.

"Shortly after completing the tour for Pretty on the Inside, Love married Cobain on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 24, 1992. She wore a satin and lace dress once owned by actress Frances Farmer, and Cobain wore plaid pajamas. During Love's pregnancy, Hole recorded a cover of ""Over the Edge"" for a Wipers tribute album, and recorded their fourth single, ""Beautiful Son"", which was released in April 1993. On August 18 of that year, the couple's only child, a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born in Los Angeles. The couple subsequently relocated to Carnation, Washington and then to Seattle.Love's first major media exposure came in a September 1992 profile of herself and Cobain for Vanity Fair by journalist Lynn Hirschberg, entitled ""Strange Love."" After being asked to participate in a cover story for the magazine, Love was urged by her manager to accept the request. In the year prior, Love and Cobain had developed a heroin addiction, and the profile painted the couple in an unflattering light and suggested that Love had been addicted to heroin during her pregnancy. The article ultimately resulted in the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigating, and custody of Love and Cobain's newborn daughter, Frances, was temporarily awarded to Love's sister, Jaimee. Love claimed she was misquoted by Hirschberg, and asserted that she had immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant.

"Shortly after the failed 1944 20 July plot to assassinate him, Adolf Hitler, appoints General Dietrich von Choltitz as military governor of occupied Paris. Hitler believes Choltitz will obey his order that the Allies should not be allowed to capture Paris without the Germans destroying it completely, similar to the planned destruction of Warsaw. The French Resistance learn that the Allies are not planning to take Paris, but are heading straight to Germany instead. The two factions within the Resistance react to this news differently.

"Singing cowboy and rodeo star Gene Autry inherits half interest of a ranch and mining property from his late foster father, Henry ""Dad"" Erwin. The other half is left to Dad's niece, Barbara Erwin who arrives at the ranch from the East with her friend, Kitty Callahan. The will stipulates that each has an ""undivided interest"" in the inheritance—that each owns half of everything—and that nothing can be sold off without the approval of the other. In desperate need of money, Barbara expresses her desire to sell the mine as quickly as possible. Gene, however, wants to continue Dad's work on the mine, which employs Mexican rancheros whose land was ruined by dust storms. He explains that although the profits are currently put back into operations, eventually the mine will provide her with an income, and that without the mine, the rancheros will not survive. With not enough money to return East, Barbara and Kitty decide to stay, and plan to use their feminine wiles on Gene and his sidekick, Frog Millhouse, to get gene to change his mind about selling. Meanwhile, Gene assures the rancheros that the mine will not be sold and that he will continue Dad Erwin's work. After her sweet-talking fails to win Gene over to her side, Barbara hires attorneys Arnold and Fry to sell the mine for her, giving them the power of attorney. Unknown to Barbara, the unscrupulous lawyers have been trying for years to gain control of the mine. They order their henchman Tommick to get rid of Gene.

"Sir Francis Drake sailed from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, in command of a fleet of five ships under his flagship Pelican, later renamed the Golden Hinde. His principal objective was plunder, not exploration; his initial targets were the unfortified Spanish towns on the Pacific coasts of Chile and Peru. Following Magellan's route, Drake reached Puerto San Julian on 20 June. After nearly two months in harbour, Drake left the port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small pinnace. His ships entered the Magellan Strait on 23 August and emerged in the Pacific Ocean on 6 September.Drake set a course to the north-west, but on the following day a gale scattered the ships. The Marigold was sunk by a giant wave; the Elizabeth managed to return into the Magellan Strait, later sailing eastwards back to England; the pinnace was lost later. The gales persisted for more than seven weeks. The Golden Hinde was driven far to the west and south, before clawing its way back towards land. On 22 October, the ship anchored off an island which Drake named ""Elizabeth Island"", where wood for the galley fires was collected and seals and penguins captured for food.According to Drake's Portuguese pilot, Nuno da Silva, their position at the anchorage was 57°S. However, there is no island at that latitude. The as yet undiscovered Diego Ramírez Islands, at 56°30'S, are treeless and cannot have been the islands where Drake's crew collected wood. This indicates that the navigational calculation was faulty, and that Drake landed at or near the then unnamed Cape Horn, possibly on Horn Island itself. His final southern latitude can only be speculated as that of Cape Horn, at 55°59'S. In his report, Drake wrote: ""The Uttermost Cape or headland of all these islands stands near 56 degrees, without which there is no main island to be seen to the southwards but that the Atlantic Ocean and the South Sea meet."" This open sea south of Cape Horn became known as the Drake Passage even though Drake himself did not traverse it.",9950709b8fdabbdbb28c6bcc5f11aee0,What is the first name of the person who left the port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small pinnace?,Francis,Drake,bert,c483694244f7b6d0ecce7531b051ef31,What is the first name of the person who left the port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small pinnace?,Francis,Francis Drake,bert,697c9b28d1ea219ace95dcdbc98d0c63,What is the first name of the person who left the port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small pinnace?,Francis,Sir,bert,062a6a18d04bc6046c4b6054d3968e5d,What is the first name of the person who left the port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small pinnace?,Francis,Sir Francis,bert,4fd5a1b8cfcd8d3d62fc7fe0e45525a2,What is the first name of the person who left the port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small pinnace?,Francis,Sir Francis Drake,bert,093da4a535bc6b88ef982a5a5f3edcbe,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Sir Michael Kemp Tippett  (2 January 1905 – 8 January 1998) was an English composer who rose to prominence during and immediately after the  Second World War. In his lifetime he was sometimes  ranked with his contemporary Benjamin Britten as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century. Among his best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage. Tippett's talent developed slowly. He withdrew or destroyed his earliest compositions, and was 30 before any of his works were published. Until the mid-to-late 1950s his music was broadly lyrical in character, before changing to a more astringent and experimental style. New influences, including those of jazz and blues after his first visit to America in 1965, became increasingly evident in his compositions. While Tippett's stature with the public continued to grow, not all critics approved of these changes in style, some believing that the quality of his work suffered as a consequence. From around 1976 Tippett's late works began to reflect the works of his youth through a return to lyricism. Although he was much honoured in his lifetime, critical judgement on Tippett's legacy has been uneven, the greatest praise being generally reserved for his earlier works. His centenary in 2005 was a muted affair; apart from the few best-known works, his music has been performed  infrequently in the 21st century. Having briefly embraced communism in the 1930s, Tippett avoided identifying with any political party. A pacifist after 1940, he was imprisoned in 1943 for refusing to carry out war-related duties required by his military exemption. His initial difficulties in accepting his  homosexuality led him in 1939 to Jungian psychoanalysis; the Jungian dichotomy of ""shadow"" and ""light"" remained a recurring factor in his music. He was a strong advocate of music education, and was active for much of his life as a radio broadcaster and writer on music.",1e7e97bf0f4a296a21af08343c20e74a,"What is the last name of the composer among whose best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage?",Tippett,Britten,bert,019611d56a3fe8671094ebc2ff10a897,"What is the last name of the composer among whose best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage?",Tippett,Tippett's,bert,2c813d2e6d2ffddfedb9f2a0f086e047,"What is the last name of the composer among whose best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage?",Tippett,t,bert,c143c9c3a941d1402dcc42158d4a2250,What is the last name of the composer who destroyed his earliest compositions?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,7f6286a48d73ad0f2c262ba47dc8562c,What is the last name of the person who changed to a more astringent and experimental style?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,1570c06bc6eead89470aa97d2ad3ee6e,What is the last name of the person who was 30 before any of his works were published?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,392af631598d657911d30fb5ceab89a3,What is the last name of the person who was 30 before any of his works were published?,Tippett,t,bert,294064a311d790625436b4adc907e62a,"What is the last name of the person who was influenced by new styles, including jazz and blues?",Tippett,Tippett's,bert,19080cc174562950607e3c3b1349a8d7,What is the last name of the person who was sometimes ranked with his contemporary as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,79687252660a3ce2fb7fc78a3af220d4,What is the last name of the person who was sometimes ranked with his contemporary as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century?,Tippett,t,bert,6418c7457dd4747dd9abb66e82ffb2cb,What is the last name of the person whose best-known works include the opera The Midsummer Marriage?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,0950678b6928fb30b8442f5c550170d3,What is the last name of the person whose best-known works include the opera The Midsummer Marriage?,Tippett,t,bert,63b8582c56dccdae07497a2b826f5f85,What is the last name of the person whose best-known works include the oratorio A Child of Our Time?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,4b56b7f8d04368e8b88baff002084bf1,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Small-town church organist Marion Cullen falls in love with traveling salesman Jimmy Decker. When she learns that the couple who raised her are not really her parents, and that she is actually the illegitimate daughter of a showgirl, she sets out for New York City in search of Jimmy. However, she discovers that he is engaged to Enid Hollister, his boss' daughter. Dr. Travers, who is in love with Marion, offers to help her, but she decides to try to make it on her own. Jobs are scarce, however. She ends up with other hopeful showgirls, among them Dixie Dare, hoping to audition for a part in Ford Humphries' new production. The philandering Humphries likes what he sees in Marion and hires her as a piano accompanist. Dixie gets a job as well, and she and Marion become friends and roommates. Travers sees Humphries and Marion together, and knowing the former's reputation, brings Jimmy to Humphries' party. Jimmy tells Marion that he loves her, but she refuses to break up his marriage. When she also refuses Humphries' advances, he fires her. He then decides to use one of the songs she had composed for his production, claiming he wrote it. When she learns of this, she confronts him, although he denies everything. Jimmy goes to Humphries' suite to convince him to do the right thing. During their argument, Humphries stumbles and falls onto the balcony below and lapses into a coma from his injuries. Jimmy flees the scene; however, the police have a description of him and suspect him of attempted murder. To shield Jimmy, Marion confesses to the non-existent crime.

"Some temples kept sacred animals, which were believed to be manifestations of the temple god's ba in the same way that cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, ranging from a year to the lifetime of the animal. At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent of these animals were the Apis, a sacred bull worshipped as a manifestation of the  Memphite god Ptah, and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.During the Late Period, a different form of worship involving animals developed. In this case, laymen paid the priests to kill, mummify, and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god. These animals were not regarded as especially sacred, but as a species they were associated with the god because it was depicted in the form of that animal. The god Thoth, for instance, could be depicted as an ibis and as a baboon, and both ibises and baboons were given to him. Although this practice was distinct from the worship of single divine representatives, some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose. These practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals, such as the catacombs around the Serapeum of Saqqara where the Apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings.",4610a4554ee2b5266600c3798e84203b,What did the different form of worshiping animals in the Late Period involve?,"kill, mummify, and bury an animal","Apis,",bert,67afbc914b61ab64a2b134846a236640,What did the different form of worshiping animals in the Late Period involve?,"kill, mummify, and bury an animal","Apis, a sacred bull worshipped as a manifestation of the Memphite god Ptah,",bert,7f70e564ab430f4421706abba19698fa,What did the different form of worshiping animals in the Late Period involve?,"kill, mummify, and bury an animal",animals,bert,23b41a6a0e8488960f2cfd1e80d83be4,What did the different form of worshiping animals in the Late Period involve?,"kill, mummify, and bury an animal","kill, mummify, and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god.

"State schools in Somerset are provided by three local education authorities: Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, and the larger Somerset County Council. All state schools are comprehensive. In some areas primary, infant and junior schools cater for ages four to eleven, after which the pupils move on to secondary schools. There is a three-tier system of first, middle and upper schools in the Cheddar Valley, and in West Somerset, while most other schools in the county use the two-tier system. Somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools; Bath and North East Somerset has 13 state and 5 independent secondary schools; and North Somerset has 10 state and 2 independent secondary schools, excluding sixth form colleges. Some of the county's secondary schools have specialist school status. Some schools have sixth forms and others transfer their sixth formers to colleges. Several schools can trace their origins back many years, such as The Blue School in Wells and Richard Huish College in Taunton. Others have changed their names over the years such as Beechen Cliff School which was started in 1905 as the City of Bath Boys' School and changed to its present name in 1972 when the grammar school was amalgamated with a local secondary modern school, to form a comprehensive school. Many others were established and built since the Second World War. In 2006, 5,900 pupils in Somerset sat GCSE examinations, with 44.5% achieving 5 grades A-C including English and Maths (compared to 45.8% for England). Sexey's School is a state boarding school in Bruton that also takes day pupils from the surrounding area. The Somerset LEA also provides special schools such as Newbury Manor School, which caters for children aged between 10 and 17 with special educational needs. Provision for pupils with special educational needs is also made by the mainstream schools.",a578e6c2ae7321f3a248c67dc18543e0,What county's secondary schools have specialist school status?,Somerse,Bath and North East Somerset,bert,a6326f58c14f18832acdf519df8a9f52,What county's secondary schools have specialist school status?,Somerse,Bath and North East Somerset has 13 state and 5 independent secondary schools; and North Somerset,bert,e48cf91edaa472603991d5e5e077bf3b,What county's secondary schools have specialist school status?,Somerse,North Somerset,bert,2dfa3cde539cc196068d6669eef8155a,What county's secondary schools have specialist school status?,Somerse,Somerset,bert,3922cf0bab04d71219eeb18237e462c5,What county's secondary schools have specialist school status?,Somerse,Somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools; Bath and North East Somerset,bert,2beab88311696fd8cc1564c0f5e89efc,What county's secondary schools have specialist school status?,Somerse,Somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools; Bath and North East Somerset has 13 state and 5 independent secondary schools; and North Somerset,bert,2bbf165afaff4b585ed6527fe5314848,What has changed their names over the years?,Some schools,Beechen Cliff School,bert,8273194304b36920bb5e2b88c8aaa66f,What has changed their names over the years?,Some schools,Beechen Cliff School which was started in 1905 as the City of Bath Boys' School,bert,fa97a81328db10078ea8c6202fe2e956,What has changed their names over the years?,Some schools,Blue School in Wells and Richard Huish College in Taunton.

"Stefen ""Stef"" Djordjevic is a Serbian American high school defensive back who is gifted in both sports and academics. He is seeking a college football scholarship to escape the economically depressed small western Pennsylvania town of Ampipe and a dead-end job and life working at the mill like his father and brother Greg. He dreams of becoming an engineer right after he graduates from college. Ampipe is a company town whose economy is dominated by the town's main employer, American Pipe & Steel, a steel mill struggling through the downturn of the early 1980s recession. Stef gets through his days with the love of his girlfriend, Lisa Lietzke, and his strong bond with his teammates. Most of the film takes place after the big football game against undefeated Walnut Heights High School. Ampipe appears headed to win the game, when a fumbled handoff in the closing seconds—as well as Stefen's pass interference penalty earlier in the game—leads to a Walnut Heights victory. Following the game, Coach Burt Nickerson lambastes the fumbler in the locker room, telling him he ""quit"" the game. When Stefen retorts that the coach himself quit, the coach kicks him off the team. In the aftermath, disgruntled Ampipe fans vandalize Coach Nickerson's house and yard. Stefen is present and is a reluctant participant, but is nonetheless seen by Nickerson as the vandals flee. From there, Stefen deals with personal battles, including dealing with the coach blackballing him among colleges because of his attitude and participation in the desecration of Nickerson's yard and house.

Stefen gets in an argument with Lisa, and his best friend Brian declines a scholarship offer to USC and plans to marry his pregnant girlfriend.",7febaef828fbe38cab08112adde1962e,What's the first name of the person whose brother works with his father at the mill?,Stefen,"""Stef""",bert,2d19db880263715239ca98daab9a3d84,What's the first name of the person whose brother works with his father at the mill?,Stefen,"""Stef"" Djordjevic",bert,648d16ef67200753f4a071b27c380671,What's the first name of the person whose brother works with his father at the mill?,Stefen,"Stefen ""Stef""",bert,a937bd2bbdc49c2c4dc014cb92748393,What's the first name of the person whose brother works with his father at the mill?,Stefen,"Stefen ""Stef"" Djordjevic",bert,2077fef41039fd66b20e09ee787355f6,What's the nickname of the person who gets removed from the team after standing up to the coach?,Stef,"""Stef"" Djordjevic",bert,b9c7a363dee9d1b7b4a0adb0e1deb224,What's the nickname of the person who gets removed from the team after standing up to the coach?,Stef,Djordjevic,bert,402e5844fbe86d6d154f638c9df83f22,What's the nickname of the person who gets removed from the team after standing up to the coach?,Stef,Stefen,bert,4ada631783d06e53e88a8970407b3812,What's the nickname of the person who gets removed from the team after standing up to the coach?,Stef,"Stefen ""Stef""",bert,60b03967510a332fb355b88f45672440,What's the nickname of the person who gets removed from the team after standing up to the coach?,Stef,"Stefen ""Stef"" Djordjevic",bert,4c9680d8bf5f43ad39c97db894567fc4,Who causes Ampipe to lose the football game?,the fumbler,"""Stef""",bert,24e7c3f6d759b66b9fc444d69960e85d,Who causes Ampipe to lose the football game?,the fumbler,"""Stef"" Djordjevic",bert,b3b04e6466d5996df0938a917ac44cf6,Who causes Ampipe to lose the football game?,the fumbler,"Stef gets through his days with the love of his girlfriend, Lisa Lietzke,",bert,4aec99840133d0771cbddd2323ff3738,Who causes Ampipe to lose the football game?,the fumbler,"Stefen ""Stef""",bert,228179ff2f1fe02badd877f7eb27bf28,Who causes Ampipe to lose the football game?,the fumbler,"Stefen ""Stef"" Djordjevic",bert,95d6b2d7dca6047e1044433f747ba4f9,Who causes Ampipe to lose the football game?,the fumbler,"Stefen's pass interference penalty earlier in the game—leads to a Walnut Heights victory.

"Suddenly, London goes dark and loses all of its electricity.  There is commotion at a cinema, with people demanding their money back.  The owner of the cinema, Karl Verloc, enters through a back entrance to the living quarters above, and pretends to have been asleep and not know anything of the blackout.  His wife, Mrs. Verloc comes to get him and is surprised to see him, but he informs her that he had been sleeping the entire time.  He instructs his wife to return the money to the customers – against her protests – because he has ""some money coming in.""  As the money is about to be disbursed to the customers downstairs, the lights go back on.  It is revealed that sand was put in the boilers as an act of sabotage on London's electricity grid.   The next day, Verloc meets with his contact and it is revealed that he is part of a gang of terrorists from an unnamed European country who are planning a series of attacks in London, though their exact motives are not made clear. Verloc's contact is disappointed that the newspapers mocked the short loss of electricity, and instructs Verloc to place a parcel of ""fireworks"" at the Piccadilly London Underground station.  Verloc tells the contact that he is not comfortable with any act that would cause the loss of life. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard suspects Verloc's involvement in the plot and assigns Detective Sergeant Ted Spencer to investigate Verloc.  Spencer is initially undercover as a greengrocer's helper next to the cinema, and befriends Mrs. Verloc and her little brother, Stevie, who lives with them, by treating them to a fancy dinner.  At this point, Spencer and Scotland Yard are unsure whether Mrs. Verloc is complicit in the terrorist plots or merely innocently unaware.",1f4445dee024a52401ad541dec32fdc8,What is the last name of the person that Scotland yard assigns to the case?,Ted Spencer,Spencer,bert,e2a78b866e0ff92832a9fb5502e41b8b,What is the last name of the person that Scotland yard assigns to the case?,Ted Spencer,Spencer to investigate Verloc.,bert,8b5160b437ac506d8bdceddaa76e7e53,What is the last name of the person that Scotland yard assigns to the case?,Ted Spencer,Spencer to investigate Verloc.

"Switchboard operator Marie Lawson is conned by admirer Nicky, who tells her it is just a practical joke, into redirecting a phone call. However, Nicky uses what he learns to his own benefit, costing the intended recipient a lot of money. When the victim complains to Marie's boss, telephone repairmen Terry Riley and John are called in to see if the phone was tapped. When it is found not to be, Marie loses her job. Terry is attracted to Marie and eventually talks her into a date. He also gets her hired by businessman John P. Schuyler, whom he had earlier saved from a live electrical wire. When Marie runs into Nicky later, she lets slip that her new employer is expecting a delivery of $90,000 in bonds. As a result, Nicky is able to fool the courier into thinking he is Schuyler and giving him the bonds while Marie is distracted by a flood of calls from his accomplices. When she realizes what has happened, she goes looking for Nicky, but this only serves to make her look guilty. Terry is questioned by the police and then released so he can lead them to her hiding place. It works and she is arrested. When an expensive lawyer shows up on her behalf, Terry becomes suspicious and taps his line with John's reluctant help. Finally, he is able to trace a call to where Nicky and his gang are hiding out. When he goes there, he is easily caught and placed in a bedroom after the phone is ripped out. However, he is not searched. He hooks up a spare phone he has and is able to contact John to bring help.

"Tamara Riley is a shy and unattractive but intelligent teenage girl who likes witchcraft and has a crush on Bill Natolly, her handsome English teacher. When a critical article she writes about the school's athletes is published, two of the star athletes, Shawn and Patrick, want revenge. Tamara attempts to perform a magical ritual to bind her fate to that of her teacher, but when she must spill her own blood, she ceases the ritual. That night, a prank is orchestrated by Shawn and Patrick, along with Shawn's girlfriend Kisha. Shawn calls Tamara, impersonating Mr. Natolly, and invites her to a motel room. A video camera is placed there and catches Tamara undressing. Shawn, Patrick, and Kisha watch this, along with three others who did not know about the prank (Chloe, Jesse and Roger). Shawn comes in and taunts Tamara, and Tamara is accidentally killed in a struggle. Despite Chloe's demands that they inform the police, she is blackmailed into helping bury Tamara. However, they are shocked when Tamara walks into class, looking more attractive than ever before. They convince themselves that she was only unconscious and dug her way out of the ground.

"Teenager Elena Peters and her friends, Missy and Josh, go to a party. Elena witnesses her boyfriend, Brian, with another woman. She leaves the dance floor and enters an isolated room. There, she discovers a red trunk and opens it to find a severely injured Arkin O'Brien.

"Terri Griffith is an aspiring teenage journalist in Phoenix who feels that her teachers don't take her articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl. With her parents out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation, Terri decides to remedy the situation.

Along the way she meets Rick Morehouse, a nerd who becomes her pet project. After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls, Terri starts to fall for him. After many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as ""one of the guys"".

"The American Federation of Labor (AFL), a coalition of labor unions formed in the 1880s, vigorously opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe for moral, cultural, and racial reasons. The issue unified the workers who feared that an influx of new workers would flood the labor market and lower wages. Nativism was not a factor because upwards of half the union members were themselves immigrants or the sons of immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Britain. However, nativism was a factor when the AFL even more strenuously opposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its Euro-American members) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society. The AFL intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing immigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 Emergency Quota Act and the Immigration Act of 1924, and seeing that they were strictly enforced.Mink (1986) concludes that the link between the AFL and the Democratic Party rested in part on immigration issues, noting the large corporations, which supported the Republicans, wanted more immigration to augment their labor force.United Farm Workers during Cesar Chavez tenure was committed to restricting immigration. Chavez and Dolores Huerta, cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the Bracero Program that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964.

"The British Army conducted only relatively infrequent patrols along its sector of the inner German border, principally for training purposes and symbolic value. By the 1970s, it was carrying out only one patrol a month, only rarely using helicopters or ground surveillance radar and erecting no permanent observation posts. The British border zone was divided into two sectors covering a total distance of about 650 kilometres (400 mi) along the border. Unlike the Americans, the British did not assign specific units to border duty, but rotated the task between the divisions of the British Army of the Rhine.The border was also patrolled in the British sector by the British Frontier Service, the smallest of the Western border surveillance organisations. Its personnel served as a liaison between British military and political interests and the German agencies on the border. The BFS was disbanded in 1991 following Germany's reunification.The United States Army maintained a substantial and continuous military presence at the inner German border throughout the entire period from 1945 to after the end of the Cold War. Regular American soldiers manned the border from the end of the war until they were replaced in 1946 by the United States Constabulary, which was disbanded in 1952 after policing duties were transferred to the German authorities. It was replaced by three dedicated armoured cavalry regiments assigned to provide a permanent defence. The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment based at Bamberg, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment based at Nuremberg and the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment based at Fulda – later replaced by the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment – monitored the border using observation posts, ground and air patrols, countering intrusions and gathering intelligence on Warsaw Pact activities.",1a700d393609261e3cce4c668ee18709,What numbers were the armoured cavalry units that replaced the policing duties of the German authorities?,2nd,"United States Constabulary,",bert,8d3e7fd1455de519f28df188ba151a1e,What numbers were the armoured cavalry units that replaced the policing duties of the German authorities?,2nd,"United States Constabulary, which was disbanded in 1952 after policing duties were transferred to the German authorities.

"The British Parliament's efforts to levy new taxes following the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to taxation without representation was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others. Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year. After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution. Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.When the American Revolutionary War began, George Washington was selected to head the colonial army. During the war, the capital was moved to Richmond at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack. In 1781, the combined action of Continental and French land and naval forces trapped the British army on the Virginia Peninsula, where troops under George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown. His surrender on October 19, 1781 led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies.Virginians were instrumental in writing the United States Constitution. James Madison drafted the Virginia Plan in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1789. Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The three-fifths compromise ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the House of Representatives. Together with the Virginia dynasty of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. In 1790, both Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new District of Columbia, though the Virginian area was retroceded in 1846. Virginia is called the ""Mother of States"" because of its role in being carved into states such as Kentucky, which became the 15th state in 1792, and for the numbers of American pioneers born in Virginia.",b3b8b00fd766099ebabdb3ca946885aa,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,George Washington,bert,25e2fe5a55bfa137ccd5220d538cef8f,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,James,bert,19766da0171f9b256738de2712116bc1,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,Patrick,bert,f9f9106efd5781b1549eb2333ed1a3da,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,Patrick Henry and Richard,bert,050a97a99cf31eff011fb6a625f02bcb,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,Richard,bert,74eb7fde640c0821d5fbf894ababb938,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis,bert,b8f49381461d17a02cbc13962bc07434,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,Cornwallis,bert,fa5158caf2a2f06f26d485f648f6a19f,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,George Washington,bert,705670745a334a6fc38ffc990f49fb3e,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau,bert,1af7cc31efdcfa85d21f25faae217707,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis,bert,f75b5ad3057ab137fcefeb8deefbab65,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Convention of 1833 (April 1–13, 1833), a political gathering of settlers in Mexican Texas, was a successor to the Convention of 1832, whose requests had not been addressed by the Mexican government. Despite the political uncertainty resulting from a recently concluded civil war, 56 delegates met in San Felipe de Austin to draft a series of petitions to the Government of Mexico. The volatile William H. Wharton presided over the meeting.  Although the convention's agenda largely mirrored that of the Convention of 1832, delegates also agreed to pursue independent statehood for the province, which was at the time part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas. Under the guidance of Sam Houston, former governor of the US state of Tennessee, a committee drafted a state constitution to submit to the Mexican Congress. The proposed constitution was largely patterned on US political principles, yet retained several Spanish customs.  Delegates also requested customs exemptions and asked that a ban on immigration into Texas be lifted. Some residents complained that this convention, like its predecessor, was illegal.  Nevertheless, Stephen F. Austin journeyed to Mexico City to present the petitions to the government. Frustrated with the lack of progress, in October Austin wrote a letter encouraging Texans to form their own state government.  This letter was forwarded to the Mexican government and Austin was imprisoned in early 1834.  During his imprisonment, the federal and state legislatures later passed a series of measures to placate the colonists, including the introduction of trial by jury.  Austin acknowledged that ""[e]very evil complained of has been remedied.""",830d3d26aacc5f7c43f87bb697754906,What state did the former governor of Tennessee help create a constitution??,Texas,"Mexican Texas,",bert,ef973d433924dba016c8022a2a1eee85,What state did the former governor of Tennessee help create a constitution??,Texas,The Convention of 1833,bert,5f5ff38e9e4436b7078e02336ae04c60,What state did the former governor of Tennessee help create a constitution??,Texas,"The Convention of 1833 (April 1–13, 1833), a political gathering of settlers in Mexican Texas,",bert,29e0722d5285750012ad703452110fa0,What state did the former governor of Tennessee help create a constitution??,Texas,"US state of Tennessee,",bert,dc96dc64b216acfa02291a98d1661b89,What was the preceding convention to the one that was presided over by a volatile person?,Convention of 1832,1833,bert,c68d3044193c37c2345e0c1344911788,What was the preceding convention to the one that was presided over by a volatile person?,Convention of 1832,Convention of 1833,bert,1d8a00323b048c07cc910e3e955608d7,What was the preceding convention to the one that was presided over by a volatile person?,Convention of 1832,"Convention of 1833 (April 1–13, 1833), a political gathering of settlers in Mexican Texas, was a successor to the Convention of 1832,",bert,70856568854cbfe1d5110f3479e4bee9,What was the preceding convention to the one that was presided over by a volatile person?,Convention of 1832,The Convention of,bert,bf737d1a97415148dbbada3289c608cc,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,Mexico City,bert,ef482e6b641ef07c3f90cb841291dab2,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,Mexico City to present the petitions to the government.,bert,a64fb4a2c564aa7fdea246a8511ac2c6,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,San Felipe de Austin,bert,2660e48e5420a88a2266509519bc7c10,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,San Felipe de Austin to draft a series of petitions to the Government of Mexico.,bert,070a7ed2cd9a3f49ccf1da47f994f792,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,the Mexican Congress.,bert,c60d8e7b9c94942edc7e7d89f8522f38,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,the government,bert,450698b0179bccda830ae76017591196,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Fredonian Rebellion (December 21, 1826 – January 23, 1827) was the first attempt by Anglo  settlers in Texas to secede from Mexico.  The settlers, led by Empresario Haden Edwards, declared independence from Mexican Texas and created the Republic of Fredonia near Nacogdoches. The short-lived republic encompassed the land the Mexican government had granted to Edwards in 1825 and included areas that had been previously settled.  Edwards's actions soon alienated the established residents, and the increasing hostilities between them and settlers recruited by Edwards led Victor Blanco of the Mexican government to revoke Edwards's contract. In late December 1826, a group of Edwards's supporters took control of the region by arresting and removing from office several municipality officials affiliated with the established residents.  Supporters declared their independence from Mexico.  Although the nearby Cherokee tribe initially signed a treaty to support the new republic because a prior agreement with the Mexican government negotiated by Chief Richard Fields was ignored, overtures from Mexican authorities and respected Empresario Stephen F. Austin convinced tribal leaders to repudiate the rebellion.  On January 31, 1827, a force of over 100 Mexican soldiers and 275 militiamen from Austin's colony marched into Nacogdoches to restore order.  Haden Edwards and his brother Benjamin Edwards fled to the United States. Chief Richard Fields was killed by his own tribe.  A local merchant was arrested and sentenced to death but later paroled. The rebellion led Mexican President Guadalupe Victoria to increase the military presence in the area. As a result, several hostile tribes in the area halted their raids on settlements and agreed to a peace treaty. The Comanche abided by this treaty for many years. Fearing that through the rebellion, the United States hoped to gain control of Texas, the Mexican government severely curtailed immigration to the region from the US. The new immigration law was bitterly opposed by colonists and caused increasing dissatisfaction with Mexican rule. Some historians consider the Fredonian Rebellion to be the beginning of the Texas Revolution.  In the words of one historian, the rebellion was ""premature, but it sparked the powder for later success.""",e188234d20a0104b9f37cb0b5aa79d9c,What is the full name of the person who soon alienated the established residents?,Haden Edwards,"Anglo settlers in Texas to secede from Mexico.

"The Georgetown Car Barn is a historic building in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in the United States. Designed by the architect Waddy Butler Wood, it was built between 1895 and 1897 by the Capital Traction Company as a union terminal for several Washington and Virginia streetcar lines. The adjacent Exorcist steps, later named after their appearance in William Friedkin's 1973 horror film The Exorcist, were built during the initial construction to connect M Street with Prospect Street. Intended for dual use as a passenger station and as a storage house for the streetcars, the Car Barn began Washington's only cable car system. Almost immediately after the building opened, the system was electrified and the Car Barn was converted to accommodate electric streetcars. Throughout its history as a terminal and storage facility, the Car Barn was never utilized to the extent anticipated by its construction. The building has undergone several renovations, the most extensive in 1911, when the original Romanesque Revival façade was significantly modified and the interior was almost completely gutted. Not long after its opening, the building fell into disrepair. Changing ownership over time, it maintained its original function of housing streetcars until 1950, when it was redeveloped as office space. Among its occupants was the International Police Academy, an arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, which operated out of the Car Barn in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, it is used as an academic building by Georgetown University.",e0b7f85674e2729ad3bd2197b8ab157c,In what year was the Georgetown Car Barn construction complete?,1897,1911,bert,7baeb73047c5b8b275d80af7e8ef0777,In what year was the Georgetown Car Barn construction complete?,1897,1950,bert,4eb45bfc85cdafc5dd1965b3d2763831,In what year was the Georgetown Car Barn construction complete?,1897,1960s and 1970s,bert,62ae4bdc8d18342b626896ce057b8697,In what year was the Georgetown Car Barn construction complete?,1897,1970s,bert,b5ea02d11a17c4e1435a6e484785167b,In what year was the Georgetown Car Barn construction complete?,1897,1973,bert,69090b6fe57c9469233390f30a676c77,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Greek text on the Rosetta Stone provided the starting point. Ancient Greek was widely known to scholars, but they were not familiar with details of its use in the Hellenistic period as a government language in Ptolemaic Egypt; large-scale discoveries of Greek papyri were a long way in the future. Thus, the earliest translations of the Greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling with the historical context and with administrative and religious jargon. Stephen Weston verbally presented an English translation of the Greek text at a Society of Antiquaries meeting in April 1802.Meanwhile, two of the lithographic copies made in Egypt had reached the Institut de France in Paris in 1801. There, librarian and antiquarian Gabriel de La Porte du Theil set to work on a translation of the Greek, but he was dispatched elsewhere on Napoleon's orders almost immediately, and he left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon. Ameilhon produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803, in both Latin and French to ensure that they would circulate widely. At Cambridge, Richard Porson worked on the missing lower right corner of the Greek text. He produced a skilful suggested reconstruction, which was soon being circulated by the Society of Antiquaries alongside its prints of the inscription. At almost the same moment, Christian Gottlob Heyne in Göttingen was making a new Latin translation of the Greek text that was more reliable than Ameilhon's, which was first published in 1803. It was reprinted by the Society of Antiquaries in a special issue of its journal Archaeologia in 1811, alongside Weston's previously unpublished English translation, Colonel Turner's narrative, and other documents.",c038f80042a3870f5e2ad41f46549b8d,What is the first name of the person who had a previously unpublished English translation?,Stephen,Christian,bert,42de6ff82573b5829a863f22b9ce0b83,What is the first name of the person who had a previously unpublished English translation?,Stephen,Hubert-Pascal,bert,76d3a43a7574d7344313a16ab13ac0d1,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Gabriel de La Porte,bert,514af99747802718c7e8ba31b41978ec,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Gabriel de La Porte du,bert,c86158f6119d7e343c228d5d848ac4a3,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon.,bert,436cb8404ac9f688d27b143211b4802f,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Stephen Weston,bert,482f4f9f5820661cd7efe99f450d4363,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Weston,bert,1abea329ba8cbdae60e5b1c0f4034f8a,What is the full name of the person who produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Christian Gottlob Heyne,bert,312b95dc23d7ef26f7257df52cd531f5,What is the full name of the person who produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,bert,0f873469d0b03852633f0eee6022c26c,What is the full name of the person who produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Richard Porson,bert,88ffc16c8240d7c64151304c9c7481ec,What is the full name of the person who produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Stephen Weston,bert,259b08efcae0579a2c2946141d73ac60,What was the full name of the person who Christian Gottlob Heyne's translation was more reliable than?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,bert,2e80f5c0a5927cdee247de23e9487b61,What was the full name of the person who Christian Gottlob Heyne's translation was more reliable than?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Hubert-Pascal,bert,5ba4c32f5fdf823d48fe531b354440b4,What was the full name of the person who Christian Gottlob Heyne's translation was more reliable than?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Richard Porson,bert,97657ae6032e19bf2ed8c53d5587687c,What was the full name of the person who Christian Gottlob Heyne's translation was more reliable than?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Stephen Weston,bert,4704ea528369cdc0464ddcd930c6d7e2,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Hudson Valley Rail Trail is a paved 4-mile (6.4 km) east–west rail trail in the town of Lloyd in Ulster County, New York, stretching from the Hudson River through the hamlet of Highland. The trail was originally part of the Poughkeepsie Bridge Route, a rail corridor that crossed the Hudson via the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Controlled by a variety of railroads throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the bridge was damaged and became unusable after a 1974 fire. By the 1980s the corridor's then-owner, Conrail, had routed all rail traffic in the region north through Selkirk, and was eager to relieve itself of the bridge and adjoining rights-of-way. In 1984, it sold the entire property for one dollar to a felon who did not maintain it or pay taxes on it. The section of the corridor west of the Hudson was seized by Ulster County in 1991 and transferred to the town of Lloyd. During the 1990s, a broadband utility seeking to lay fiber optic cable paid the town to pass through the former corridor. The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of the trail was supported by a local Rotary club, which built a pavilion along the trail. The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose. While the trail originally ended at Route 44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route 9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding. The bridge, now a pedestrian walkway called Walkway Over the Hudson, connects the trail with the Dutchess Rail Trail to the east, creating a 30-mile (48 km) rail trail system that spans the Hudson. The trail is expected to be extended west, where it will border Route 299. As it passes through Highland, the trail is carried by several bridges, connects to four parking areas, and traverses a wetlands complex.

Even though they were the first of the new Spy Kids Division, they are not considered the top spy kids, and soon they face particularly difficult competition from Gary and Gerti Giggles, the children of double-dealing agent Donnagon Giggles, whom Carmen and Juni helped to rescue in the previous film. It is shown that Carmen defends Gary, and has a crush on him, which strains her relationship with Juni. At a gala event, Donnagon somehow hacks into the teleprompter which the president was reading from, and is named director of the OSS. A fight ensues when a group of Magna Men arrive and render all adults unconscious. They are after the ""Transmooker"", a highly coveted device which can shut off all electronic devices. Juni recovers it, but drops it when Gary tries to take it from him. Gary then frames Juni for the loss, resulting in Juni being fired. In his new position as director, Donnagon can carry on with his plan to steal the Transmooker, so he can rule the world. The next morning Carmen hacks into the database and reinstates Juni as an agent. They take a mission meant for Gary and Gerti to recover the Transmooker. She and Juni use some hints from Alexander Minion, and follow the trail to a mysterious island where all electronics refuse to work. Gary and Gerti meanwhile are sent to the Gobi Desert and while trying to pinpoint their position manage to fall into a pit of feces. Shortly after arriving Carmen and Juni meet Romero, a lunatic scientist. Romero has been attempting to create genetically-miniaturized animals, so he can make a profit by selling the animals to kids in ""miniature zoos."" He had an experiment go wrong after accidentally pouring growth concoction onto the mutated set of animals. As a result, he is unwilling to leave his lab, out of fear of being eaten.",eb45e4514f17cddf90b80da984ea83b4,Where do Gary and Gerti fall into a pit of feces?,Gobi Desert,a mysterious island,bert,81af8d04bd9c90777d9b5f0fcbc2be5f,Where do Gary and Gerti fall into a pit of feces?,Gobi Desert,a mysterious island where all electronics refuse to work.

"The Rosetta Stone is listed as ""a stone of black granodiorite, bearing three inscriptions ... found at Rosetta"" in a contemporary catalogue of the artefacts discovered by the French expedition and surrendered to British troops in 1801. At some period after its arrival in London, the inscriptions on the stone were coloured in white chalk to make them more legible, and the remaining surface was covered with a layer of carnauba wax designed to protect the Rosetta Stone from visitors' fingers. This gave a dark colour to the stone that led to its mistaken identification as black basalt. These additions were removed when the stone was cleaned in 1999, revealing the original dark grey tint of the rock, the sparkle of its crystalline structure, and a pink vein running across the top left corner. Comparisons with the Klemm collection of Egyptian rock samples showed a close resemblance to rock from a small granodiorite quarry at Gebel Tingar on the west bank of the Nile, west of Elephantine in the region of Aswan; the pink vein is typical of granodiorite from this region.The Rosetta Stone is 1,123 millimetres (3 ft 8 in) high at its highest point, 757 mm (2 ft 5.8 in) wide, and 284 mm (11 in) thick. It weighs approximately 760 kilograms (1,680 lb). It bears three inscriptions: the top register in Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the second in the Egyptian Demotic script, and the third in Ancient Greek. The front surface is polished and the inscriptions lightly incised on it; the sides of the stone are smoothed, but the back is only roughly worked, presumably because this would have not been visible when it was erected.",074ebfc9e5352ad2a558edad27a0777c,How many kilograms does the Rosetta Stone weigh?,760,"1,680",bert,0105517c3db2dca8b012d54a46232114,How many kilograms does the Rosetta Stone weigh?,760,"1,680 lb",bert,142921f82d93fe60d0668eca81728bfe,How many kilograms does the Rosetta Stone weigh?,760,760 kilograms,bert,b4cdb0627ac34f28cd3102dd09621f87,How many kilograms does the Rosetta Stone weigh?,760,"760 kilograms (1,680",bert,7bf12f131cafbe86402dc981e7d720fd,How many kilograms does the Rosetta Stone weigh?,760,"760 kilograms (1,680 lb",bert,a01230173c3aac420146183c9e164985,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature length film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era. After World War I, Hollywood monopolised the industry, and by the 1960s Australian film production had effectively ceased. With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of national identity, such as Wake in Fright and Gallipoli, while Crocodile Dundee and the Ozploitation movement's Mad Max series became international blockbusters. In a film market flooded with foreign content, Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in 2015. The AACTAs are Australia's premier film and television awards, and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger.Australia has two public broadcasters (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service), three commercial television networks, several pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has at least one daily newspaper, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review. In 2010, Reporters Without Borders placed Australia 18th on a list of 178 countries ranked by press freedom, behind New Zealand (8th) but ahead of the United Kingdom (19th) and United States (20th). This relatively low ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia; most print media are under the control of News Corporation and Fairfax Media.",63c95eaddf0348142df714778f6d5383,What are the names of the two public broadcasters in Australia?,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,"(the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service),",bert,884191e40cd03d86f4b911f64abc329f,What are the names of the two public broadcasters in Australia?,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Broadcasting Corporation,bert,0654cd39337ac8ae23e081a06d07a09b,What are the names of the two public broadcasters in Australia?,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Corporation,bert,e9ac54b96a1c9eef92f9a66c9850a75e,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Symphony No. 3, Op. 36, also known as the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs (Polish: Symfonia pieśni żałosnych), is a symphony in three movements composed by Henryk Górecki in Katowice, Poland, between October and December 1976. The work is indicative of the transition between Górecki's dissonant earlier manner and his more tonal later style and ""represented a stylistic breakthrough: austerely plaintive, emotionally direct and steeped in medieval modes."" It was premièred on 4 April 1977, at the Royan International Festival, with Stefania Woytowicz as soprano and Ernest Bour as conductor.A solo soprano sings Polish texts in each of the three movements. The first is a 15th-century Polish lament of Mary, mother of Jesus, the second a message written on the wall of a Gestapo cell during World War II, and the third a Silesian folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans in the Silesian uprisings. The first and third movements are written from the perspective of a parent who has lost a child, and the second movement from that of a child separated from a parent. The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation through war. Until 1992, Górecki was known only to connoisseurs, primarily as one of several composers from the Polish School responsible for the postwar Polish music renaissance. That year, Elektra-Nonesuch released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the London Sinfonietta, that topped the classical charts in Britain and the United States. To date, it has sold more than a million copies, vastly exceeding the expected lifetime sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th-century composer. This success, however, has not generated similar interest in Górecki's other works.",16845beb7b6b05d96d44bfeed54737fa,In what year did the London Sinfonietta perform Henry Gorecki's symphony?,1992,1976,bert,d36e4736a011f371c707598bf718b279,In what year did the London Sinfonietta perform Henry Gorecki's symphony?,1992,1977,bert,0215ace4b88a074213a14e7a87254b85,In what year did the London Sinfonietta perform Henry Gorecki's symphony?,1992,October,bert,b20ab346e7b4af0ed1765a550b370659,In what year did the London Sinfonietta perform Henry Gorecki's symphony?,1992,October and December 1976.,bert,7c7c08e03b449af3ed438c04cb72c818,In what year did the London Sinfonietta perform Henry Gorecki's symphony?,1992,"Until 1992,",bert,842a692d0419306bfd3f1eeb326425f9,What is the alternative name of the symphony that premiered on 4 April?,Symphony of Sorrowful Songs,3,bert,55ccfdc442e9257dda68a907e02afb70,What is the alternative name of the symphony that premiered on 4 April?,Symphony of Sorrowful Songs,"3, Op. 36,",bert,a7cb44dc3ac46aa332e259432c7e0ddc,What is the alternative name of the symphony that premiered on 4 April?,Symphony of Sorrowful Songs,"Symphony No. 3,",bert,240053215dff3d2288a1736601400fef,What is the alternative name of the symphony that premiered on 4 April?,Symphony of Sorrowful Songs,"Symphony No. 3, Op. 36,",bert,384bcdcfbf5593163770d465daa07b69,What was the name of the label that released a recording of the Symphony No 3?,Elektra-Nonesuch,Elektra-Nonesuch released,bert,8d6505222549890636fb146d41a13686,What was the name of the label that released a recording of the Symphony No 3?,Elektra-Nonesuch,Elektra-Nonesuch released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the London,bert,a2743e93efde00ef4c0a11e2fc617716,What was the name of the label that released a recording of the Symphony No 3?,Elektra-Nonesuch,"Elektra-Nonesuch released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the London Sinfonietta,",bert,639a8f7067f7d8d67c66da0d5f2e226b,What was the name of the label that released a recording of the Symphony No 3?,Elektra-Nonesuch,"London Sinfonietta,",bert,7cfa503743cb33e126ba42386dbec660,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The Valley View house is about 1 mile (1.6 km) northwest of downtown Romney, atop a promontory (known locally as the Yellow Banks) where Depot Valley joins the South Branch Potomac River valley. Depot Valley runs 0.5 miles (0.8 km) from West Sioux Lane in Romney to Valley View, and an unnamed tributary of Big Run flows north along its bottom. Depot Valley Road parallels the stream.Depot Valley is named for Romney Depot, located at the end of a former spur of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) South Branch line near the intersection of present-day West Sioux Lane and Depot Valley Road. The unincorporated area around the depot was once known as Valley. A post office operated there from 1928 until 1937, when its mail was routed through Romney; it is assumed that Valley View farm used it, since it was 0.5 miles (0.8 km) south of the house.The Valley View farm property adjoins the Wappocomo farm on the northeast, the corporate limits of Romney on the east and south and the Yellow Banks on the west. As well as Valley View's 6.63-acre (2.68 ha) tract, the Mayhew family owns agricultural land rich in alluvial soils along the South Branch Potomac River west of the house. The South Branch Valley Railroad bisects this farmland, crossing the South Branch Potomac River via a wooden trestle.Valley View Island, an island in the South Branch Potomac River just north of the mouth of Sulphur Spring Run, is approximately 0.5 miles (0.8 km) southwest of the Valley View house. Both the house and the island are owned by the Mayhew family. The island is ringed by forests, with agricultural fields in its center. When Lots Number 17 and 19 of the Northern Neck Proprietary South Branch Survey were surveyed in 1749 and resurveyed in 1788, the island belonged to Lot Number 19. At that time, the river flowed east of the island, along the base of the Yellow Banks; its course later changed to run around the west side of the island.Mill Creek Mountain, a narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, rises westward from the South Branch Potomac River across from Valley View. The western foothills of South Branch Mountain rise to the east.

"The centrifuge process was regarded as the only promising separation method in April 1942. Jesse Beams had developed such a process at the University of Virginia during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with uranium hexafluoride, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.Scaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with 1-meter (3 ft 3 in) rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with 4-meter (13 ft) rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting, and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required. Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work on a series of improvements which promised to increase the efficiency of the process. However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant. In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee following a recommendation by Conant, Nichols and August C. Klein of Stone & Webster.",785226d65daa2f34cf1105f3f4e70613,What are the first names of the two people who began work on a series of improvements with Urey which promised to increase the efficiency of the process?,Karl,Beams,bert,63f03aeb88540f5b0328f2731f601b13,What are the first names of the two people who began work on a series of improvements with Urey which promised to increase the efficiency of the process?,Karl,"Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required.

"The double album The Wall was written almost entirely by Waters and is largely based on his life story. Having sold over 23 million RIAA certified units in the US as of 2013, is one of the top three bestselling albums of all time in America, according to RIAA. Pink Floyd hired Bob Ezrin to co-produce the album and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe to illustrate the sleeve art. The band embarked on The Wall Tour of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of The Wall was on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.In March 1983, the last Waters–Gilmour–Mason collaboration, The Final Cut, was released. The album was subtitled: ""A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd"". Waters wrote all the album's lyrics and music. His lyrics were critical of the Conservative Party government of the day and mention Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by name. At the time Gilmour did not have any new material, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour's name ""disappeared"" from the production credits, though he retained his pay. Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder describing it as ""a superlative achievement"" and ""art rock's crowning masterpiece"".

At the 1-mile (1.6 km) mark, the trail reaches a bridge over Vineyard Avenue. About 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the bridge, the trail crosses under New Paltz Road. Almost 0.5 miles (0.80 km) from this road, the trail reaches the Black Creek Wetlands Complex. Black Creek is one of the two ""principal streams"" to run through Lloyd; it bisects the town as it flows north and pools in a pond. The wetlands complex itself is important for water drainage. Part of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation region 3, the complex contains Plutarch Swamp and one of the region's largest dwarf shrub bogs, hosting a variety of rare species. The complex also includes the Swarte Kill, Lloyd's second major waterway. The trail continues an additional 0.5-mile (0.80 km) past the beginning of the complex to Tony Williams Park.There are four parking areas along the trail, by Haviland Road, Commercial Avenue, the Rotary pavilion, and at Tony Williams Park. The trail is 12 feet (3.7 m) wide and 4 miles (6.4 km) long; it is paved with asphalt and suitable for hiking, bicycling, horseback riding, roller blading, and cross country skiing.In 2018, Hudson Valley law firm Mainetti & Mainetti, P.C. published an updated bicycle map that showed the proposed route of the Hudson Valley Rail Trail, and how it links the Walkill Valley Rail Trail and River-to-Ridge-Trail with the Dutchess County Rail Trail.",64921d52e1eea6791620cfbe4cc4ba0d,How wide in feet is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,12 feet,12,bert,fa6c658453916a71e429f0fff98b0c2e,How wide in feet is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,12 feet,12 feet (3,bert,f19a2ce987b487e4c20734c7f50bcc69,How wide in feet is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,12 feet,12 feet (3.7,bert,944e64a0d873185bdb09e01b7cff7ff4,How wide in feet is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,12 feet,12 feet (3.7 m,bert,669658a7bb2ec7a7a1bb94307015fb15,How wide in feet is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,12 feet,3.7 m,bert,18d0dbd5568077c64c836a1babc617d2,How wide in meters is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,3.7 m,12,bert,3a4b2bd13ed825834e389f450355aa43,How wide in meters is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,3.7 m,12 feet,bert,1f4fc4ec9ff6580838e23031f5fad995,How wide in meters is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,3.7 m,12 feet (3,bert,0499c3889821a8af07cf5abd4aa4f4c3,How wide in meters is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,3.7 m,12 feet (3.7,bert,e40971880e628067ad77513847f2e9c5,How wide in meters is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,3.7 m,12 feet (3.7 m,bert,3c7d1f93398b9b0b93dd86e64224228f,What is the total length in kilometers is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,6.4 km,18.2,bert,04cbd6188c04f0ad0ad4166de72b1d5d,What is the total length in kilometers is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,6.4 km,18.2-mile,bert,82e4edc41c7482f26385ec4a124ac4ec,What is the total length in kilometers is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,6.4 km,18.2-mile (29.3,bert,a749b5eb2c25b4cfcde4d971964adc85,What is the total length in kilometers is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,6.4 km,29.3,bert,6735ef72416b7153f231bc5d6bed5962,What is the total length in kilometers is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,6.4 km,6.4,bert,f7a4bbc2002633bf4ea306b4f39e2110,What is the total length in miles is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,4 miles,18.2,bert,143993fa86c6c56c5f9d0afc731e083a,What is the total length in miles is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,4 miles,4 miles (6.4,bert,64578e72a03d8510cc227c40257635e2,What is the total length in miles is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,4 miles,4 miles (6.4 km,bert,298d31aa87d6a725e16101480a99afc0,What is the total length in miles is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,4 miles,6.4,bert,0e729f49c174e50dc3b34aa191edcfa4,What is the total length in miles is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,4 miles,6.4 km,bert,c3e5a1c154ca86b7ca1d03153ef16a86
"The economy of Dawson Creek is based on four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has historically been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and sweet clover. The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, where there is no provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format chain stores. Dawson Creek has a large tourism industry as Mile ""0"" of the Alaska Highway. Thousands of people drive on the highway every year, starting in Dawson Creek and ending in Fairbanks, Alaska. The trek is often made with recreational vehicles, sometimes in convoys which gather in the city. In the winter, the hospitality industry caters to workers from the oil patches. Discoveries south of Dawson Creek and higher energy prices have spurred oil and gas activities, which have in turn driven the nearby Fort St. John economy to spill over to the Dawson Creek economy. British Columbia's first wind farm, Bear Mountain Wind Park, was constructed southwest of the city in 2009.",661a0cc9fc921887e91f745c9e0da0f3,What is the name of the highway thousands of people drive on every year?,the Alaska Highway,Highway.,bert,320c7584e17db7cc19e6561e382a5306,What is the name of the highway thousands of people drive on every year?,the Alaska Highway,"Mile ""0""",bert,6a29412c85eeebefe34d4b5265fa039a,What is the name of the highway thousands of people drive on every year?,the Alaska Highway,"Mile ""0"" of the Alaska",bert,253f40a333c68d7d1cd93f5137249718,What is the name of the highway thousands of people drive on every year?,the Alaska Highway,"Mile ""0"" of the Alaska Highway.",bert,5f3b70be80c77eac6ef0241f7a78e466,What type of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years?,retail leakage,large-format retail stores,bert,1e08cd599d1e0d86a6d256618c411b95,What type of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years?,retail leakage,sales tax,bert,cb75e2672aae83cdb8adf2570b263f93,What type of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years?,retail leakage,sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%,bert,666c512df4282c19ba7db3cc344bd7b5,What type of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years?,retail leakage,the introduction of large-format retail stores,bert,fed0a073f7f93ef63a504ac9e8b25098,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The film begins with Francisco Francis running in the jungle with his family while soldiers are shooting and killing people around them.  The scene changes to an office building where Tony Green is speaking to Bruce in Clearbec corporate offices telling him that Francisco had broken into the local offices and stolen their files. As he converses with Bruce, he orders Renaldo, a young aide in his office, to hurry. Renaldo and Tony leave the local offices amid gunfire and chaos, but pause when a woman shouts at Renaldo. She is his mother; she is shot and killed by soldiers as Renaldo looks on. Tony shows his corporate ID to the soldiers and pulls Renaldo into his car. As they attempt to leave the city, they stop at a road block and watch soldiers gun down an unarmed man. Renaldo jumps out of the car and escapes the carnage. The scene changes to Jack Begosian speaking to call-ins on his radio program in Toronto, Canada, Atlanta, Georgia and Los Angeles, California discussing his pessimism about the government and his faith in the goodness of humankind.

"The film begins with a mock newsreel sequence showing the chaos around the death of 31-year-old film star Rudolph Valentino. Thousands of fans mob the funeral home until order is restored, at which point the important women in Valentino's life come to mourn. Each remembers him via flashbacks. The first of these women Bianca de Saulles who knew Valentino when he was a  taxi dancer, and gigolo in New York City. He shares with her his dream of owning an orange grove in California.  After mobsters rob him, he decides he must make the move west.   Next is a young movie executive and screenwriter named June Mathis, who has an unrequited love for Valentino. She first meets Valentino in California, where he upsets Mr. Fatty by grabbing the starlet next to Arbuckle and romancing her into becoming his first wife, Jean Acker. Acker's glamorous and luxurious life, made possible by acting in movies, motivates Valentino to try acting himself. Mathis recalls seeing him in a bit part in a movie and, based on that alone, recommending him for a larger role in her next project, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The hugely successful 1921 film launches Valentino to superstardom, and she is proud to have discovered him. Back at the funeral, Alla Nazimova makes a flamboyant entrance.  She proceeds to make a scene and, when the photographers ask her to repeat it for the cameras, she obliges.

"The film begins with the bear family sleeping peacefully at home, when suddenly, the alarms of dozens of clocks located on Junyer Bear's table go off. Papa Bear wakes up completely and runs to try to turn them off. Junyer excitedly wakes up and exclaims: ""Oh, boy! At last the great day has come at last! Oh, boy!"" Papa Bear asks how to stop the alarms, and his son simply shushes the clocks. Dad gets angry and smacks a clock in Junyer's face. Mom replies: ""But, Henry ...""  Henry shouts: ""Well! What do you Want!?"" To which Mom replies: ""It's Father's Day, Dear.""

"The film begins with the return of a group of friends consisting of Tanis Half-Elven, Sturm Brightblade, Caramon Majere, Raistlin Majere, Flint Fireforge, Tasslehoff Burrfoot. Kitiara Uth Matar, the half sister of the twins Caramon and Raistlin, was supposed to be there as well, but for reasons unexplained at the time could only send a mysterious note. The Companions had separated five years previously to pursue their own quests.On the eve of their reunion, the Companions discover that Solace, the village where many of them made their home, is very different from the peaceful village they had left five years previous. Solace has been taken over by a religious order called the Seekers. They are collaborating with the Dragon Highlords who are preparing for the conquest of the continent of Ansalon. Solace is now an armed camp as hobgoblin soldiers patrol the once peaceful village. Tanis, Flint and Tasslehoff meet up outside of Solace, and as they enter the village, they are accosted by Fewmaaster Toede: a hobgoblin commander, and some of his minions. Forced to fight, the threesome kill Toede's minions, and continue to the Inn of the Last Home to meet up with their friends, and, as circumstance would have it, two barbarians, Riverwind and Goldmoon. Kitiara Uth Matar is absent, having sent a letter to Tanis saying that ""her new lord is keeping her busy"". The Companions soon discover that the Seekers are searching for a Blue Crystal Staff. When Hederick, a Seeker, is accidentally burnt when Riverwind pushes him into the fireplace, Goldmoon heals him with her Blue Crystal Staff, a holy artifact of the goddess Mishakal which possesses healing powers. Upon seeing Goldmoon with the item he had been searching for, Hederick calls for the guards, causing the Companions to flee Solace.

"The film concerns the residents of a large terraced house in London between Christmas 1938 and September 1939. Among them are the landlady, Mrs Vizzard (played by Joyce Carey), who is a widow and a believer in spiritualism; Mrs Josser, Mr Josser and their teenage daughter; the eccentric spiritualist medium Mr Squales; the colourful Connie Coke, the young motor mechanic Percy Boon and his mother. Percy is in love with the Jossers' daughter and turns to crime to raise money to impress her with, but he bungles a car theft and finds himself accused of murder. Mr Josser digs into his retirement fund to hire the boy a lawyer. Mr Squales testifies against Percy, but in the process exposes to his fiancée Mrs Vizzard the fakeness of his claims to be able to contact the dead and to predict the future. Percy is found guilty, but his neighbours rally to his defence. With the assistance of Mr Josser's staunchly socialist Uncle Henry they gather thousands of signatures on a petition to gain him a reprieve. At the end of the film Percy's supporters march through the rain to Parliament, only to discover just before their arrival that clemency has already been granted.",e41ad5a293e1b2027e6465bd40e3bedd,What is the first name of the person who is accused of murder?,Percy,Mr Squales;,bert,b4db252fd2d14971d34f54e935452308,What is the first name of the person who is accused of murder?,Percy,"Mr Squales; the colourful Connie Coke, the young motor mechanic Percy",bert,ece8042c3d91927913a94f5de6ef2c71,What is the first name of the person who is accused of murder?,Percy,"Mr Squales; the colourful Connie Coke, the young motor mechanic Percy Boon and his mother.

"The film follows the personal relationship between a father, Arkady Shapira, his terminally ill wife Irina, and his two sons, Joshua and Reuben (Roth and Furlong). Joshua, the elder, is a hit-man for the Jewish-Russian mafia in Brooklyn and estranged from his family. After finishing a contract killing, Joshua is ordered to kill an Iranian jeweler in Brighton Beach, which Joshua reluctantly accepts. Joshua stands outside his family's apartment, where he is spotted by one of his old friends Sasha, who tells Joshua's brother Reuben the next day. Reuben goes to the hotel where Joshua is staying to see him. Joshua asks Reuben how he knew he was in Brighton, and they make plans to meet again the next day. Joshua waits near the boardwalk where Sasha is and intimidates him to tell who else knows about Joshua being in Brighton. Sasha brings Joshua to the car repair stand where Viktor and Yuri are. Joshua says they will help him find the Iranian jeweler and when they refuse, Joshua threatens them. After things go sour, Joshua executes a man at a phone booth to prevent being found out in Brighton, which angers the neighborhood boss Boris Volkoff. Joshua starts dating his ex-girlfriend Alla. Alla asks Reuben if he has seen Joshua anywhere and the three go together to see a movie. Eventually Reuben takes Joshua home to see his parents again, but Arkady denounces him as a murderer and kicks him out. Joshua uses information about his father's affair to see his dying mother. After reminiscing about the past, Joshua's mother asks him to go to his grandmother's birthday party, which Joshua agrees to.",8abd865925522f60687bafb127992f8b,What are the first names of the people whose mother is dying?,Joshua,Joshua and Reuben,bert,fa8d25b3d6963d5c0cf9375e48b15676,What are the first names of the people whose mother is dying?,Joshua,"Joshua and Reuben (Roth and Furlong).

"The film is a semi-biographical story based upon the early life and rise to prominence of Native American dog musher George Attla, Jr. (1933–2015).  Attla, known as ""the Huslia Hustler,"" took his nickname from one of his mentors, Jimmy Huntington, who first began winning races during Attla's childhood.  In recent generations, this nickname has become associated with Attla far more than with Huntington.  Attla was a leading star of the 1960s and 1970s in the sport of sprint dog sled racing.  He won the Fur Rendezvous World Championship race, held in Anchorage, Alaska, 10 times between 1958 and 1982.  He also won 8 championships in the Open North American Championship race, held in Fairbanks, Alaska.  In addition, despite his mushing experience being geared more towards sprint than distance racing, Attla competed in the inaugural Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1973, placing fifth.  In a 2011 interview, Attla spoke of the popularity of the Iditarod, and how sprint racing ""is now a second-class sport"" as a result. The general theme of the story centered around Attla's rivalry with the other leading sprint competitors of the day, fellow Alaska Native Gareth Wright (the brother of political gadfly Don Wright and grandfather of modern-day dog musher Ramy Brooks) and Massachusetts musher Roland ""Doc"" Lombard, the preparations for an upcoming big race, and his first major race victory. The movie was shot on location in Fairbanks, Alaska.

"The film opens in 1099 at the end of the First Crusade, depicting Christian Crusaders sacking Jerusalem and slaughtering the local population. A Flemish Christian knight named Charles Le Vaillant becomes demoralized by the horrors of war and decides to create a new religious order. This new order brings together members from the three main religions of the region: Christians, Jews, and Muslims. As a self-declared leader and messiah, Charles writes the sacred texts of the Order. While traveling to Syria his camp is attacked by the Christian knights, who kill Le Vaillant. The last chapter from their religious text, buried by Le Vaillant in a secret place, becomes lost in the desert after the attack. In the modern day, Rudy Cafmeyer, a thief and smuggler of valuable historical artifacts, breaks into a high-security building and steals a precious Fabergé egg. He triggers an alarm in the process and is forced to fight his way out of the building, finding no car to meet him because the getaway driver, Yuri, was forced to leave by police. His problems are compounded when a potential buyer attempts to steal the egg and falls on it, destroying it. It is revealed that Rudy's father is archaeologist and museum curator Oscar ""Ozzie"" Cafmeyer. Ozzie travels to Israel in search of a secret he has discovered and is kidnapped while on the phone with Rudy, who travels to Jerusalem to rescue him. Ozzie's associate, Professor Walt Finley, gives Rudy the key to a safe-deposit box in East Jerusalem before being gunned down by unknown assailants. Rudy opens the safe-deposit box and finds an ancient map showing a series of tunnels and a treasure room beneath Jerusalem.",6c2224308e7bb0c2e66e9de3ba6af313,What is the first name of the person who is forced to fight their way out of a building during a robbery?,Rudy,Charles,bert,26c57c040b17ea9e4cf041d18f304c35,What is the first name of the person who is forced to fight their way out of a building during a robbery?,Rudy,Oscar,bert,70ac5d88195ee4ff7ff54da1e3f5a0a5,What is the first name of the person who is forced to fight their way out of a building during a robbery?,Rudy,"Yuri,",bert,9f217bcb9dff6ae0836b853fa0185b42,What is the first name of the person who triggers an alarm while stealing something?,Rudy,Charles,bert,7688140ec1ab678c90d32ab476703fb6,What is the first name of the person who triggers an alarm while stealing something?,Rudy,Oscar,bert,daae672d31a6c4ce4d280dfc9aeacfd2,What is the first name of the person who triggers an alarm while stealing something?,Rudy,"Oscar ""Ozzie"" Cafmeyer.

"The film opens in 1940, with Lawrence in a screening room watching a documentary film chronicling her life, then flashes back to Clapham in 1915, when she leaves home to join her vaudevillian father in a dilapidated Brixton music hall. Eventually she joins the chorus in André Charlot's West End revue. She reunites with close childhood friend Noël Coward who provides witty commentary on Gertie's actions. Charlot becomes annoyed with Gertie's efforts to stand out, literally, from the chorus. He threatens to fire her, but stage manager Jack Roper intercedes and gets her hired as a general understudy to the leads.  She marries Jack, but it becomes clear she is more inclined to perform onstage than stay home and play wife. While pregnant, she insists on going on for an absent star, and captivates the audience with her own star-making performance of ""Burlington Bertie"". Charlot and Roper witness the audience's warm approval, and both realize, Charlot grudgingly and Roper wistfully, that Gertie belongs on the stage. After their daughter Pamela is born, Gertrude is angered when Roper takes the baby on a pub crawl, and leaves him. A subsequent courtship with Sir Anthony Spencer, an English nobleman, polishes Gertie's rough edges and transforms her into a lady. Caught at a chic supper club when she is supposed to be on a sick day, she is fired from the Charlot Revue. Squired by Spencer, she becomes a 'society darling'.

"The film opens in 1940, with Lawrence in a screening room watching a documentary film chronicling her life, then flashes back to Clapham in 1915, when she leaves home to join her vaudevillian father in a dilapidated Brixton music hall. Eventually she joins the chorus in André Charlot's West End revue. She reunites with close childhood friend Noël Coward who provides witty commentary on Gertie's actions. Charlot becomes annoyed with Gertie's efforts to stand out, literally, from the chorus. He threatens to fire her, but stage manager Jack Roper intercedes and gets her hired as a general understudy to the leads.  She marries Jack, but it becomes clear she is more inclined to perform onstage than stay home and play wife. While pregnant, she insists on going on for an absent star, and captivates the audience with her own star-making performance of ""Burlington Bertie"". Charlot and Roper witness the audience's warm approval, and both realize, Charlot grudgingly and Roper wistfully, that Gertie belongs on the stage. After their daughter Pamela is born, Gertrude is angered when Roper takes the baby on a pub crawl, and leaves him. A subsequent courtship with Sir Anthony Spencer, an English nobleman, polishes Gertie's rough edges and transforms her into a lady. Caught at a chic supper club when she is supposed to be on a sick day, she is fired from the Charlot Revue. Squired by Spencer, she becomes a 'society darling'. Coward then convinces Charlot to feature her in his new production, and she is finally recognized as a star. When the revue opens in New York City, she dallies with an actor and a banker, bringing the number of her suitors to three.",f3634ca2204d37eb68889e9d58cd2306,What's the full name of the person who courts Lawrence?,Sir Anthony Spencer,Noël Coward,bert,2b79b654d291aaf5f574a1b567dbce7b,What's the nickname of the person that the stage manager marries?,Gertie,Charlot,bert,123fe59d51efd053e0f19b91c1530718,What's the nickname of the person that the stage manager marries?,Gertie,Charlot becomes annoyed with Gertie's,bert,97b851a0888b5ac4366642babe5ec198,What's the nickname of the person that the stage manager marries?,Gertie,Gertie's,bert,4ecb18ce90f88ac5ee76112f6f583a40,What's the nickname of the person that the stage manager marries?,Gertie,Gertie's actions.

"The film opens in Edwardian times in Hocombe Woods, where Doris Mann and Albert Potter are courting. When Albert searches the woods for a Peeping Tom, Doris is abducted by a monster named Oddbod, which leaves a finger behind. Albert, finding the finger, rushes to the police station and reports the matter to Detective Constable Slobotham, who in turn tells his superior, the henpecked Detective Sergeant Sidney Bung, who has been investigating similar disappearances in the same woods. After searching the woods for further clues, the group stumble across the eerie Bide-A-Wee Rest Home, and are shown to the sitting-room by the butler, Sockett. Sockett informs the mistress of the house, Valeria, of their presence, and she awakens her electrically-charged brother, Dr. Orlando Watt. Dr Watt speaks to the three men, who are frightened from the house when Dr. Watt vanishes and re-appears when his electrical charge runs down. The next day, Bung, Slobotham and Potter interview Dan Dann, a lavatory man, who once worked at Bide-A-Wee as a gardener but is silenced by Oddbod before he can reveal anything. Meanwhile, the police scientist accidentally creates a second creature—Oddbod Junior (Billy Cornelius)—when subjecting Oddbod's finger to an electrical charge.

The two share a moment together, but it is over after Luce fishes the ring out of the punch bowl and goes on her way. Some time later, Rachel goes to Luce's shop and invites her to dinner with Hector and, unknown to Luce, Cooper, a perennial bachelor and self-professed Lothario. Rachel has planned to set up Luce with Coop, while Luce confides to Heck moments before Coop arrives that she's a lesbian. Heck takes this news in stride and is bemused as Coop is undeterred in his attempts to seduce Luce. During the meal, when Coop starts bragging, Luce espouses she believes in love at first sight, while Rachel says it takes time to find the right person. Later on that night, Rachel and Luce share a moment together on the balcony as it rains.",9bbd6186f9d4713733d9f9fb1ec4ccbb,Who is the perennial bachelor romantically interested in?,Luce,she's a lesbian,bert,b397e314a92fdd5358ec0986ad1da5e7,Who is the second daughter of the wedding planner?,Henrietta,Rachel,bert,f315470cf207b1be21a83088da648106,Who is the second daughter of the wedding planner?,Henrietta,"Rachel and Hector's (Matthew Goode) wedding day in North London, England.

"The film opens with ""The Super Fan"", an avid Chiefs fan, making his 3rd belt. The film depicts the lives of 5 Chiefs players: Mike Bajurny (brother of producer David Bajurny), Brady Austin, Mike Henderson and Cory Holland. With the exception of Henderson, all of these players live in an abandoned storage area on the second story of Colisée de Laval, affectionately known as ""The Rat's Nest"". Several players discuss the living conditions. Some don't mind it, while other say that since the room is near an exit, the apartments will not be used for a fire exit. Henderson mentions that the living situation isn't bad for a young single guy. Henderson discusses his role with the team. He doesn't think he is limited to being a fighter, but considers himself to have an Owen Nolan-type of role with the team, where he could be tough as needed. The Super Fan shows how he prepares for a big game: which involves the shining of one of his championship belts.  A shot of the arena is shown with fans mock-fighting each other with security surrounding the ice. Craig Martin discusses a line brawl and how it originated. At the end of the second, the team was trailing 3-0, but the Chiefs would score 7 goals to come back and win. Families of the players discuss their son's and boyfriend's role with the team.

"The film opens with Sir John Falstaff and Justice Shallow walking through the snow, then to a warm fire inside the Boar's Head Tavern, as the two reminisce. After a main credit sequence, the narrator explains that King Henry IV of England has succeeded Richard II, whom he has killed. Richard II's true heir, Edmund Mortimer, is a prisoner in Wales, and Mortimer's cousins Northumberland, Worcester, and Northumberland's son Hotspur demand that Henry rescue Mortimer. The king refuses, and thus Mortimer's cousins begin to plot Henry's overthrow. To Henry's great dissatisfaction, his son Prince Hal spends most of his time at the Boar's Head Tavern, drinking and carousing with prostitutes, thieves and other criminals under John Falstaff's patriarchal influence. Falstaff insists that he and Hal should think of themselves as gentlemen, but Hal warns Falstaff that he will one day reject both this lifestyle and Falstaff. The next morning Hal, Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Poins disguise themselves in Gadshill to prepare to rob a group of traveling pilgrims. After Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto rob the pilgrims, Hal and Poins jump out in disguises and take the stolen treasure from Falstaff as a joke. Back at the Boar's Head Tavern, Falstaff begins to tell Hal and Poins with increasing exaggeration the story of how the money was stolen from him. Hal and Poins poke holes in Falstaff's tale until they reveal their joke to the entire group. In celebration of the newly recovered stolen treasure, Falstaff and Hal take turns impersonating Henry, with a cooking pot crown and vocal impressions. Falstaff's Henry chastises Hal for spending his time with common criminals, but names Sir John Falstaff as his one virtuous friend. Hal's Henry calls Falstaff a ""misleader of youth"".",bf785af11473fdaa78f86421eedda14c,What is the full name of the person who killed someone?,Henry IV,John Falstaff,bert,981c1b4d78776b9c9820f8ff23d4f50a,What is the full name of the person who killed someone?,Henry IV,King Henry IV,bert,011c12f5f3c6135a989caf5782d4f1f5,What is the full name of the person who killed someone?,Henry IV,King Henry IV of England,bert,b5bf8cc6842109891c7fb5e08ad343f0,What is the full name of the person who killed someone?,Henry IV,"King Henry IV of England has succeeded Richard II,",bert,4edbc91322a4a55b5a6ba731a80244a8,What is the full name of the person who killed someone?,Henry IV,"King Henry IV of England has succeeded Richard II, whom he has killed.

"The film was written by Pulitzer Prize winner Ira Berkow, and narrated by actor Dustin Hoffman.  It was directed by Peter Miller, a documentary filmmaker known for his previous films A Class Apart, Sacco and Vanzetti, and The Internationale.Dustin Hoffman does not normally narrate films, and initially turned down the project.  But when he looked at the script, he changed his mind, saying: ""Oh, this is about bigotry and overcoming anti-Semitism, about discrimination and these issues that I grew up with, that really matters to me"".The film opens with a clip from the 1980 satirical comedy film Airplane!, in which a flight attendant is asked by a passenger if she has anything light to read.  She responds by offering an ultra-thin leaflet, saying:  ""How about this leaflet, Famous Jewish Sports Legends?""The stereotype of Jews as non-athletic, as well as anti-semitism, are two issues that many Jewish baseball players faced and had to overcome.  Noted anti-semite Henry Ford wrote on May 22, 1920:  ""If fans wish to know the trouble with American baseball they have it in three words—too much Jew.""  A number of early Jewish ballplayers changed their names, so that it would not be apparent that they were Jewish.The movie discusses the key Jewish ballplayers in each decade since baseball started in the 1860s, and how that helped Jews assimilate and counteract the stereotype of Jews as cerebral but non-athletic.  The film is in part about Jewish immigration and assimilation into American society, bigotry against Jews, the passing on of Jewish traditions even during assimilation, heroism, and the breaking of Jewish stereotypes.Director Miller said:  At its heart, this is a film about overcoming stereotypes.

"The frame story is narrated by a white father, who has recently returned from India, to his son. He explains that man's closest relative in nature is the orangutan, which translates literally as ""man of the forest."" He then tells the story of Ali and his son Bin, natives of Sumatra, who hunt in a jungle village. Ali wants to shoot a marauding tiger, but the orangutans Tua and his baby Rango get in the way, and Rango is almost grabbed by the tiger. While Ali prepares a tiger trap, the orangutans enter Ali's hut and feast on the stored goods. Dozens of orangutans join them, ransacking the hut. When Ali and Bin return to discover the havoc, Ali captures Rango and puts him on a chain. Later, Ali saves Tua from a black panther.  In the night, a tiger enters the camp, and Rango warns Bin in time for him to shoot and scare the tiger away. At dawn, Tua comes for Rango and eats in the hut, while Bin tends the water buffaloes. After the tiger kills a deer, the orangutans scream warnings to each other and flee. Two male tigers approach and chase Bin, Rango and Tua. When Bin is cornered by a tiger, Rango comes to the rescue. The tiger kills Rango, who thus sacrifices his own life for the sake of his human friend, but the water buffalo fights the tiger and kills him. Ali and Bin embrace as Tua waits for Rango, unaware he will never return.",3eb2ca2f204e1cc2db33d1613a7bd1a2,What animal warns Bin about the tiger?,orangutan,a black panther,bert,77156909d22d945a76f865fc04b8cbb0,What animal warns Bin about the tiger?,orangutan,"a black panther.

"The governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper, has to pick a replacement for recently deceased U.S. Senator Sam Foley. His corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor, pressures Hopper to choose his handpicked stooge, while popular committees want a reformer, Henry Hill. The governor's children want him to select Jefferson Smith, the head of the Boy Rangers. Unable to make up his mind between Taylor's stooge and the reformer, Hopper decides to flip a coin. When it lands on edge – and next to a newspaper story on one of Smith's accomplishments – he chooses Smith, calculating that his wholesome image will please the people while his naïveté will make him easy to manipulate. Junior Senator Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine, who was Smith's late father's friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator's daughter, Susan. At Senator Paine's home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith's naïve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith's reputation with ridiculous front page pictures and headlines branding him a bumpkin. To keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who was the aide to Smith's predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America.

"The illegal immigrant population of the United States is estimated to be between 11 and 12 million. The population of unauthorized immigrants peaked in 2007 and has declined since that time. The majority of the U.S. unauthorized immigrants are from Mexico, but ""their numbers (and share of the total) have been declining"" and as of 2016 Mexicans no longer make up a clear majority of unauthorized immigrants, as they did in the past. Unauthorized immigrants made up about 5% of the total U.S. civilian labor force in 2014. By the 2010s, an increasing share of U.S. unauthorized immigrants were long-term residents; in 2015, 66% of adult unauthorized residents had lived in the country for at least ten years, while only 14% had lived in the U.S. for less than five years.In June 2012, President Obama issued a memorandum instructing officers of the federal government to defer deporting young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children as part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Under the program, eligible recipients who applied and were granted DACA status were granted a two-year deferral from deportation and temporary eligibility to work legally in the country. Among other criteria, in order to be eligible a youth applicant must (1) be between age 15 and 31; (2) have come to the United States before the age of 16; (3) have lived in the U.S. continuously for at least five years; (4) be a current student, or have earned a high school diploma or equivalent, or have received an honorable discharge from the U.S. armed services; and (5) must not ""have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to public safety or national security."" The Migration Policy Institution estimated that as of 2016, about 1.3 million unauthorized young adults ages 15 and older were ""immediately eligible for DACA""; of this eligible population, 63% had applied as of March 2016.Children of legal migrants won't qualify as Dreamers under DACA protection because they entered the country legally. This is highlighted as the biggest contradiction in US immigration policy by many advocates of legal immigrants.",4d2b9c7289fb58182bc98621e2e57e11,What ages does an immigrant need to be between to be able to apply for DACA status in the country where unauthorized workers make up 5% of the labor force?,15,31,bert,a6fada6091a502f9b377b75c7df48870,What percentage of the DACA eligible population applied for it as of March 2016 in the country where population of unauthorized immigrants peaked in 2007?,63%,%,bert,4ae037b15fd3488087bf101cb0c28443,What percentage of the DACA eligible population applied for it as of March 2016 in the country where population of unauthorized immigrants peaked in 2007?,63%,1.3 million,bert,5c55ec1c8dd90dc29890ebe574ca4224,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The inner German border was never entirely sealed in the fashion of the border between the two Koreas and could be crossed in either direction throughout the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air – the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin. The border could be crossed legally only through a limited number of air, road, rail and river routes. Foreigners were able to cross East German territory to or from West Berlin, Denmark, Sweden, Poland and Czechoslovakia. However, they had only limited and very tightly controlled access to the rest of East Germany and faced numerous restrictions on travel, accommodation and expenditure. Lengthy inspections caused long delays to traffic at the crossing points. Westerners found crossing the inner German border to be a somewhat disturbing experience; Jan Morris wrote: Travelling from west to east through [the inner German border] was like entering a drab and disturbing dream, peopled by all the ogres of totalitarianism, a half-lit world of shabby resentments, where anything could be done to you, I used to feel, without anybody ever hearing of it, and your every step was dogged by watchful eyes and mechanisms.",7e4cb2ce4d710ba25d27ba03f6cdccf6,What is the last name of the person who reportedly used to feel that your every step was dogged by watchful eyes and mechanisms?,Morris,Jan,bert,86a2ed3b1a64563b9e36dd65f83c6b5d,What is the last name of the person who reportedly used to feel that your every step was dogged by watchful eyes and mechanisms?,Morris,Jan Morris,bert,ace34738152205397ba835fd278b6d35,What is the last name of the person who reportedly used to feel that your every step was dogged by watchful eyes and mechanisms?,Morris,Morris wrote:,bert,06640a1c223dd5ea2dfe79ec22b517b7,What is the last name of the person who reportedly used to feel that your every step was dogged by watchful eyes and mechanisms?,Morris,Westerners,bert,eba594f2a9fd5ba737cd88a7ed6f4be3,What is the last name of the person who reportedly used to feel that your every step was dogged by watchful eyes and mechanisms?,Morris,Westerners found crossing the inner German border to be a somewhat disturbing experience; Jan Morris,bert,b05d16affd04c016097b35b4654f37f7,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The local people have traditionally utilized material from the forest, whether for use in their architecture, to make pirogues (dugout canoes), to provide fiber for weaving, to provide firewood, to gather leaves for traditional medicine, or to flavor their drinks.  Most of the residents are subsistence rice farmers who cultivate irrigated paddies in valleys or who plant on hillsides that have been cleared and burned (slash and burn agriculture, known locally as tavy).  The swamps which formerly covered vast areas of Andapa Basin have been converted to rice paddies which are intensively cultivated; however the Tsimihety traditionally practice slash and burn techniques on the hillsides in preference to irrigated rice fields.  Coffee was an important cash crop before market prices fell in the 1970s, but vanilla remains an important crop for the area.  Until the mid-2000s, vanilla prices were high, but they have since fallen off significantly.  The crash of vanilla prices, along with a rapidly growing population and steady decrease in cultivatable land, has resulted in widespread and extreme poverty.  Between January and April, before the main rice harvest, many people in the region do not receive enough food to eat.  The Sava Region, which includes Marojejy, is the poorest region in Madagascar, and in 2011, continued rises in global food prices—particularly that of imported rice—has made obtaining food more difficult for rural families.Not only have international environmental organizations (such as Conservation International, Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wide Fund for Nature, and Care International) established programs to help local residents, many local people work to improve their situation through environmental and health education programs.  An increase in sustainable agriculture, silviculture, conservation awareness, and improved education and health care have also furthered the goal of protecting the environment and promoting livelihoods centered on the remaining forest.  Limited and responsible ecotourism is also seen as a long-term alternative to continued deforestation.",350676748a597e10a1a0e4522702f06e,What crop is no longer as important to the area after prices fell?,Coffee,"Coffee was an important cash crop before market prices fell in the 1970s, but vanilla",bert,1fc16e2977b4aae84df3cc6c727c71f0,What crop is no longer as important to the area after prices fell?,Coffee,rice,bert,0f6a7b85e407f7a2e1a66a39d8175f7f,What crop is no longer as important to the area after prices fell?,Coffee,rice farmers who cultivate irrigated paddies in valleys or who plant on hillsides that have been cleared and burned (slash and burn agriculture,bert,10ce36a02f544c0559e2978fe51cdd30,What crop is no longer as important to the area after prices fell?,Coffee,vanilla,bert,349acca53f2a5932db5ab25cc1435ae0,What crop is no longer as important to the area after prices fell?,Coffee,"vanilla remains an important crop for the area.

"The night before Memorial Day, Tyra and Trevor are stabbed to death in their apartment by a cloaked figure in a black and white papier-mâché mask. The next day, Rachel, her cousin Leo, and their five friends (Mickey, Cindy, Seth, Reagan and Jeremy) head to Memorial Lake Campground for the first time since Rachel's adopted brother Danny accidentally drowned there three years ago. After reaching the camp and setting up, the group drink around a campfire and tell ghost stories, though Seth goes back to the cabins to watch television, and catches a news broadcast mentioning the murders of Tyra and Trevor, who were supposed to come along on the trip. Seth rushes back to the others and tells them about what happened to Trevor and Tyra, just as a booby trap launches a spear into Jeremy, killing him, and scattering the group. Seth tries to drive to safety, but runs out of gas, and is confronted by the killer, who sends a man he had earlier captured out to tell Seth to get out of his car. Seth refuses to get out, so the killer persuades him by shooting the hostage. Back at the camp, Mickey bludgeons a masked man with a baseball bat, unmasking him afterward to discover it was Seth, who was gagged and had his hands tied together. The killer then attacks Reagan, killing her by forcing her to crawl across razor blades while he beats her with a hot piece of rebar. Next, Cindy is shot, and Mickey is tortured to death with fish hooks, nails, and a knife. Rachel and Leo regroup, and a hysterical Rachel blames herself for everything that has happened, confessing that she was the one who brought Danny out on the boat the night he drowned. This causes Leo to reveal that he is the killer, and that Danny (who was his biological brother) has been ""speaking"" to him, ordering him to avenge his death by murdering everyone involved in it. Leo tries to kill Rachel, but she shoots him with his own gun, revealing before she does so that she purposely drowned Danny, who she hated.",aa1faf52a097f543c0d21dbe6faa28c3,What are the names of the persons that Seth tells about what happened to Trevor and Tyra?,Rachel,"(Mickey,",bert,7dca2dd251912f923b4da946697aaf1a,What are the names of the persons that Seth tells about what happened to Trevor and Tyra?,Rachel,"(Mickey, Cindy,",bert,ee399dd30cf1afdc25581199293e3a6d,What are the names of the persons that Seth tells about what happened to Trevor and Tyra?,Rachel,"Rachel, her cousin Leo,",bert,a21c8c493168d4a46855dc5de770d274,What are the names of the persons that Seth tells about what happened to Trevor and Tyra?,Rachel,"Rachel, her cousin Leo, and their five friends (Mickey,",bert,87664ae28f99f7a607a099aabca915cf,What are the names of the persons that Seth tells about what happened to Trevor and Tyra?,Rachel,"Rachel, her cousin Leo, and their five friends (Mickey, Cindy,",bert,8d9b5da339312dff37777c5a1274ea77,What is the name of the person who killed Reagan?,Leo,Danny,bert,8f70cb800845fd73ee6676d49aa7f0c5,What is the name of the person who killed Reagan?,Leo,"Danny (who was his biological brother) has been ""speaking"" to him, ordering him to avenge his death by murdering everyone involved in it.

"The painting was included in Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition at The Leo Castelli Gallery, a show in which all the works had pre-sold before its opening in February 1962. The exhibition, which ran from February 10 through March 3, 1962, included Engagement Ring, Blam and The Refrigerator. He included the painting in his Artist's Studio—Look Mickey (1973), showing it hanging prominently on the wall of the pictorial space intended to depict his studio as the ideal studio, and implying that his popularity with critic and public ratifies his choice of popular culture subject matter. Reflecting on Look Mickey many years later, he said: The idea of doing [a cartoon painting] without apparent alteration just occurred to me ... and I did one really almost half seriously to get an idea of what it might look like. And as I was painting this painting I kind of got interested in organizing it as a painting and brought it to some kind of conclusion as an aesthetic statement, which I hadn't really intended to do to begin with. And then I really went back to my other kind of painting, which was pretty abstract. Or tried to. But I had this cartoon painting in my studio, and it was a little too formidable. I couldn't keep my eyes off it, and it sort of prevented me from painting in any other way, and then I decided this stuff was really serious ... I would say I had it on my easel for a week. I would just want to see what it looked like. I tried to make it a work of art. I wasn't trying just to copy. I realized that this was just so much more compelling. The painting was bequeathed to the Washington National Gallery of Art after Lichtenstein's death in 1997, following a 1990 pledge in honor of the institution's 50th Anniversary. It remains in the gallery's collection, where, as of November 2012, it is on permanent view.Harold Rosenberg once described Lichtensteins reworking of the comics source as follows: ""...the difference between a comic strip of Mickey Mouse and a Lichtenstein painting of the same was art history, or the fact that Lichtenstein paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""",62f6b77d511efd38c212c6b744cefa7e,"What is the last name of the person that said that the man who painted Look Mickey as someone who ""...paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""?",Rosenberg,Castelli,bert,fb8798bdb72aa7c1102bfdb4acf88764,"What is the last name of the person that said that the man who painted Look Mickey as someone who ""...paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""?",Rosenberg,Leo Castelli,bert,4a8fc631b540a4718c7bf2d504b0504f,"What is the last name of the person that said that the man who painted Look Mickey as someone who ""...paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""?",Rosenberg,Rosenberg once described Lichtensteins,bert,82dae9fd884603e8c5a6a1399ff5148a,"What is the last name of the person that said that the man who painted Look Mickey as someone who ""...paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""?",Rosenberg,view.Harold Rosenberg,bert,31b839224db006b3689e03a6254e0106,Where is the cartoon painting on permanent display today?,Washington National Gallery of Art,National Gallery of Art,bert,5244f825d39810ea3d79343de69351e2,Where is the cartoon painting on permanent display today?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington,bert,6787d2cfc2bb37a50f3d8a04942b073e,Where is the cartoon painting on permanent display today?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington National,bert,e8f7ef0dc49cc4fb89aff8c30e7425b9,Where is the cartoon painting on permanent display today?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington National Gallery,bert,e646f2f6f9feb0f51e7362a1e092091d,Where was the painting that was hanging prominently during Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition bequeathed after his death?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington,bert,6cde88a114196a31fc964304de369f66,Where was the painting that was hanging prominently during Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition bequeathed after his death?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington National,bert,14ee90c96f1b2d3b072e532f3737fd64,Where was the painting that was hanging prominently during Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition bequeathed after his death?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington National Gallery,bert,e842ab1cc507362b9e28ff182e1aca81,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The pavilions are named for Exelon, a Chicago-based company that generates the electricity transmitted by its subsidiary Commonwealth Edison (ComEd). The city of Chicago has collaborated with Exelon and ComEd on a variety of environmental projects, including the installation of solar power in buildings, support for sustainable design and renewable energy, and furthering educational and social awareness of green architecture in the city. The pavilions cost $7 million, $5.5 million of which was donated by Exelon and ComEd.The lead designer for the North Pavilions was Thomas H. Beeby of Hammond Beeby Rupert Ainge Architects. Beeby's designs for the North Pavilions are ""in harmony with the Harris Theater"", for which he was the architect as well. The North Pavilions are along Randolph Street on either side of the theater, which is Millennium Park's indoor performing-arts venue.The South Pavilions were designed by architect Renzo Piano of Renzo Piano Building Workshop. Piano designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing, which is across Monroe Street from the South Pavilions and opened in 2009. The facades of the South Pavilions are limestone and glass in order to complement the Modern Wing, even though it was not completed until several years after the pavilions were finished. Piano also designed the Nichols Bridgeway, which connects Millennium Park and the Art Institute, and is next to the Southwest Pavilion.The design process for the Exelon Pavilions began in September 2001, with construction starting in January 2004. The general contractor for all four pavilions was Walsh Construction. The South Pavilions were completed in July 2004 and opened when Millennium Park celebrated its grand opening on July 16, 2004. The North Pavilions were not finished in July 2004, but were completed in November of that year. All four Exelon Pavilions were officially opened to the public on April 30, 2005.",8f99366d5ef240832b358790c3d0f514,What company does the man that designed the South Pavilions work for?,Renzo Piano Building Workshop,Beeby Rupert Ainge Architects.,bert,a421eff7f4d3c3872d6592a4f51fe973,What company does the man that designed the South Pavilions work for?,Renzo Piano Building Workshop,Commonwealth Edison,bert,3dde7ff76ad8ba12e01fa9f3ac0b0769,What company does the man that designed the South Pavilions work for?,Renzo Piano Building Workshop,"Exelon,",bert,b78485b0ed8b5a8f122bc73b53cb2cfb,What company does the man that designed the South Pavilions work for?,Renzo Piano Building Workshop,"Exelon, a Chicago-based company that generates the electricity transmitted by its subsidiary Commonwealth Edison",bert,2511bb43b0f6d34d5445f84293a7fe7e,What company does the man that designed the South Pavilions work for?,Renzo Piano Building Workshop,Hammond Beeby Rupert Ainge Architects.,bert,761249ff82e5cd3b0395ac97ee56eae6,What company does the man that designed the South Pavilions work for?,Renzo Piano Building Workshop,Walsh Construction.,bert,c419dd480c72ebcc299520aa9f028606,What is the first name of the person who designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing?,Renzo,Renzo Piano of Renzo,bert,81544c53edb5eac6373bdc39e2e3d173,What is the first name of the person who designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing?,Renzo,Thomas,bert,57966bb549c317e203bf27911a689609,What is the first name of the person who designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing?,Renzo,Thomas H.,bert,b6cde1bb93a14c83e9027269eaae9e6d,What is the first name of the person who designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing?,Renzo,architect Renzo,bert,0f3373b62c92addfad152147a7524883,What is the first name of the person who designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing?,Renzo,zo,bert,54fd150f328a4bfa37989d9651b297b9,What is the name of the pavilions that were finished first?,The South Pavilions,Exelon,bert,a34adf15e2755b3d7a8c9ad2f0e9e14b,What is the name of the pavilions that were finished first?,The South Pavilions,Exelon Pavilions,bert,7971e701ab3f6b9d0822526cc462f563,Which pavilions was the man that designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing not responsible for?,North Pavilions,"North Pavilions are along Randolph Street on either side of the theater, which is Millennium Park's indoor performing-arts venue.The South",bert,f1c924c636a06cf8fe9ee51a589ff664,Which pavilions was the man that designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing not responsible for?,North Pavilions,"North Pavilions are along Randolph Street on either side of the theater, which is Millennium Park's indoor performing-arts venue.The South Pavilions",bert,0eb8d5c008f2d7de603a323eab6fb4fc,Which pavilions was the man that designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing not responsible for?,North Pavilions,South,bert,b93df8f13d6293e05590108e3e5b2381,Which pavilions was the man that designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing not responsible for?,North Pavilions,South Pavilions,bert,cdd1ff533f9703f520c28faaa6e3856c,Which pavilions was the man that designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing not responsible for?,North Pavilions,venue.The South,bert,d2597e8835f80310df2a9b62d7b76ea4,Which pavilions was the man that designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing not responsible for?,North Pavilions,venue.The South Pavilions,bert,9da8f1077c5b88866b7b81950c1d7ab9,none,none,none,none,none

"The plot of Darfur revolves around six Western journalists who visit a small village in Darfur in western Sudan under the escort of a squad of troops of the African Union peacekeeping mission. When they learn the brutal state sponsored militia called the Janjaweed are heading towards the village, they are faced with an impossible decision: leave Sudan and report the atrocities to the world, or risk their own lives and stay in the hopes of averting a certain slaughter. While most of them flee back to their base, two of the journalists, Freddie Smith, and Theo Schwartz, decide to stay behind along with the Nigerian commander of the AU unit, Captain Jack Tobamke, to try to save the villagers when the Arab Janjaweed enter the village and begin to indiscriminately kill all the Black African men, women, and children. Despite their efforts to save some villagers, Captain Tobamke, Theo, and Freddie are all killed one by one in the subsequent shootout with the Janjaweed, but not before killing or wounding a few dozen of the savage militia. The surviving Janjaweed then burn the village to the ground and move on, presumably to continue their genocide rampage across the Darfur landscape. The final scene shows the female member of the journalist team, Malin Lausberg, who had fled with most of the other reporters and AU soldiers during the Janjaweed attack, now return to the destroyed village the next day with a group of AU soldiers only to find everyone dead, including two of her colleagues. But she finds an infant that Freddie protected by hiding under Theo's dead body as the sole survivor of the massacre.

"The previous convention's lack of Tejano representation fostered a perception that only newcomers to Texas were dissatisfied. The president of the Convention of 1832, Stephen F. Austin, traveled to San Antonio de Béxar to garner support for the changes the convention had requested. Austin found that the Tejano leaders largely agreed with the result of the convention but opposed the methods by which the resolutions had been proposed.  They urged patience; Bustamante was still president and would not look favorably on a petition from settlers who had recently sided with his rival, Santa Anna.As a compromise, the ayuntamiento of San Antonio de Béxar drafted a petition containing similar language to the convention's resolutions.  Following legal norms, they submitted this to Músquiz, who forwarded it to the Mexican Congress in early 1833.  At this time, the federal and state governments were in flux.  Bustamante had resigned the presidency in late December 1832 as part of a treaty to end the civil war.  There was no effective state government.  The governor of Coahuila y Tejas had died in September 1832, and his replacement, federalist Juan Martín de Veramendi, immediately dissolved the state legislature, which had centralist leanings.  Veramendi called elections to seat a new government in early 1833.  Due to the political uncertainty, Austin urged that the federal government be given several months to address the petition.  If no action was eventually taken, he advised that Texas residents would form their own state government, essentially declaring independence from Coahuila, if not from Mexico.Austin's timeframe was endorsed by Tejano leaders, but it did not pacify the Texian settlers.  Towards the end of December, the central committee called for a new convention to meet in San Felipe de Austin in April 1833.  Elections were scheduled for March.  This action disturbed the Tejano leaders, who saw it as a violation of their agreement with Austin.Communities in Texas elected 56 delegates for the new convention.  In a departure from the previous election, San Antonio de Béxar also sent delegates, including James Bowie, the son-in-law of Governor Veramendi.  Bowie, like many of his fellow delegates, was known as an agitator who wanted immediate change.

"The promotional clip for ""Something"" was shot in late October 1969, not long after Lennon had privately announced that he was leaving the band. By this time, the individual Beatles had drawn apart and so the film consisted of separate clips of each Beatle walking around his home, accompanied by his wife, edited together. Harrison's segment shows him and Boyd together in the garden at Kinfauns; in author John Winn's description, Harrison appears ""solemn"" while Boyd is seen ""smiling sweetly"" and ""sporting leather and fur coats"". Winn also comments on the attractiveness of all the wives in contrast to the unkempt appearance of McCartney, especially, who had sunk into depression at the realisation that the Beatles were over. The four segments were edited and compiled into a single film clip by Neil Aspinall. Writing in The New York Times following Aspinall's death in 2008, Allan Kozinn said: ""What Mr. Aspinall's idyllic film avoided showing was that the Beatles were at that point barely on speaking terms. In the film, no two Beatles are seen together.""In 2015, following restoration overseen by Apple's Jonathan Clyde, the ""Something"" promo film was included in the Beatles' video compilation 1 and its expanded edition, 1+. Rolling Stone journalist Rob Sheffield comments on the significance of the clip, with regard to the band's history: [E]ach couple projects a totally different vibe – George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha the sheepdog, Ringo and Maureen goofing around on motorbikes, John and Yoko serene in their matching black robes. Each Beatle looks like he's found what he was looking for – but they're heading for four separate futures. In her review of 1+, for Paste, Gillian Gaar says that with the Beatles' promotional films of their singles, from ""Love Me Do"" to ""Something"" (the last one they made during their career), ""you can see the development of the promo clip, progressing from a short film that simply served up a straight performance to a piece of work that was striving to be something more artistic.""",fc18f717c757bad17d5e9e72f0374697,What are the first names of the couple in matching robes?,John,George,bert,e52ba52f72590118f4c97ad6eed2ace4,What are the first names of the couple in matching robes?,John,"George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul",bert,1b4c32be18c229f25b214a3143a34331,What are the first names of the couple in matching robes?,John,Paul,bert,dec5fc38996697b2a1aa8c6da03e53f4,What are the first names of the couple in matching robes?,John,"Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha the sheepdog, Ringo and Maureen goofing around on motorbikes, John",bert,e09f6ad75aa937cbd4ccbba2080e22a9,What are the first names of the couple in matching robes?,John,"Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha the sheepdog, Ringo and Maureen goofing around on motorbikes, John and Yoko",bert,e77c8ca0709b093ee4397d11272bb498,What are the first names of the couple on motor bikes?,Ringo,George,bert,bb2b0a3511f1f216b5016c9d51c2bd15,What are the first names of the couple on motor bikes?,Ringo,"George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul",bert,1b33f33072068d21e543bcf6f3f01cf3,What are the first names of the couple on motor bikes?,Ringo,"George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha",bert,bfd5978320ec4398abb314ca24fd1d63,What are the first names of the couple on motor bikes?,Ringo,Paul,bert,7e5634729bb5b8b785f8c57a8c215557,What are the first names of the couple on motor bikes?,Ringo,Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha,bert,75cd5f6f2dc26bba8fe773c693bb1b8d,What are the first names of the couple on motor bikes?,Ringo,"Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha the sheepdog, Ringo and Maureen goofing around on motorbikes, John",bert,879a69e9492bcf788d7d8ac832c761d9,What are the first names of the couple that was in the video in their finery?,George,George and Patti,bert,1c119ed08b5d6ad2fb0a8260626596a6,What are the first names of the couple that was in the video in their finery?,George,"George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul",bert,3cc18048ca1be5f2930588d4b4b7ad55,What are the first names of the couple that was in the video in their finery?,George,"George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda",bert,bb5a86768caa2731f9f3a62f8cdc3720,What are the first names of the couple that was in the video in their finery?,George,Paul,bert,1da7177c31799fa59341512c79113fd2,What are the first names of the couple that was in the video in their finery?,George,Paul and Linda,bert,a133cd91c4555e5e6181665418de0329,What are the first names of the who were shown at a farm in Scotland?,Paul,George,bert,925862f259a151f981ff8daf48b65da9,What are the first names of the who were shown at a farm in Scotland?,Paul,"George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul",bert,814314a86ed00b17107a056cea514d4e,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

In her review of 1+, for Paste, Gillian Gaar says that with the Beatles' promotional films of their singles, from ""Love Me Do"" to ""Something"" (the last one they made during their career), ""you can see the development of the promo clip, progressing from a short film that simply served up a straight performance to a piece of work that was striving to be something more artistic.""",e74bca633dbff64b2b876841764382de,What are the first names of the who were shown at a farm in Scotland?,Paul,"George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha",bert,21c5e74954d4eea0ae9d0accafe119a3,What are the first names of the who were shown at a farm in Scotland?,Paul,Paul and Linda,bert,51fbedee39ae4f3c231b1382b36605c7,What are the first names of the who were shown at a farm in Scotland?,Paul,Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha,bert,22c2826c39e0115fd15bdeae2e953775,"What did John and his wife wear in ""Something""?",matching black robes,black,bert,e10893948cb9ee4e67b8b413dee347f3,"What did John and his wife wear in ""Something""?",matching black robes,black robes,bert,5bad3c9d871f180107352e8522381ba9,"What did John and his wife wear in ""Something""?",matching black robes,robes,bert,26cf484ac6ac141e0f50bf057aab3cb9,"What did John and his wife wear in ""Something""?",matching black robes,serene in their matching black,bert,d306f5d29440c880f973c3e57aa0045c,"What did John and his wife wear in ""Something""?",matching black robes,serene in their matching black robes,bert,bfd707b441c361c92ca3c3cd3a8f17e8,What is the first name of the wife of the man who privately announced he was leaving the band?,Yoko,"George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha",bert,3f9a43fc96001520811660963741bb71,What is the first name of the wife of the man who privately announced he was leaving the band?,Yoko,Linda,bert,2d19423cc465c71435494eaed7dde007,What is the first name of the wife of the man who privately announced he was leaving the band?,Yoko,Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha,bert,2b62f22db135f8460725051566cac97a,What is the first name of the wife of the man who privately announced he was leaving the band?,Yoko,Martha,bert,24939683d21761bbc92e0b2b4918dd07,What is the first name of the wife of the man who privately announced he was leaving the band?,Yoko,"Martha the sheepdog, Ringo and Maureen goofing around on motorbikes, John and Yoko",bert,9b2bca260445c24ade2be9745878c4c9,What is the first name of the wife of the man who privately announced he was leaving the band?,Yoko,"Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha",bert,3f3521b0156d321765be8100213a068e,What is the first name of the wife of the man who was shown at the garden at Kinfauns?,Patti,"George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda",bert,e7be3ab6e27c0d8216f8392f4e6d493d,What is the first name of the wife of the man who was shown at the garden at Kinfauns?,Patti,Linda,bert,beb1528ef49f5e8be3d1669a3cfe1e05,What is the first name of the wife of the man who was shown at the garden at Kinfauns?,Patti,Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha,bert,3139aec4ea5c088518ae2c1ed5ba48bd,What is the first name of the wife of the man who was shown at the garden at Kinfauns?,Patti,Martha,bert,24047d5e9ba65b3a09392b70925de703,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The promotional clip for ""Something"" was shot in late October 1969, not long after Lennon had privately announced that he was leaving the band. By this time, the individual Beatles had drawn apart and so the film consisted of separate clips of each Beatle walking around his home, accompanied by his wife, edited together. Harrison's segment shows him and Boyd together in the garden at Kinfauns; in author John Winn's description, Harrison appears ""solemn"" while Boyd is seen ""smiling sweetly"" and ""sporting leather and fur coats"". Winn also comments on the attractiveness of all the wives in contrast to the unkempt appearance of McCartney, especially, who had sunk into depression at the realisation that the Beatles were over. The four segments were edited and compiled into a single film clip by Neil Aspinall. Writing in The New York Times following Aspinall's death in 2008, Allan Kozinn said: ""What Mr. Aspinall's idyllic film avoided showing was that the Beatles were at that point barely on speaking terms. In the film, no two Beatles are seen together.""In 2015, following restoration overseen by Apple's Jonathan Clyde, the ""Something"" promo film was included in the Beatles' video compilation 1 and its expanded edition, 1+.

"The reliability of the results can be improved by lengthening the testing time. For example, if counting beta decays for 250 minutes is enough to give an error of ± 80 years, with 68% confidence, then doubling the counting time to 500 minutes will allow a sample with only half as much 14C to be measured with the same error term of 80 years.Radiocarbon dating is generally limited to dating samples no more than 50,000 years old, as samples older than that have insufficient 14C to be measurable.  Older dates have been obtained by using special sample preparation techniques, large samples, and very long measurement times.  These techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present.Radiocarbon dates are generally presented with a range of one standard deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) on either side of the mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.Errors in procedure can also lead to errors in the results. If 1% of the benzene in a modern reference sample accidentally evaporates, scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years.",12b38cdb3ce36826242adcffb7177bb4,"What type of techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present?",special sample preparation techniques,special,bert,4287e8e37485c5fcf8cff737d24fee0b,"What type of techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present?",special sample preparation techniques,special sample preparation,bert,4b4a9355fc1187645ad6619058f6a1c4,"What type of techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present?",special sample preparation techniques,"special sample preparation techniques, large samples",bert,04bb773403e74e2f232b3f4cc52c73d0,"What type of techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present?",special sample preparation techniques,"special sample preparation techniques, large samples, and very long measurement times",bert,983cdf23a61e64edc67fb6bb6386faea,"What type of techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present?",special sample preparation techniques,using special sample preparation techniques,bert,695c7da9237b4bc70c10662bd10dfc65,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The second floor, in addition to housing the gubernatorial offices, features the Gallery of Governors with portraits of former Michigan Governors on the walls of the rotunda; the gallery extends up to the third floor. The governor's offices were among the most extensively restored during the 1989–1992 restoration. The office features a suite of original furnishings manufactured in 1876 by the Feige Brothers Company of Saginaw. The former chambers of the Michigan Supreme Court are in the south wing of the building. The court vacated its chambers in 1970 for larger quarters, eventually moving to its current location in the Michigan Hall of Justice. The room is now used by the Senate Appropriations Committee and named for longtime chairman Harry Gast.Public access to Michigan's legislative bodies is through the third floor. The capitol building holds the chambers and offices of the bicameral state legislature, which is composed of the Michigan House of Representatives and Michigan Senate. Public galleries are at both ends of the third floor. The Senate, with 38 members, has its chambers on the south side of the building, while the House of Representatives, with 110 members, has its chambers in the north wing. House sessions are normally held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 1:00 PM and Thursdays at 10:30 AM, while Senate sessions begin at 10:00 AM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Both houses occasionally convene on Mondays and Fridays. Senate and House sessions are taped by Michigan Government Television, a public service body transmitted to local cable television systems' government-access television channels. Similar to C-SPAN, MGTV has made live coverage of the legislative proceedings available since July 15, 1996.",aa8f7d26503c9b6948b8dee0973e717c,What group moved to the Michigan Hall of Justice??,Michigan Supreme Court,Michigan Supreme Court are in the south wing of the building.

"The second of James Cook's historic voyages, 1772–1775, was primarily a search for the elusive Terra Australis Incognita that was still believed to lie somewhere in the unexplored latitudes below 40°S. Cook left England in September 1772 with two ships, HMS Resolution and HMS Adventure. After pausing at Cape Town, on 22 November the two ships sailed due south, but were driven to the east by heavy gales. They managed to edge further south, encountering their first pack ice on 10 December. This soon became a solid barrier, which tested Cook's seamanship as he manoeuvered for a passage through. Eventually, he found open water, and was able to continue south; on 17 January 1773, the expedition reached the Antarctic Circle at 66°20'S, the first ships to do so. Further progress was barred by ice, and the ships turned north-eastwards and headed for New Zealand, which they reached on 26 March.During the ensuing months, the expedition explored the southern Pacific Ocean before Cook took Resolution south again—Adventure had retired back to South Africa after a fracas with the New Zealand native population. This time Cook was able to penetrate deep beyond the Antarctic Circle, and on 30 January 1774 reached 71°10'S, his Farthest South, but the state of the ice made further southward travel impossible. This southern record would hold for 49 years.In the course of his voyages in Antarctic waters, Cook had encircled the world at latitudes generally above 60°S, and saw nothing but bleak inhospitable islands, without a hint of the fertile continent which some still hoped lay in the south. Cook wrote that if any such continent existed it would be ""a country doomed by nature"", and that ""no man will venture further than I have done, and the land to the South will never be explored"". He concluded: ""Should the impossible be achieved and the land attained, it would be wholly useless and of no benefit to the discoverer or his nation"".",f388ffb876f45271e55686241738709d,What was Cook looking for when he left England in September 1772 with two ships?,Terra Australis Incognita,Terra,bert,73bf3ffdad0c726b097f64efbd35c15c,What was Cook looking for when he left England in September 1772 with two ships?,Terra Australis Incognita,Terra Australis,bert,6cfe9ca2f55ba3ca2d6a33ca46c93e8c,What was Cook looking for when he left England in September 1772 with two ships?,Terra Australis Incognita,search for the elusive Terra Australis Incognita,bert,2dce474d146471b421f54fec0e8c7665,What was Cook looking for when he left England in September 1772 with two ships?,Terra Australis Incognita,the elusive Terra Australis,bert,424746d761845d6122cb6f20f29b7878,What was Cook looking for when he left England in September 1772 with two ships?,Terra Australis Incognita,the elusive Terra Australis Incognita,bert,a378f422826243a3f1c4f69a51652cbd,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"The story encompasses around nine characters portraying nine variants of emotion and an outdated dam.The story starts with Vinay, who is a mariner and works in ships. One day he visits his native place, somewhere in Kerala, with his son Sam to meet his father Shankaran. Shankaran is a village doctor or 'Vaidyan' and is also a master in astrology and the ancient sciences. Sam is a Diabetic and Vinay wanted to have him treated by his grandfather. Another story line is that of the orphan Meera, who has been staying with Shankaran since her childhood, treated as his own daughter and who helps him treat various patients. Vinay and Meera share a special bond and love each other. But when Shankaran studied their horoscopes, he learned that whenever they express their love towards each other, something terrible would happen. Learning this Meera sacrificed her love, and thus Vinay married Sandra who is a TV journalist. Now after a long time when Vinay returns home with his son, his special bond with Meera develops again with Meera reciprocating the feeling as well. On a parallel track, a corrupt Mayor - Durai (Ashish Vidyarthi)- is fighting an issue of an old dam in his area. Towards the end a leak is discovered inside the dam, and when a heavy storm and rains hit on the same day, a high alert is declared.",78657b8858bb44d9cb5f947d4fb403f2,Who is Sam's father in love with?,Meera,"Meera sacrificed her love, and thus Vinay married Sandra",bert,2852db514a306d7239b0a59c94a2b23a,Who is Sam's father in love with?,Meera,Sandra,bert,5a125522e1b412c20b60c2bdce6cca64,Who is Sam's father in love with?,Meera,Shankaran.,bert,638317130bd58848df8dae46b1f95c73,Who is Sam's father in love with?,Meera,"Vinay,",bert,aa6840ec2fae1dad37c401a65b1a2302,Who is the Vaidyan's son?,Vinay,Sam,bert,c0b132d8cc41ff5dcf32c161b5fd8f8c,Who is the Vaidyan's son?,Vinay,Sam to meet his father Shankaran.,bert,659d5e380834d0dec27c7fbf9e640b0c,Who is the Vaidyan's son?,Vinay,Sam to meet his father Shankaran.

"The story opens with Georges Iscovescu recounting his story to a Hollywood film director at Paramount in an effort to earn some quick cash. Georges is a Romanian-born gigolo who has arrived in a Mexican border town seeking entry to the US. He has to endure a waiting period of up to eight years in order to obtain a quota number, living with other hopeful immigrants in the Esperanza Hotel. After six months he is broke and unhappy. When he runs into his former dancing partner Anita Dixon she explains how she quickly obtained US citizenship by marrying an American, who she then, just as quickly, divorced. Georges resolves on the same plan. He soon targets visiting school teacher Miss Emmy Brown, who is in Mexico on a day trip with her class of about fifteen young boys. Georges manages to extend the time necessary to repair her broken down automobile.  Emmy and her pupils sleep in the lobby of the full-up Esperanza Hotel.  This provides Georges the opportunity to quickly and intensively woo Emmy in the early morning hours; she awakens to him sitting nearby and gazing at her lovingly. By claiming she is the exact image of the lost love of his life, his seemingly intense ardor toward a stranger is plausible, and they marry later that same day.

When he runs into his former dancing partner Anita Dixon she explains how she quickly obtained US citizenship by marrying an American, who she then, just as quickly, divorced. Georges resolves on the same plan. He soon targets visiting school teacher Miss Emmy Brown, who is in Mexico on a day trip with her class of about fifteen young boys. Georges manages to extend the time necessary to repair her broken down automobile.  Emmy and her pupils sleep in the lobby of the full-up Esperanza Hotel.  This provides Georges the opportunity to quickly and intensively woo Emmy in the early morning hours; she awakens to him sitting nearby and gazing at her lovingly. By claiming she is the exact image of the lost love of his life, his seemingly intense ardor toward a stranger is plausible, and they marry later that same day. However, George must wait some weeks before entering the US, and Emmy returns home with the boys.",0ff89ff8a85f8591720281fc728bdb8e,What is the full name of the person who has to wait eight years for a quota number?,Georges Iscovescu,"Miss Emmy Brown,",bert,bfe2f16d7f052477ca46dee46cd94c44,What is the full name of the person who has to wait eight years for a quota number?,Georges Iscovescu,cu,bert,2c5437d22d5af53d8bada7eb1fbeca47,What is the full name of the person who is broke and unhappy after six months in the Mexican border town?,Georges Iscovescu,"Emmy Brown,",bert,e5be50ab051a010ff106a38e0b4b08ad,What is the full name of the person who is broke and unhappy after six months in the Mexican border town?,Georges Iscovescu,Georges,bert,65661227cea0be474bc716a73ceaff5c,What is the full name of the person who is broke and unhappy after six months in the Mexican border town?,Georges Iscovescu,Georges Iscovescu recounting his story to a Hollywood film director at Paramount in an effort to earn some quick cash.

"The symphony was dedicated to Górecki's wife Jadwiga Rurańska. When asked why, Górecki responded, ""Who was I supposed to dedicate it to?"" He never sought to explain the symphony as a response to a political or historical event. Instead, he maintained that the work is an evocation of the ties between mother and child.  Górecki was commissioned to write music in response to the Holocaust in the 1960s but was unable to finish any of the pieces he started for that purpose. While Górecki stated that for many years he sought to produce a work specifically in response to Auschwitz, he resisted that interpretation of the symphony, which he preferred to be viewed in a wider context. Other critics have attempted to interpret the symphony in spiritual terms, an approach which Górecki also dismissed. Still others have suggested that the symphony can be understood as a compendium of Polish history: The symphony alludes to each of the main historical and political developments in Poland's history from the 14th century to 1976, the year of its composition. What is more, each of the three movements appears to represent a different age . . . and [they are] chronologically contiguous. The composer seems to have created three separate and discrete ""chapters"" in his summary of Poland's history. Górecki said of the work, ""Many of my family died in concentration camps. I had a grandfather who was in Dachau, an aunt in Auschwitz. You know how it is between Poles and Germans. But Bach was a German too—and Schubert, and Strauss. Everyone has his place on this little earth. That's all behind me. So the Third Symphony is not about war; it's not a Dies Irae; it's a normal Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.""",65ab8b5812df1c365f7ad00d886a88b1,What is the last name of the person who had an aunt at Auschwitz?,Górecki,Górecki's,bert,77760b4c81d9888728ce71d92113d172,What is the last name of the person who had an aunt at Auschwitz?,Górecki,"Górecki's wife Jadwiga Rurańska.

"The tracks ""Countdown"" and ""End of Time"" were distinguished by their musical and lyrical experimentalism. ""Countdown"" was described as ""everywhere on the genre map"", although predominantly dancehall-led with a ""bristling brass arrangement"". Its chorus describes a relationship by counting backwards from ten, using a sample from Boyz II Men's ""Uhh Ahh"". ""End of Time""'s pulsating, brass sound—reminiscent of a marching-band—was heavily influenced by Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti. Kuti's use of horns and percussion instruments was recreated and combined with elements of electronic music and synthesizers. ""Lay Up Under Me"" is also built on retro horns, featuring upbeat vocals, a sound Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork associated with Michael Jackson's 1979 album Off the Wall.Other tracks were noted for their retro stylization. ""Rather Die Young"" is a throwback to 1960s doo-wop and Philadelphia soul, with a slow tempo and modern drums. ""Party"" achieves a vintage aesthetic through minimalistic production, replete with heavy synthesizers and a 1980s smooth-funk groove.

"There are two major valleys in the park, Death Valley and Panamint Valley. Both of these valleys were formed within the last few million years and both are bounded by north–south-trending mountain ranges. These and adjacent valleys follow the general trend of Basin and Range topography with one modification: there are parallel strike-slip faults that perpendicularly bound the central extent of Death Valley. The result of this shearing action is additional extension in the central part of Death Valley which causes a slight widening and more subsidence there. Uplift of surrounding mountain ranges and subsidence of the valley floor are both occurring. The uplift on the Black Mountains is so fast that the alluvial fans (fan-shaped deposits at the mouth of canyons) there are small and steep compared to the huge alluvial fans coming off the Panamint Range. Fast uplift of a mountain range in an arid environment often does not allow its canyons enough time to cut a classic V-shape all the way down to the stream bed. Instead, a V-shape ends at a slot canyon halfway down, forming a 'wine glass canyon.'  Sediment is deposited on a small and steep alluvial fan. At 282 feet (86 m) below sea level at its lowest point, Badwater Basin on Death Valley's floor is the second-lowest depression in the Western Hemisphere (behind Laguna del Carbón in Argentina), while Mount Whitney, only 85 miles (137 km) to the west, rises to 14,505 feet (4,421 m). This topographic relief is the greatest elevation gradient in the contiguous United States and is the terminus point of the Great Basin's southwestern drainage. Although the extreme lack of water in the Great Basin makes this distinction of little current practical use, it does mean that in wetter times the lake that once filled Death Valley (Lake Manly) was the last stop for water flowing in the region, meaning the water there was saturated in dissolved materials. Thus the salt pans in Death Valley are among the largest in the world and are rich in minerals, such as borax and various salts and hydrates. The largest salt pan in the park extends 40 miles (64 km) from the Ashford Mill Site to the Salt Creek Hills, covering some 200 square miles (520 km2) of the valley floor. The best known playa in the park is the Racetrack, known for its moving rocks.",2c425a9e79e27bb27d0146be1a450e6b,What is the lowest point of Death Valley?,Badwater Basin,282,bert,f8ec8301246fdcd0bc5274f4ffefa725,What is the lowest point of Death Valley?,Badwater Basin,282 feet,bert,dfe229d2f993ad802d8c0a11edd18e64,What is the lowest point of Death Valley?,Badwater Basin,Panamint Valley.,bert,03ac8be82a8fc7f916bcf3e638d8a275,What location has the largest salt pans in the world?,Death Valley,Ashford Mill Site,bert,683e728f6dab91e767cf6c98ac1b658f,What location has the largest salt pans in the world?,Death Valley,Death,bert,9c2aadf1fb8975dfc6dc5b4f6398a4c8,What location has the largest salt pans in the world?,Death Valley,Valley,bert,355a37ade0a97406ffeb75f76d831646,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"There is considerable uncertainty about the identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption of power in 1295. This is in part because the two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him. The Gediminid dynasty began its ascent in Lithuania during this time with the emergence of its first leader, Butigeidis. In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, he attacked Sambia. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in present-day Sovetsk (Tilsit) and their raids intensified. Butigeidis was the first to build strong castles along the Neman River. He died in 1290 or 1292, and his brother Butvydas (also known as Pukuveras) inherited the crown. Butvydas was the father of Vytenis and probably of Gediminas. During his short reign Butvydas tried to defend the duchy against the Teutonic Knights; he also attacked Masovia, an ally of the knights.

"Todd Acosta, his girlfriend Sarah Fletcher, and their new carpooling friends Jodi, Keren, Jeff, and Eric become stranded on a remote country road when their SUV suffers a tire blowout. While changing the tire, Jeff is suddenly killed by silent sniper fire. The unseen sniper shoots Sarah next, prompting Eric to take cover behind a tree stump while Jodi, Keren, and Todd hide behind the vehicle. The sniper shoots a cellphone off a selfie stick when the trio behind the vehicle tries getting a signal to call 911. Keren uses her hoodie to create a distraction while Todd, who is additionally suffering from a slug lodged in his arm, unsuccessfully attempts to put the SUV in neutral so it can be moved for rolling cover. Eric uses a video shot from his cellphone camera to determine the sniper's position. Todd retrieves a toolbox and duct tapes its metal lid to his arm for protection. Although he takes another shot in the process, Todd manages to get the SUV rolling on his second attempt. However, the SUV rolls in the opposite direction until the sniper shoots out another tire and disables it. Eric tries running toward nearby trees in the commotion. The sniper shoots Eric in his ankle as well as his leg. Eric hits the ground and eventually passes out. Keren uses a lighter to heat a hammerhead for cauterizing Todd's arm wound. After retrieving a water bottle from the backseat and taking swigs themselves, the trio tosses the bottle to Eric. The sniper shoots Eric through his hand when he tries taking a sip. During a quiet moment, Todd tells Jodi and Keren that his girlfriend Sarah was pregnant, but lost their baby. Lost in reflection and losing hope, Todd goes to drape a shirt over Sarah's face.

"Trudie is an aspiring painter working as a restaurant waitress. With the pressure to please her parents (Timothy Bottoms and Markie Post) building, she misses a job interview and gets dumped by her boyfriend just before Christmas, and she has a nervous breakdown. Stressed about going home for the holidays without a boyfriend, she kidnaps David Martin, a random customer at the restaurant in which she works and introduces him to her parents as her boyfriend, Nick.  Trudie's family is vacationing at a very isolated log cabin miles away from anyone else, so David is unable to escape, although he makes several attempts. He finally decides to play along until the police come, but he ultimately falls in love with Trudie and understands the family pressure that made her feel forced to kidnap him in the first place. During Christmas dinner, the holiday comes to an abrupt end when Trudie's parents begin to fight, her brother Jake announces that he is gay, and her sister Katie says that she has quit law school and bought a pilates studio with her parents' tuition money. The police then arrive and arrest the family during Christmas dinner, revealing that David Martin is not actually Trudie's boyfriend.  Before he was kidnapped, David had a successful job and a beautiful, rich girlfriend; however, during his time with Trudie and her family, he realizes his life has developed into something he did not intend.

"Trudy Kockenlocker is a small-town girl with a soft spot for soldiers. She wakes up one morning after a wild farewell party for a group of them to find that while drunk the night before, she married a soldier whose name she can't remember, except that ""it had a z in it. Like Ratzkywatzky [...] or was it Zitzkywitzky?"" She believes they both used fake names and she doesn't know how to get in touch with him or even what he looks like. The matter is complicated when she learns that she became pregnant that night as well.  Norval Jones, a local 4-F boy who has been in love with Trudy for years, steps in to help out, but Trudy's over-protective father, a policeman, gets involved and complicates matters. Before long, Norval is arrested on 19 different charges, and then he finds himself on the run as an escaped prisoner. All seems lost until Trudy gives birth to sextuplets. At that point Governor McGinty and The Boss step in and provide a phone call which results in a happy ending for everyone. When Norval discovers that Trudy has borne not just one son but six, he faints, and the movie ends with this epilogue on a title card:But Norval recovered andbecame increasingly happyfor, as Shakespeare said:""Some are born great, someachieve greatness, and somehave greatness thrust uponthem.""        THE END",ccad48d0deac3233c47717c132e5a65f,Who is the policeman's daughter partial to?,soldiers,Ratzkywatzky,bert,c20875521ca65b4259f516210e351f33,Who is the policeman's daughter partial to?,soldiers,a soldier,bert,fd10fbce0fc861b00a5b79a577d902c8,Who is the policeman's daughter partial to?,soldiers,"a soldier whose name she can't remember, except that ""it had a z in it.

"Two aliens, Nukie and Miko, spend their time flying through space in the form of stars and looking for fun. The two come across the planet Earth and, while trying to survey the planet, get caught in its gravitational pull and end up crash landing. During the crash, the two are separated, with Nukie ending up in the African savanna and Miko falling into the hands of a Space Federation in the United States. Upon discovering Miko's crash site, the agency take the alien in to perform tests on him, while Miko cries out for Nukie. Miko reaches out to Nukie telepathically and informs him that he is being held captive in America. The head of the operation, Dr. Glynn sends Dr. Eric Harvey to Nairobi to investigate the other crash site. During their experiments, the scientists discover that Miko is a being made of pure energy. Nukie, meanwhile, begins to explore his surroundings, attempting to communicate telepathically with the animals he encounters to ascertain the location of America. The animals don't understand and – much to Nukie's frustration – run away. He then comes across two children, Tiko and Toki, who seem to be able to understand Nukie. He asks them for their help with finding America, but they run off vowing not to tell anybody about what has happened. In America, Miko is subjected to more painful testing to explore his physical makeup. Miko's brain patterns show images of the animals which Nukie sees, indicating that Nukie is transmitting his brainwaves to Miko. Nukie decides to rest in the shade of a tree, turning invisible as he does so. Tiko and Toki pass by and Nukie is awoken by a flock of birds, becoming visible once more.

"Two pairs of friends, Matteo and Francesca & Shary and Diego, decide to spend the summer together in a beach house at the foot of Mount Circeo. Matteo,  a psychologist, is married to Francesca with whom he has a five-year-old girl, Elena. Diego and Shary have a less stable relationship, having a son together, David, who attends college in the United States. David comes to Italy for the first time in five years to spend time with his family and celebrate his birthday. Upon David's arrival, he and Matteo begin to develop feelings for each other. Only Leonard, Shary's brother, who has returned from his travels around the world to spend some time with the two pairs, seems to sense what is happening. The balance of Matteo's marriage begins to crack, and the growing tension seems to corrode the two families. While the rest of the household is out preparing for David's birthday party, Matteo goes to David's bedroom, and they have sex.  When Francesca returns, she has no front-door keys and enters the house through a patio door into David's room where she finds the two men having sex.  She runs out, and Matteo runs after her.  She dashes around a corner and into the street where she is hit and killed by a car. Later, Matteo, Shary, Diego, and David are having supper. Shary asks Matteo accusingly where he was at the time of the accident, and the movie ends as he begins to cry from guilt.",98aa56f26b83b18d0a1f050b639ff97f,What are the names of everyone David is related to mentioned in the story?,Diego,Francesca & Shary,bert,749acbc36c52a5a9352de441abc2f7df,What are the names of everyone David is related to mentioned in the story?,Diego,Matteo,bert,022378e9f48d29820755f85409f3b969,What are the names of everyone David is related to mentioned in the story?,Diego,Matteo and Francesca,bert,01be46e53c9836a3685c56341c6a2b33,What are the names of everyone David is related to mentioned in the story?,Diego,Matteo and Francesca & Shary,bert,590dcb40fcd9f36444db9e6021fe5e89,What are the names of everyone David is related to mentioned in the story?,Diego,"Matteo, Shary,",bert,47b3e66887b1c3624663d4e085b53d61,What is the name of the person who is hit and killed by a car?,Francesca,David's,bert,18346972624109325510609bcb941b73,What is the name of the person who is hit and killed by a car?,Francesca,"David's room where she finds the two men having sex.

"Two songs, ""Kreuzberg"" and ""I Still Remember"", explore sexuality and homosexuality; the former is an account of promiscuity in the Berlin area of the same name, while the latter details an unrequited crush of a boy for his schoolmate.The leading track, ""Song for Clay (Disappear Here)"", was inspired by Less Than Zero, a novel by Bret Easton Ellis which depicts excessive hedonism and its effects on individuals. The song title references the protagonist Clay and a billboard in the book which displays the phrase ""Disappear Here"", while the action is relocated to Les Trois Garçons restaurant in Shoreditch, East London. ""Waiting for the 7.18"" provides an escapist counterpoint by mentioning a trip to Brighton following disillusionment with working life in the capital. The fifth song on A Weekend in the City, ""Uniform"", references London again and criticises the youth subculture in the area. It is directly inspired by Douglas Rushkoff's Merchants of Cool documentary, which details the corporate exploitation of popular culture by advertisement companies.Okereke read Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle and Henri Lefebvre's Critique of Everyday Life, works which analyse how people experience leisure in modern societies, and was inspired to pen several songs which detail the drug and drink culture present in a metropolis. ""The Prayer"" is based on drug use during nights out in clubs, while ""On"" specifies the effects and after-effects of cocaine. Okereke tried to treat the tracks as explanations of people's actions, rather than moralising tales; he has stated, ""In a time when so many people feel they can't communicate or feel hemmed in, I can see the appeal of cocaine."" ""Sunday"" details the morning-after hangover following a drunken and promiscuous night out, while ""SRXT"" takes the form of a suicide note following the loneliness and despair of hedonism in the metropolis.

"Unbeknownst to humans, there is a thriving, technologically sophisticated society of Martians living below the surface of Mars. The Martians Supervisor, while observing Earth, sees a mother persuading her son, Milo, to do his chores. The Martians decide to bring her to Mars, where her ""momness"" will be extracted and implanted into the next generation of nannybots. Meanwhile, Milo - who doesn't like following the house rules and doing chores and has been grounded as a result, tells his mother sarcastically that his life would be better without her, breaking her heart. Later that night, Milo goes to apologize, but discovers his mom is being abducted. He runs after her, but they end up in separate parts of the Martian spaceship. On Mars, Milo is taken to an underground cell. He escapes and is chased by Martian guards, but he follows a voice that tells him to jump down a chute, and lands in a lower subterranean level. There, he sees a trash-covered landscape that is inhabited by furry creatures. Milo is whisked away by the creatures to meet Gribble, a.k.a. George Ribble, the childlike adult human who had told him to jump down the chute. Gribble explains to Milo that the Martians plan to extract Milo's Mom's memories at sunrise, using a process that will kill her. Gribble, who is lonely and doesn't want Milo to leave, pretends to help Milo rescue his mother. His plan goes awry, leading to Gribble being captured and Milo being pursued by Martian guards. Milo is rescued by Ki, one of the supervisors who raise Martian babies. Milo tells her about his search for his Mom and what a human relationship with a mom is like, as Ki and her kin were mentored by only nannybots and supervisors and don't know of love.",42892ce0bba1863a578b24097f67437f,What is the real name of the person Milo was whisked away to meet?,George Ribble,George,bert,e7075e4434b4f5901e24c403715c5272,What is the real name of the person Milo was whisked away to meet?,George Ribble,"Gribble,",bert,9bff188126026b4a2d2224160aba3938,What is the real name of the person Milo was whisked away to meet?,George Ribble,"Gribble, a.k.a.

"Valley View is a mid-19th-century Greek Revival residence and farm overlooking the South Branch Potomac River northwest of Romney, West Virginia. Valley View is atop a promontory where Depot Valley joins the South Branch Potomac River valley. The Valley View property was part of the South Branch Survey of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a large tract that was inherited by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, in 1719. It was settled by John Collins and his family in 1749, and acquired by the Parsons family before 1772. The Valley View house was built by James Parsons Jr. in 1855. After the Civil War, Parsons' widow sold the farm to Charles Harmison. His wife, Elizabeth Harmison, inspired by her childhood Virginia home, Western View, and the scenic South Branch Potomac River views, named the farm Valley View. The most recent of a series of owners, the Mayhew family, bought the property in 1979. Valley View's current proprietors, Robert and Kim Mayhew, have restored the historic residence and grounds. The house at Valley View is a two-story brick structure with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance is covered by a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear of the house, with a two-story wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden trim, and materials in the main section of the house are intact.

"Virginia is the most populous U.S. state without a major professional sports league franchise. The reasons for this include the lack of any dominant city or market within the state, the proximity of teams in Washington, D.C. and North Carolina, and a reluctance to publicly finance stadiums. However, in recent years, the city of Virginia Beach has proposed a new arena designed to lure a major league franchise. Norfolk is host to two minor league teams: The AAA Norfolk Tides and the ECHL's Norfolk Admirals. The San Francisco Giants' AA team, the Richmond Flying Squirrels, began play at The Diamond in 2010, replacing the AAA Richmond Braves, who relocated after 2008. Additionally, the Washington Nationals, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, and Toronto Blue Jays  also have Single-A and Rookie-level farm teams in Virginia. The state is also home to United Soccer League club, the Richmond Kickers.The Washington Redskins have Redskins Park, their headquarters, in Ashburn and their training facility is in Richmond, and the Washington Capitals train at Kettler Capitals Iceplex in Ballston. Virginia has many professional caliber golf courses including the Greg Norman course at Lansdowne Resort and Kingsmill Resort, home of the Kingsmill Championship, an LPGA Tour tournament. NASCAR currently schedules Monster Energy NASCAR Cup races on two tracks in Virginia: Martinsville Speedway and Richmond Raceway. Virginia natives currently competing in the series include Denny Hamlin and Elliott Sadler. Virginia does not allow state appropriated funds to be used for either operational or capital expenses for intercollegiate athletics. Despite this, both the Virginia Cavaliers and Virginia Tech Hokies have been able to field competitive teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference and maintain modern facilities. Their rivalry is followed statewide. Twelve other universities compete in NCAA Division I, particularly in the Atlantic 10 Conference, Big South Conference, and Colonial Athletic Association. Three historically black schools compete in the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and two others compete in the Division I Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. Several smaller schools compete in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference and the USA South Athletic Conference of NCAA Division III.

"Wallace was born in St. Mary's Hospital in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, on May 21, 1972, the only child of Jamaican parents, Voletta Wallace, a preschool teacher, and Selwyn George Latore, a welder and politician. His father left the family when Wallace was two years old, and his mother worked two jobs while raising him. Wallace grew up in Clinton Hill, on 226 St. James Place, near the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.At Queen of All Saints Middle School, Wallace excelled, winning several awards as an English student. He was nicknamed ""Big"" because of his overweight size by age 10. He said he started dealing drugs when he was around the age of 12. His mother, often away at work, did not know of his drug dealing until he was an adult. Wallace began rapping as a teenager, entertaining people on the streets and performed with local groups the Old Gold Brothers and the Techniques.At his request, Wallace transferred from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School to George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, where future rappers DMX, Jay-Z and Busta Rhymes were also attending. According to his mother, Wallace was still a good student but developed a ""smart-ass"" attitude at the new school. At seventeen, Wallace dropped out of school and became more involved in crime. In 1989, he was arrested on weapons charges in Brooklyn and sentenced to five years' probation. In 1990, he was arrested on a violation of his probation. A year later, Wallace was arrested in North Carolina for dealing crack cocaine. He spent nine months in jail before making bail.",d3121e2f9f0420d9781dea277c6bc1bc,What is the full name of the person that left the family when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"George Latore,",bert,4f8862cb4e9ad6b1cc6f05b40fcec2b5,What is the full name of the person that left the family when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Latore,",bert,65995d129b504cb0ff43af840b50349d,What is the full name of the person that left the family when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,Voletta,bert,81fe06c6ff2bb8d6865d8bb99c318e79,What is the full name of the person that left the family when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Voletta Wallace,",bert,bdb93d7705a7298fabf8d19ced51d742,What is the full name of the person that left the family when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Voletta Wallace, a preschool teacher, and Selwyn George Latore,",bert,495a7273a9b0292b2ec391bbb29ec87f,What is the full name of the person that left when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"George Latore,",bert,bf886198133cbf9cfab44e769d696bce,What is the full name of the person that left when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Latore,",bert,c72b3a196e6fe03bddb85db6a4a39d8e,What is the full name of the person that left when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,Selwyn George,bert,53775feb43c73de409b7d06d513059c6,What is the full name of the person that left when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Voletta Wallace,",bert,d9abf27dc634c63763f9b2707da2d5ec,What is the full name of the person that left when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Voletta Wallace, a preschool teacher, and Selwyn George Latore,",bert,15135d127212a2718921f229e40b681f,What is the full name of the person that worked two jobs while raising Wallace?,Voletta Wallace,"George Latore,",bert,e1a0f021b0ec7d6e42c481b7b3109d06,What is the full name of the person that worked two jobs while raising Wallace?,Voletta Wallace,"Latore,",bert,c42c7f9043b8ab2fd34b247559ff6306,What is the full name of the person that worked two jobs while raising Wallace?,Voletta Wallace,Selwyn,bert,c407e355ecfca7eea8cfcc9496d833c8,What is the full name of the person that worked two jobs while raising Wallace?,Voletta Wallace,"Selwyn George Latore,",bert,4d0df6a25564f83357eedd4bffabe416,What is the full name of the person that worked two jobs while raising Wallace?,Voletta Wallace,"Voletta Wallace, a preschool teacher, and Selwyn George Latore,",bert,6056f13ed694ac0593675acdec423474,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913–2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914–1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey. His father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member. In the early years of the Second World War, Waters' father was a conscientious objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz.Waters' father later changed his stance on pacifism, joined the Territorial Army and was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943. He was killed five months later on 18 February 1944 at Aprilia, during the Battle of Anzio, when Roger was five months old. He is commemorated at the Cassino War Cemetery. On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio. Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there. Waters' earliest memory is of the V-J Day celebrations.Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College) with Syd Barrett, while future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour lived nearby on Mill Road and attended the Perse School.

"Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913–2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914–1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey. His father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member. In the early years of the Second World War, Waters' father was a conscientious objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz.Waters' father later changed his stance on pacifism, joined the Territorial Army and was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943. He was killed five months later on 18 February 1944 at Aprilia, during the Battle of Anzio, when Roger was five months old. He is commemorated at the Cassino War Cemetery. On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio. Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there. Waters' earliest memory is of the V-J Day celebrations.Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College) with Syd Barrett, while future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour lived nearby on Mill Road and attended the Perse School. At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND), having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation. He was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school's cricket and rugby teams. Waters was unhappy at school, saying: ""I hated every second of it, apart from games.

"West Point cadet Rockwell ""Rocky"" Gilman is called before a hearing brought after an influential cadet, Raymond Denmore, Jr., is forced to leave the academy. Gilman has reported Denmore for lying to him during training, and in retaliation has been accused of bullying and hazing the dismissed cadet. Denmore's attorney, Lew Proctor, attacking the academy and its Honor Code system, declares that Gilman is unfit and possibly criminally liable. Gilman is confined to quarters by the academy superintendent and warned not to discuss the case with anyone. Consequently, he breaks a date his girlfriend Ann Daniels without explanation. The hearing resumes and Gilman's classmate, Eddie Loughlin, recounts how Gilman uncomplainingly withstood the rigors of academy training, especially during his plebe year, when he was still recovering from war wounds. Gilman takes the stand and testifies about his war experiences. Unwillingly drafted in December 1941, he learned by bitter experience that all soldiers in combat must obey their superiors unquestioningly. As a result, he applied for and completed officer candidate school. Gilman joined a unit going into combat in North Africa and became friends with both Loughlin and West Point graduate Lt. Harry Daniels. Daniels was killed in action and Gilman wounded during a battle in Tunisia, after which Gilman spent two years recovering in an Army hospital. Although awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for destroying an enemy tank during the action, Gilman turned down the medal. After his discharge from the Army, Gilman returned home to Brooklyn where he learned that his former sweetheart had married in his absence. Gilman changed numerous jobs before realizing that he cannot adjust to civilian life. On the evening of V-E Day, as the city celebrated, Gilman became depressed, feeling that people were dancing on the graves of countless soldiers, and instead went to see Daniels' family and his widow Ann.",6bad78bb488c40c6f68dc69005ffb230,What is the first name of the person that testifies for Rocky at the hearing?,Eddie,Ann,bert,e7605314ac95dff30289e47494d33318,What is the first name of the person that testifies for Rocky at the hearing?,Eddie,"Ann Daniels without explanation.

"When American diplomat William Gridley arrives in London, he rents part of Carly Hardwicke's (Kim Novak) house from her and promptly begins to fall in love. Gridley doesn't know that many people think she killed her British husband, Miles Hardwick, because he has disappeared; but without a body, the police cannot do a thing. Gridley's boss is Franklyn Ambruster, a State Department chief in the American embassy who learns about it and doesn't take this ""lapse of judgment"" lightly. A Scotland Yard detective arrives at the embassy and convinces Gridley, who by this time is in love with Carly, to spy on her without letting her realize she is being investigated.

"When Boston Blackie performs magic tricks at a Thanksgiving Day party for the inmates of a women's prison, Dinah Moran volunteers to enter a booth. She disappears after he draws the curtain, but as a former magician's assistant, uses the opportunity to escape. Police Inspector Farraday takes Blackie into custody as an accomplice, but Blackie easily gets away himself. A trip to the library reveals that Dinah was sent to prison for three years for a robbery that netted $100,000 (which was never recovered) and a dead victim. Her magician former husband, John Lampau, was acquitted. Blackie tracks Lampau down, still performing magic, but now under the name of Jani, to warn him. Dinah shows up minutes later, having heard that Jani intends to marry his new assistant, Irene. Dinah has come to make sure she gets her half of the loot. In a scuffle, she grazes Jani's right hand with a gunshot before fleeing. Blackie arranges to impersonate Jani, while the magician hides in Blackie's absent friend's apartment. That night, Blackie is awoken by sounds in Jani's apartment. When he investigates, a woman runs out of the unlit room.  Blackie eventually locates the money in Jani's safety deposit box and takes it, still disguised as Jani. Outside, Dinah forces him at gunpoint to give her the envelope containing the loot, but when she opens it, it is empty. Blackie had taken the precaution of pocketing the money. In the meantime, Blackie's friend returns home from a trip early and finds Jani's body in the closet. Farraday corners and arrests Blackie and his sidekick, ""the Runt"" (George E.

"When Brooklyn burlesque showgirl Maisie Ravier arrives at a small Wyoming town, she finds her new employer has folded after a single performance, leaving her stranded and nearly penniless. She persuades Rico to hire her for his midway shooting gallery. Her first customer is the unfriendly ""Slim"" Martin, the manager of a ranch. Slim accidentally drops his wallet full of money. Rico picks it up and leaves town. Slim has Maisie arrested for theft, but when a search finds she only has 15 cents, he admits his mistake. The deputy sheriff informs Maisie that as a vagrant, she must leave town by midnight, so she hides in the back of Slim's truck. When Slim returns to the ranch, he is displeased to discover the stowaway. He has Maisie driven to the railway station the next morning. Maisie meets the ranch owners, Cliff and Sybil Ames, who arrive on the train. Maisie fast-talks herself into being hired as Sybil's maid. The Ameses are trying to rebuild their marriage after Cliff discovered Sybil's extramarital affair with Richard ""Ray"" Raymond. Maisie's warm personality gradually overcomes Slim's hostility. Slim's demeanor is the result of past hard luck: he confessed to embezzlement to protect his girlfriend and spent a year in prison, only to discover after his release that she had run off with another man. Maisie also becomes friends with Cliff. Maisie and Cliff volunteer to drive needed supplies to the old ranch house but their car overturns and Cliff is pinned under the wreck. Maisie limps to the house and walks in on Sybil kissing Ray Raymond.

"When charter-boat skipper Jack O'Conner finds a gold Spanish dollar off the Florida Keys, he decides to go in search of a legendary hoard of Spanish doubloons sunk during the ""Hundred Years Storm"" of 1780. For, as Jack's friend Cap'n Billau reveals, the coin bears a clue to the treasure's whereabouts – one of four islands etched by the infamous pirate, Jacques Un-Oeil upon the original doubloon. At Billau's urging, Jack tracks down the two beautiful women who unknowingly hold the remaining clues. Streetwise Sandy Sequoia's piece of eight came from her murdered drug dealer boyfriend in Miami. And lonely-heart Portia Pennington inherited her coin from her merchant tycoon grandfather, who died at sea in the ""Hundred Years Storm"" of 1893, while hunting for the lost gold. Jack convinces the girls to go in search of the pirate treasure with him. But first, the two must learn to crew his 76' schooner; and then, all three adventurers must learn to trust one another, if they expect to navigate the treacheries of love and the unpredictable Caribbean.

"When charter-boat skipper Jack O'Conner finds a gold Spanish dollar off the Florida Keys, he decides to go in search of a legendary hoard of Spanish doubloons sunk during the ""Hundred Years Storm"" of 1780. For, as Jack's friend Cap'n Billau reveals, the coin bears a clue to the treasure's whereabouts – one of four islands etched by the infamous pirate, Jacques Un-Oeil upon the original doubloon. At Billau's urging, Jack tracks down the two beautiful women who unknowingly hold the remaining clues. Streetwise Sandy Sequoia's piece of eight came from her murdered drug dealer boyfriend in Miami. And lonely-heart Portia Pennington inherited her coin from her merchant tycoon grandfather, who died at sea in the ""Hundred Years Storm"" of 1893, while hunting for the lost gold. Jack convinces the girls to go in search of the pirate treasure with him. But first, the two must learn to crew his 76' schooner; and then, all three adventurers must learn to trust one another, if they expect to navigate the treacheries of love and the unpredictable Caribbean. As Jack introduces the girls to life at sea, he starts to fall in love with Sandy. All seems to be going well, until Jack discovers Sandy with drugs on his boat – a kilo of her dead boyfriend's cocaine (which she has steadily been using since coming aboard). He has Portia dump the coke overboard; and while Sandy wrestles to overcome her addiction, Jack turns his attentions to Portia. When Sandy and Portia realize that Jack has seduced each of them in turn and convinced each to reveal to him the name of the island on her coin, they turn on him. Feeling betrayed and realizing that they no longer need Jack in order to sail the boat or find the gold, they maroon him on a small island and go after the sunken treasure themselves.",8688d2a248c59be8bfe87a8c170bb836,What is the last name of the person who finds out that Sandy has drugs on the boat?,O'Conner,Pennington,bert,a0feb55bde5615ed72484e28a3b38ded,What is the last name of the person who finds out that Sandy has drugs on the boat?,O'Conner,o,bert,6af40a769b74bb3f6047ff8698d55bd1,What is the last name of the person who is friends with Cap'n Billau?,O'Conner,Jack O'Conner,bert,1eaaef3f567655794b12d7dedd9c6077,What is the last name of the person who is friends with Cap'n Billau?,O'Conner,Pennington,bert,c11abd5b8c7f956f1e277e12c8d37416,What is the last name of the person who is friends with Cap'n Billau?,O'Conner,Sequoia's,bert,0bbe9c61893876bacfdc3a8a931e392f,What is the last name of the person who is friends with Cap'n Billau?,O'Conner,Sequoia's piece of eight came from her murdered drug dealer boyfriend in Miami.

"When the convention adjourned on April 13,  Austin went directly to San Antonio de Béxar to meet with Seguin.  Seguin called a series of meetings, held from May 3 to 5, for prominent locals to discuss the convention proceedings.  He was the only Béxar resident to fully support separate statehood.  Other residents suggested that the capital of Coahuila y Tejas should be moved to San Antonio de Béxar, giving Texas more power.  There was precedent for this; under Veramendi, the capital had just been moved from Saltillo to Monclova.  If the legislature rejected the move, these residents vowed to support separate statehood.A third group of residents believed that the convention, like its predecessor, was illegal.  Under their interpretation of the laws, only the state legislature would be able to petition the Mexican Congress for such a drastic change.  Austin argued that the laws really meant that no one could petition on behalf of the people unless the people had been consulted, and the convention served as that consultation.  The meetings ended with no agreement on how to proceed.  Austin wrote that ""the people here agree in substance with the rest of Texas, but differ as to the manner, and will express no opinion for, nor against"".Seguin declined to accompany Austin. Miller also withdrew.  Texas was in the throes of a cholera epidemic, and Miller, a physician, felt it his duty to stay and tend the sick.  Austin then visited Goliad but was unable to attract any more Tejano support.  He chose to go to Mexico City alone; he had visited several times and had established a good reputation among government officials.

"While Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks and parts of the surrounding Tioga State Forest are now the Pine Creek Gorge National Natural Landmark, it is their status as part of a Pennsylvania State Natural Area that provides the strongest protection for them. Within this Natural Area, logging, mining, and drilling for oil and gas are prohibited.  Furthermore, only foot trail access is allowed. In 1988 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, precursor to the DCNR, described it as about 95% State owned, unroaded, and designated the Pine Creek Gorge Natural Area. It is a place of unique geologic history and contains some rare plant communities, an old growth hemlock stand, ... active bald eagle nest[s] ... and is a major site of river otter reintroduction. Departmental policy is protection of the natural values of the Canyon from development and overuse, and restoration of the area to as near a natural condition as possible. Fishers, medium-sized weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge as part of an effort to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.",f687f2840d8389f7a12f12b7f33cae13,What type of animal is a generalized predator that will hunt any smaller creature in their territory?,medium-sized weasels,"Fishers,",bert,f4516c534c1335acde2fd2248cef9365,What type of animal is a generalized predator that will hunt any smaller creature in their territory?,medium-sized weasels,fisher,bert,c97d536df4f82fcd4164242226a84391,What type of animal is a generalized predator that will hunt any smaller creature in their territory?,medium-sized weasels,"fishers in Pennsylvania.

"While Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate Henry Cobb had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. John Hancock Insurance chairman Robert Slater hired I. M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the Prudential Tower, erected by their rival.After the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the Trinity Church and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a ""background and foil"" to the older structures around it. When the Hancock Tower was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in New England. Serious issues of execution became evident in the tower almost immediately. Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. In response, the entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels. This significantly increased the cost of the project. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I. M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were ""not good and workmanlike"". LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I. M. Pei & Partners sued LOF in return. All three companies settled out of court in 1981.The project became an albatross for Pei's firm. Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in Australia and Pei took on jobs in Singapore, Iran, and Kuwait. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. ""Going through this trial toughened us,"" he said. ""It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other.""",a7931094a6b7b72a896a7c68e346b7f5,What are the full names of the three companies who settled out of court in 1981?,Libbey-Owens-Ford,I.

"While Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve themes of sex and love. One of the Boys is a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences. Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life. The singer's fifth studio effort Witness is an electropop album that she described as a ""360-degree liberation"" record, with themes including political liberation, sexual liberation, and liberation from negativity. Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on love between teenagers; W described the album's sexual innuendos as ""irresistible hook-laden melodies"". Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.Perry describes herself as a ""singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star"" and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told Marie Claire: ""I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable."" Kristen Wiig commented that ""as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record."" According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, ""being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet."" The New York Times labeled her ""the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation"". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent ""clichés"". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, and Nicki Minaj.",cf5535515e133deb30e646afd49a3107,What are the name of the other artists who have recorded songs co-written by Perry?,Selena Gomez & the Scene,"Scene,",bert,c9ea0308ebbd13228862673188102ae0,What are the name of the other artists who have recorded songs co-written by Perry?,Selena Gomez & the Scene,Selena,bert,ec8aed4434385860ed03bb0dd97588c5,What are the name of the other artists who have recorded songs co-written by Perry?,Selena Gomez & the Scene,Selena Gomez,bert,79f53f927b73796491352f8c7c541cd2,What are the name of the other artists who have recorded songs co-written by Perry?,Selena Gomez & the Scene,"Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea,",bert,b594317392eee6d73b8933f0de29e331,What is the name of the magazine that Perry told that you become more relatable when you're vulnerable?,Marie Claire,"Chicago Tribune, ""being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet.""

"While cleaning one of his father's rifles as a birthday surprise, young Ed Jr. accidentally shoots his mother. Ed never forgives his son for this, and the two become estranged. Years later, while Ed and his friends are trying to think of something to do for their college's fall break, Big Ed calls, and demands Ed come to his beachfront condominium, and close it up for the winter. Ed's friends convince him to accept the job, and take them with him, so it will be finished quicker, and they can spend the rest of their break hanging around the condo. Ed's group arrives at the condo, which Big Ed is passed out drunk in the basement of, having dreams about killing his son. After dinner, everyone goes for a walk on the beach, and Mike and Linda go skinny dipping in the pool. Big Ed discovers the two, drowns Linda, and uses a trail of her and Mike's discarded clothes to lure Mike back to the condo, where he kills him with an outboard motor. A police officer stationed on the beach then stops by the condo, and is killed when Big Ed decapitates him with an axe. The others return to the condo, and as his friends get ready for bed, Ralph searches for Mike and Linda, and is killed when Big Ed impales him through the throat with a pitchfork.

"While cleaning one of his father's rifles as a birthday surprise, young Ed Jr. accidentally shoots his mother. Ed never forgives his son for this, and the two become estranged. Years later, while Ed and his friends are trying to think of something to do for their college's fall break, Big Ed calls, and demands Ed come to his beachfront condominium, and close it up for the winter. Ed's friends convince him to accept the job, and take them with him, so it will be finished quicker, and they can spend the rest of their break hanging around the condo. Ed's group arrives at the condo, which Big Ed is passed out drunk in the basement of, having dreams about killing his son. After dinner, everyone goes for a walk on the beach, and Mike and Linda go skinny dipping in the pool. Big Ed discovers the two, drowns Linda, and uses a trail of her and Mike's discarded clothes to lure Mike back to the condo, where he kills him with an outboard motor. A police officer stationed on the beach then stops by the condo, and is killed when Big Ed decapitates him with an axe. The others return to the condo, and as his friends get ready for bed, Ralph searches for Mike and Linda, and is killed when Big Ed impales him through the throat with a pitchfork. When Ralph does not return, Sue goes looking for him, and is caught by Big Ed, who stabs her in the crotch with a fishing gaff, and chops her head off.

"Wild Combination begins with interviews of Russell's parents discussing their youngest offspring's childhood. The film describes how Russell as a young boy is obsessed with Timothy Leary and insecure about his acne. Leaving Iowa for San Francisco in the late sixties, he joins a Buddhist collective and befriends Allen Ginsberg. Russell decides to move to New York in the early seventies, where he starts working as the musical director of the Kitchen and becomes part of the downtown scene of artists, sharing an apartment building with Allen Ginsberg and Richard Hell. Russell engages in nearly every music scene the city has to offer: disco at David Mancuso's Loft, rock at CBGB, minimal composition at the Kitchen, and Allen Ginsberg's poetry recitations. In 1978, Russell begins dating Tom Lee, whom he stays with until his AIDS-related death in 1992. Other footage shows Russell later in life, ravaged by AIDS, but still able to play his cello and sing. Russell eventually succumbs to dementia and throat cancer. The film ends with Emily Russell, Arthur's mother, speculating that had Arthur continued to live past forty, ""He would have made it, he would have gone far"".",6c6182f89384013a142274741819590e,What is the musical focus of the place where Russell works as musical director?,minimal composition,Buddhist,bert,b60a1610feb298ff69a523239bef80e4,What is the musical focus of the place where Russell works as musical director?,minimal composition,Buddhist collective,bert,7d53e757d0c26f6485a5f2cd7fe3658a,What is the musical focus of the place where Russell works as musical director?,minimal composition,Kitchen,bert,2fe4d16a1ced9e4ad19e7d99ac1320b0,Who joins a Buddhist collective?,Russell,Russell's,bert,cf0e853aebda1693cd9eb48710bd7450,Who joins a Buddhist collective?,Russell,Russell's parents discussing their youngest offspring's childhood.

"William Etty was born in 1787, the son of a York baker and miller. He began as an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London ""with a few pieces of chalk crayons"", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters. He enrolled at the Royal Academy, and after a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. A follower of John Opie, who promoted the unfashionable painting style of Titian and Rubens over the then-prevalent formal style of Joshua Reynolds, Etty was unsuccessful in all the Academy's competitions and every work he submitted to the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in the 1810s was rejected. In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works in the Summer Exhibition, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). This painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received.",ab72fb3029f86d4f46c043f78de3dc77,What is the last name of the person who became well-respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting?,Etty,Etty's,bert,a78f4d64eecfbd436868dbe92130b394,What is the last name of the person who became well-respected for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones?,Etty,Etty's,bert,8034044319aab669f09651c6ef1ed2f6,What is the last name of the person who began as an apprentice printer in Hull?,Etty,Etty's,bert,1fc60ef837a986dad5f220f9890c5ddc,What is the last name of the person who completed his seven-year apprenticeship?,Etty,Etty's,bert,dd0423cb0377b84ae9c9a8cf952e16a7,What is the last name of the person who enrolled at the Royal Academy?,Etty,Etty's,bert,932e17820e1d79fa087d675d67a01d51,What is the last name of the person who moved to London at the age of 18?,Etty,Etty's,bert,c4b11923b47af95c3ca318cee1126936,What is the last name of the person who studied under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence?,Etty,Etty's,bert,af54621c3bc74d08636e79eb85a70049,What is the last name of the person who was admired by his fellow artists?,Etty,Etty's,bert,1bd97c58a691cc139f262c8374503270,What is the last name of the person whose intention was to become a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters?,Etty,Etty's,bert,113f651796bff80ee970c661aad351c5,What is the last name of the person whose repeated depictions of female nudity was condemned as indecent?,Etty,Etty's,bert,9f93803f05df901d30e5a45c4fa92568,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"With greater power and wealth during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC), Egypt devoted still more resources to its temples, which grew larger and more elaborate. Higher-ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions, and they controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth. Anthony Spalinger suggests that, as the influence of temples expanded, religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into the temples' increasingly important festival rituals. The most important god of the time was Amun, whose main cult center, the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak in Thebes, eventually became the largest of all temples, and whose high priests may have wielded considerable political influence.Many temples were now built entirely of stone, and their general plan became fixed, with the sanctuary, halls, courtyards, and pylon gateways oriented along the path used for festival processions. New Kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs a great distance from their mortuary temples. Without pyramids to build around, mortuary temples began using the same plan as those dedicated to the gods.In the middle of the New Kingdom, Pharaoh Akhenaten promoted the god Aten over all others and eventually abolished the official worship of most other gods. Traditional temples were neglected while new Aten temples, differing sharply in design and construction, were erected. But Akhenaten's revolution was reversed soon after his death, with the traditional cults reinstated and the new temples dismantled. Subsequent pharaohs dedicated still more resources to the temples, particularly Ramesses II, the most prolific monument-builder in Egyptian history. As the wealth of the priesthoods continued to grow, so did their religious influence: temple oracles, controlled by the priests, were an increasingly popular method of making decisions. Pharaonic power waned, and in the eleventh century BC a military leader, Herihor, made himself High Priest of Amun and the de facto ruler of Upper Egypt, beginning the political fragmentation of the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070–664 BC).As the New Kingdom crumbled, the building of mortuary temples ceased and was never revived. Some rulers of the Third Intermediate Period, such as those at Tanis, were buried within the enclosures of divine temples, thus continuing the close link between temple and tomb.",84c2f4f22b3e9c9f5f06910e5ee10b62,What controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth?,Higher-ranking priestly roles,Egypt,bert,a38d18c61435297c15243e4bcd31f47b,What controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth?,Higher-ranking priestly roles,priesthoods,bert,eeea3a904c26ae8dd3a001e629dfb093,What controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth?,Higher-ranking priestly roles,the priests,bert,1b342f96fa349bf4e775e12692561ba9,What is the full name of the person who died in the passage?,Pharaoh Akhenaten,Akhenaten,bert,99c34ad85414230207ee74a382c88474,What is the full name of the person who died in the passage?,Pharaoh Akhenaten,Akhenaten promoted the god Aten,bert,f31e2fc8f642d3bf3f6129e67fe161e0,What is the full name of the person who died in the passage?,Pharaoh Akhenaten,Aten,bert,40bb1cc6392d8355263b4c926500298f,What is the full name of the person who died in the passage?,Pharaoh Akhenaten,"Ramesses II,",bert,bb61585535de840cc26ca8c1bef6786f,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Woody is sifting through some travel magazines when he spots a tempting ad for the Swiss Chard Lodge. The lodge is situated in Idaho, and promises lots of good food waiting for its guests. Woody is ecstatic, and promptly books a train ticket. After disembarking at the train station at Sunstroke Valley, it becomes apparent that the lodge is still an additional 40 miles, with no adjacent roads or any form of transportation. Woody decides to take matters into his own hands by taking a short cut, skiing and singing his way through the mountains. A refrain of the song ""The Sleigh (à la Russe)"" (also ""Dark Eyes"" tune for few seconds) can be heard while he is ice-skating.Upon Woody's arrival, lodge owner Wally Walrus advises that there are no accommodations without a reservation. Woody, of course, did not bother to inquire about such a rule. Drawn by the aroma of the warm food inside the lodge, Woody gains entry by disguising himself as Santa Claus. Wally is so excited at the prospect of Kris Kringle arriving that he quickly adorns the lodge with Christmas decorations. It does not take long, though, for the skeptical walrus to discover that it is, in fact, only October, making Santa's arrival somewhat premature. Woody manages to stuff his Santa toy sack with food from the lodge, and starts singing and skiing his way down the mountain. However, upon opening the sack, Woody discovers a vengeful Wally Walrus who wrings the little woodpecker's neck in disgust and mocks Woody's ""ha-ha-ha-HA-ha"".",1284b34958e140cf3ce93af5fa27c19f,How does the woodpecker try to fool the walrus?,by disguising himself as Santa Claus,"""ha-ha-ha-HA-ha"".",bert,5ef5d4fcbf06eb59d68433296fd91410,How does the woodpecker try to fool the walrus?,by disguising himself as Santa Claus,Santa Claus.,bert,c2cae6679d435c1b781bdfa330970a15,How does the woodpecker try to fool the walrus?,by disguising himself as Santa Claus,"mocks Woody's ""ha-ha-ha-HA-ha"".",bert,7247b17ac9e777af0ead43371d6d8c79,How does the woodpecker try to fool the walrus?,by disguising himself as Santa Claus,wrings the little woodpecker's neck,bert,a26a4a5f79e95af5c133c5ac43a2b4e9,How does the woodpecker try to fool the walrus?,by disguising himself as Santa Claus,wrings the little woodpecker's neck in disgust,bert,f71d4e6dbf77819e62d698b28fb203bd,How does the woodpecker try to fool the walrus?,by disguising himself as Santa Claus,"wrings the little woodpecker's neck in disgust and mocks Woody's ""ha-ha-ha-HA-ha"".",bert,2d7280ff7a113ef9d73af7fc27e19574,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"World-famous opera singer Alice Alquist has just been murdered at her home, No.9 Thornton Square. The perpetrator left without the jewels he sought after being interrupted by Paula, Alice's fourteen-year-old niece.  Paula was raised by her aunt following her mother's death.  After Alice is murdered, Paula is sent to Italy to train to become an opera star herself. Years later, an adult Paula meets and marries Gregory Anton after a two-week-long whirlwind romance.  Paula returns to London on his insistence, where she knows no one, to live in the long-vacant London townhouse of her deceased aunt Alice. To help calm her anxieties, Gregory suggests they store all of Alice's furnishings in the attic. Before they do, Paula discovers a letter in an old book addressed to her aunt by a man named Sergius Bauer.  Gregory's reaction is violent.  However, he dismisses his outburst as one of frustration at the bad memories his bride is experiencing. After Alice's belongings are locked away in the attic, events take a turn for the bizarre. At the Tower of London, Paula loses an heirloom brooch that Gregory had given her, despite its having been stored safely in her handbag. A picture disappears from the walls of the house; and Gregory says that Paula took it, one of many instances of her removing and hiding it.  But Paula has no recollection of having done so. Paula also hears footsteps coming from  the sealed attic, and sees the gaslights dim and brighten for no apparent reason. Gregory suggests these are in her imagination.",cbe80515f1c05209e4184fe6fa89a1f6,What is the full name of the man that niece of the opera singer marries?,Gregory Anton,Alice Alquist,bert,3d3b165bae34b35bcb69c20247c374da,What is the full name of the man that niece of the opera singer marries?,Gregory Anton,Anton,bert,ee312a15cd6dffe517ed37402b57ef9a,What is the full name of the man that niece of the opera singer marries?,Gregory Anton,Gregory,bert,ce41b24962910e9a2ff8827b998977ed,What is the full name of the man that niece of the opera singer marries?,Gregory Anton,Sergius,bert,94ebe3ae9ff433ab1a2d78792f864703,What is the full name of the man that niece of the opera singer marries?,Gregory Anton,Sergius Bauer.,bert,495689098e85453a7b95338ff09c21c6,What is the full name of the person that the woman who's mother died finds a letter addressed to?,Alice Alquist,Alice.,bert,dc9dc07242512c7d311c5e9cd54ba590,What is the full name of the person that the woman who's mother died finds a letter addressed to?,Alice Alquist,Gregory Anton,bert,ac8bc06895c471d06ccafc0d35a50e35,What is the full name of the person that the woman who's mother died finds a letter addressed to?,Alice Alquist,"Paula,",bert,3075e9a89cbd964b47262a0a7ea096d7,What is the full name of the person that the woman who's mother died finds a letter addressed to?,Alice Alquist,Sergius Bauer.,bert,060147a6be84688ca43c332ce88fd63e,What is the full name of the person who raised Paula?,Alice Alquist,"Alice Alquist has just been murdered at her home, No.9 Thornton Square.",bert,2d9e534af83862c222c0b88c8d192621,What is the full name of the person who raised Paula?,Alice Alquist,Anton,bert,988df3cfb58e08060dfaedc5cdc4550c,What is the full name of the person who raised Paula?,Alice Alquist,Gregory,bert,9f1a5a776e26d283c0987028f52f9625,What is the full name of the person who raised Paula?,Alice Alquist,Gregory Anton,bert,ad6731303ab3cbe244be1ded98748351,What is the full name of the person who raised Paula?,Alice Alquist,Sergius Bauer.,bert,a0fd61130d9fcbc104e936c58d9002a3,Who is the man that has a violent outburst married to?,Paula,Alice.,bert,4d76f702ee16d5ba9be43a169f1158bf,Who is the man that has a violent outburst married to?,Paula,"Alice.

"Wormshill includes two farms: Yew Tree Farm (dairy farming) at the south end of the village, and Norwood Farm (fruit and other crops) at the north end. A third farm, Home Farm appeared on late 19th and early 20th centuries Ordnance Survey maps in the centre of the village. This farm is no longer in use, but some outbuildings remain. Wormshill at one time included a blacksmith's shop, which is recorded on Ordnance Survey maps until 1898.  According to the 1831 Census, 40 of the 48 adult males in the village were employed in the agricultural sector. Census records from the mid-to-late 19th century show a marked increase in the construction of new homes, representing the largest growth in the village for the next 100 years; however, the 1901 Census still described the majority of workers as ""labourers and servants"". The population spike between 1821 and 1901 is a trend typical to the general growth in the need for physical labour from parishes in the Kent downland agricultural region in the 19th century which was followed in the early 20th century by the increasing mechanisation of farming activity. Although the farms continue to employ from the village, as of 2008 Wormshill is largely a dormitory village, with residents employed in nearby towns or commuting to London. The socio-economic classification of Census 2001 indicated that the most common occupations were ""lower managerial and professional occupations"" (21.9 percent) and ""small employers and own account workers"" (15.2 percent).",f59cc72c447b218272522d9e9e2a39e3,"What is the name of the farm where some buildings still exist, despite being closed?",Home Farm,Norwood Farm,bert,d888842ad96e82a7f4b26e07bba3240d,"What is the name of the farm where some buildings still exist, despite being closed?",Home Farm,"Norwood Farm (fruit and other crops) at the north end.

"Young Judy Bellaire has trouble fitting in at school, causing trouble by introducing her jazzy style into music class and being expelled as a result.  Returning home to her dysfunctional and financially challenged family, where her playwright father, actress mother, and beautiful elder sister, Sylvia compete for attention along with the funny Russian maid, Olga and the hunky cook, Ricky, who is not-so-secretly in love with Sylvia.

"Zohan Dvir is a superhuman Israeli counter-terrorist for the IDF who has grown tired of the everlasting conflicts in his country and dreams of becoming a hairstylist at Paul Mitchell's. During his next mission against an Palestinian terrorist group led by his arch-enemy, superhuman Fatoush ""Phantom"" Hakbarah, Zohan fakes his own death and smuggles himself onto a plane to New York City, cuts his hair, and adopts the alias ""Scrappy Coco"". Following his ""success"" at killing Zohan, Phantom opens a muchentuchen restaurant chain. After his arrival in America, Zohan befriends Michael by helping him against a bullying motorist, and is taken in by him and his mother, Gail. He also meets a fellow Israeli named Oori, who owns an electronics store, at a disco; Oori recognizes Zohan but vows to keep his identity a secret. After being refused by Paul Mitchell's and other hairstyling salons due to his lack of experience, Zohan is taken by Oori to an area in lower Manhattan populated with Middle Eastern immigrants, including Palestinians and Israelis. Zohan attempts to land a job in a struggling salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia. Dalia initially allows Zohan to sweep the floors, but after losing one of her employees, she allows him to be a stylist when he pleases a senior lady with an exceptional haircut and back room sexual service. Zohan's reputation spreads rapidly among the elderly women of lower Manhattan, causing Dalia's business to prosper, which upsets Grant Walbridge, a corporate magnate who has been trying to buy out all the local tenants on the block so that he can build a rollercoaster mall.",b3832a400d833d21f2922326fbbed91c,What is the first name of the person that loses an employee?,Dalia,Dalia initially allows Zohan,bert,124be3407b73d7c30b06ef9448461acb,What is the first name of the person that loses an employee?,Dalia,Dalia.
