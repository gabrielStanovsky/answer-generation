"1951 - Having already killed OCD patient Billy Brown at the Redding House Asylum, a psychiatrist experiments on simple-minded inmate Melvin Veman and sociopath Levius Laitura.

"1974, the present. Dorothy Yates lives with her husband Edmund in an isolated farmhouse in Haslemere, Surrey. They have just been released from a mental institution to which they were committed in 1957 after it was found Dorothy was a cannibal who killed and partially ate at least six people. It is later revealed that her cannibalism can be understood as an attempt to cope with a childhood trauma when she found out that she had eaten parts of her pet rabbit that her parents had cooked and served as dinner. Although her husband Edmund was convicted, it is later revealed that he only faked his dementia in order to remain with his wife. He is a truly devoted husband who loves his wife dearly and does not take part in the actual acts of murder in 1957 and in the present, only helping in covering them up. Now, it seems as if Dorothy has had a severe relapse. She secretly lures lonely young people to her home, promising tea and a tarot card reading, only with the sessions ending with a violent murder and ""feast"".   Jackie, Edmund's daughter by previous marriage, lives in London but secretely visits her dad and stepmum at night to bring her parcels containing animal brain, thereby implicitly feigning to commit murders for her so as to contain Dorothy's murderous urges. At the same time, Jackie tries to control her 15-year-old stepsister Debbie, Dorothy's actual daughter that she and Edmund had shortly before being committed to the asylum. Debbie has been recently thrown out of the orphanage. She now stays with Jackie and rides with her boyfriend Alec, head of a violent biker gang. Debbie incites Alec to start a fight with a barman in one of London's hip nightclubs because he denied her liquor due to her being underage. When they get thrown out, the bike gang later ambush and assault the barman with a chain but leave when spotted. Debbie, however, decides to stay behind and hides the body in the trunk of a car before the police arrive.",2df7dd191f9cf9f09c38e3bc99a34ac1,Who is the boyfriend of Dorothy's actual daughter?,Alec,"Alec, head of a violent biker gang.

"1986 — Thomás is born with his eyes closed, and he does not open them for several weeks following the birth. Julieta, his mother, is unconcerned, believing that when Thomás is ready and wants to open his eyes, he will. These events instill a strong belief in free will in young Thomás. Two weeks after his birth, Thomás opens his eyes, apparently to look directly at his five-year-old half-brother Francisco. 1992 — Julieta is a wife and a loving mother, working in a hospital emergency department. Her free-spirited youngest son, Thomás, is the product of her marriage to her second husband Alexandre. Pedro, her first husband and father of her eldest son Francisco, lives in Argentina. Pedro and Julieta remain good friends. During childhood, Francisco and Thomás are very close, perhaps too close according to Pedro, with whom they spend a Christmas holiday in Buenos Aires. Julieta is aware of their close relationship and tries to remain understanding. Not long later, Pedro dies. 2008 — Years later, when Francisco is 27 and Thomás 22, Julieta dies. The brothers become lovers and an unusual love story ensues. Thomás is invited to live and train in Russia for a few years in preparation for the Olympics. Though it is the first time they will be apart, Thomás leaves. Francisco struggles without Thomás. He meets a woman in a club and though he tries to pursue a relationship with her, they both realize he is dedicated to someone else.

"3 of Hearts' vocals and image received praise from music critics following the album's release. Billboard described the trio as ""possess[ing] angelic voices"" and praised 3 of Hearts as ""ear candy"". D Magazine said the album's pop composition could allow the group to have a crossover appeal, and compared them to the Dixie Chicks. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album as well-constructed and appealing, but criticized several songs – specifically ""Over the Edge"" – as sounding dated. He positively compared the trio's vocals to those of American band Rascal Flatts, and preferred their wholesome image over the more sexualized one attached to American singer Willa Ford.

"4 is the fourth solo studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was released on June 24, 2011 by Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. Following a career hiatus that reignited her creativity, Beyoncé was inspired to create a record with a basis in traditional rhythm and blues that stood apart from contemporary popular music. Her collaborations with songwriters and record producers The-Dream, Tricky Stewart and Shea Taylor produced a mellower tone, developing diverse vocal styles and influences from funk, hip hop, and soul music. Severing professional ties with father and manager Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé eschewed the music of her previous releases in favor of an intimate, personal album. 4's lyrics emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé considering a maturer message to contend artistic credibility. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs to Columbia Records for consideration, twelve of which appeared on the standard edition. 4 was promoted in mid-2011 by television performances and festival appearances, such as Beyoncé's headlining Glastonbury Festival set. The album received generally positive reviews by music critics; several publications included it on their year-end lists. It was her fourth consecutive album to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200, and it also reached number one in Brazil, France, Ireland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 4 spawned the international singles ""Run the World (Girls)"", ""Best Thing I Never Had"", ""Party"", ""Love on Top"" and ""Countdown"".

"4 received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 36 reviews. Michael Cragg of The Observer called it Beyoncé's ""most accomplished album yet"". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson believed 4 succeeds vocally as an album of mostly intimate and slow-tempo ballads. Mikael Wood of Spin magazine applauded its ballads, mid-tempo songs, and evocations of late 1970s and early 1980s pop-soul. In his review for Rolling Stone, Jody Rosen wrote that Beyoncé eschews contemporary production styles for a more personal and idiosyncratic album. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times viewed it as a good showcase for Beyoncé as a torch singer, because she convincingly sings about heartbreak and the strong emotional effect of love. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal found it easygoing, retro-informed, and engaging because it shows ""one of the world's biggest stars exploring her talent in ways few could've predicted"". AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that the quality of Beyoncé's singing and the songwriting compensate for the assorted arrangement of the songs. Uncut viewed it is an exceptional album in spite of occasionally trite lyrics.In a less enthusiastic review, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly said the first half of 4 is marred by boring ballads and the songwriting in general are not on-par with Beyoncé's vocal talent.

"A Boston Globe article attributed Barack Obama's win in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election to a marked reduction over the preceding decades in the percentage of whites in the American electorate, attributing this demographic change to the Immigration Act of 1965. The article quoted Simon Rosenberg, president and founder of the New Democrat Network, as having said that the Act is ""the most important piece of legislation that no one's ever heard of,"" and that it ""set America on a very different demographic course than the previous 300 years.""Immigrants differ on their political views; however, the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position among immigrants overall. Research shows that religious affiliation can also significantly impact both their social values and voting patterns of immigrants, as well as the broader American population.

"A Drax Industries Moonraker space shuttle on loan to the United Kingdom is hijacked in midair. M, head of MI6, assigns James Bond, Agent 007, to investigate. En route to England, Bond is attacked by the Apollo jet crew and pushed out of the plane by the mercenary assassin Jaws. He survives by stealing a parachute from the pilot, whilst Jaws lands on a trapeze net within a circus tent. At the Drax Industries shuttle-manufacturing complex in California, Bond meets the owner of the company, Hugo Drax, and his henchman Chang. Bond also meets Dr. Holly Goodhead, an astronaut, and he then survives an assassination attempt while inside a centrifuge chamber. Drax's personal pilot, Corinne Dufour, helps Bond find blueprints for a glass vial made in Venice; Drax discovers her involvement and has her killed by his pet dogs.  Bond again encounters Goodhead in Venice and observes her snooping around a door near the glass factory. Then he is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He returns to the factory at night to check the door out, and discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Chang attacks Bond, but Bond hurls him through the stained glass clockface of the Saint Mark's clocktower, killing him; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces that she is a CIA agent spying on Drax.

"A group of teenagers verging on adulthood are to spend a year in a remote village in Indonesia, learning to live on the same terms as the people in that village. Their teacher is going along as well, but he decides to make a little extra money along the way: he cancels out on their scheduled transport to the village's nearest airport and hires a decrepit plane and its pilot, who's seen better days for his income. The deal is that the pilot will make out the receipt for a higher amount than the teacher actually pays. The pilot, in turn, makes a deal with drug dealers to make a delivery, so when the plane takes off with the students aboard and the teacher in the co-pilot's seat, it isn't flying the direction the teacher and the students require to get to their destination. The plane has mechanical troubles, and lands in the water near an island while the pilot checks it out. He informs the teacher that he'll have to return to an airport for repairs, and teacher says he's going along to make sure the pilot returns. That leaves the students on the island. While they wait, some of them explore, but one dies in the rising tide after a rock traps his foot against another rock. As night approaches, they decide to leave the beach and find a better campsite. They leave a note for the pilot and teacher that they'll listen for the plane. Meanwhile, the plane is having even more mechanical problems, as the pilot gives a grim comment to the teacher. Many of them quickly discover they need a leader to make decisions and serve as arbiter in disagreements. Having accepted one boy, they then decide on some rules, such as lavatory rules. Some days later, the airplane is spotted next to the shore of the island. The leader leads them cross-country to the plane to check it out, and he briefly gets caught in quicksand and panics, but is extricated without threat to his life, although a passing snake rubbing behind him freaks him out.",4b64879f91223ce645658d8a73bb89c9,Who mentions that he has to fly the plane to the airport for repairs?,the pilot,teacher,bert,3d58e74d5f3ff92b339ff68b8babf2b4,What is the position of the person that gets caught in quicksand?,The leader,pilot,bert,e6db36a617de7d5f68d54c7463b39e36,What is the position of the person that gets freaked out by a snake?,The leader,"pilot, who's seen better days for his income.

"A group of young vigilantes seeking revenge for a sexual betrayal fall far from grace. When the truth is out, they find themselves on the dark side of justice.  It becomes a case study in how people handle themselves in a situation that goes awry. It's an essay in the consequences of ill-considered actions and how people manage themselves in a space they're entirely ill-equipped to handle.  Music teacher Bernard is attacked at his home in isolated bushland by five young people masked and dressed in black. The group have just attended the funeral of Cate's (Kestie Morassi) sister Alice, and they've come to kill Bernard, whom they blame for the girl's death as he had an affair with her when she was sixteen, and now, three years later she's taken her own life. Alice's boyfriend, Nick, is the lead agitator; Alice's best friend, Natalie, has persuaded her boyfriend, Anthony, to steal sleeping pills from his father's doctors surgery to make it look as though Bernard has committed suicide. It all however goes horribly wrong when their attempt fails and their victim fights for his life. In the aftermath, questions are raised about the true nature of the events leading up to the botched attack.

"A poacher hides from an unknown creature in his boat. While it breaks through the boat and attempts to catch the poacher, he commits suicide by shooting himself dead to prevent the beast from killing him. Meanwhile while shooting a documentary about a long-lost indigenous tribe, the Shirishamas, on the Amazon River, director Terri Flores and members of her crew including cameraman Danny Rich, production manager Denise Kalberg, her boyfriend, sound engineer Gary Dixon, visionary Warren Westridge, anthropologist Professor Steven Cale, and boat skipper Mateo come across stranded Paraguayan snake hunter Paul Serone and help him, believing he knows how to find the tribe they are searching for. Most of the crew are uncomfortable around Serone, and Cale clashes with him several times in regards to Shirishama lore.

"A poacher hides from an unknown creature in his boat. While it breaks through the boat and attempts to catch the poacher, he commits suicide by shooting himself dead to prevent the beast from killing him. Meanwhile while shooting a documentary about a long-lost indigenous tribe, the Shirishamas, on the Amazon River, director Terri Flores and members of her crew including cameraman Danny Rich, production manager Denise Kalberg, her boyfriend, sound engineer Gary Dixon, visionary Warren Westridge, anthropologist Professor Steven Cale, and boat skipper Mateo come across stranded Paraguayan snake hunter Paul Serone and help him, believing he knows how to find the tribe they are searching for. Most of the crew are uncomfortable around Serone, and Cale clashes with him several times in regards to Shirishama lore.

"A recently widowed Englishwoman, Mary Panton, is staying at the villa of some wealthy friends outside of Florence, Italy in 1938. After meeting her old friend Sir Edgar Swift at a party celebrating the Munich Agreement, she is surprised when he proposes marriage to her the next day. She asks for a few days to think the proposal over, and he agrees to meet with her on his return from Rome. That evening, at a party hosted by her friend, the Princess San Ferdinando, she meets a married American man named Rowley Flint, who has a reputation for being a rogue. A violinist arrives to entertain the guests but is so terrible that the Princess has him removed. Out of sympathy Mary leaves him a large tip.

"A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal. His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome. His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style"", prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility. By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in Histoires naturelles. The same technique is highlighted in Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided. In the cycles Shéhérazade and Chansons madécasses, Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment.Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques, Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires. Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue, Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine. For three songs dating from 1914–15, he wrote his own texts.Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.",4f1aec26e392cfdd90218699a0f0e2e3,"Whose vocal music did Kelly describe as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style""?",Ravel,Ravel's,bert,db0afd8467cf5d05936749dda6c05be5,What is the name of the person whose word-setting is noticeably more formal than Ravel's?,Debussy,"Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel,",bert,8082e7d68a249fd90c2cc26cf14e3586,Whose word-setting is noticeably more formal?,Debussy,Ravel's,bert,6e6cbf374963fd5584981a82134d1598,"What is the name of the person whose early vocal music from the Prix de Rome period is described by Kelly as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style,"" with prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility?",Ravel,Ravel's,bert,c7b77b530c18318182fd31475ad6188d,"Whose vocal music did Kelly describe as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style""?",Ravel,Debussy's,bert,228776a88e80c7807744787550094c16,Whose word-setting is noticeably more formal?,Debussy,Ravel,bert,db164e735670d2a7ab6ef260c6708bcf,"What is the name of the person who drew upon the lyrics of poets that included Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue, Leconte de Lisle, and Verlaine?",Ravel,Ravel's,bert,1c2fc8fc6e2db72f0d25da535e5d6a48,"What is the name of the person whose early vocal music from the Prix de Rome period is described by Kelly as ""a static, recitative-like vocal style,"" with prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility?",Ravel,Debussy's,bert,a1741aa17cb9fb51fba0384343d5edad,What is the name of the person whose word-setting is noticeably more formal than Ravel's?,Debussy,Ravel,bert,9d0c4a923a8b3bc0818cb87d95f718e7,Whose word-setting is noticeably more formal?,Debussy,"Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel,",bert,85c6fc290b011593d005d4d9c636e6d7
"A tree comes down in a forest and several lumberjacks hack away at it with their axes. To the side, two lumberjacks, one a muscular man, the other one rather scrawny, chop at a tree, but only the larger man makes any progress. The skinny fellow prances off to a tiny sapling and with some effort chops it down, only to end up with pieces of it stuck to his head. The pieces resemble antlers. The lumber men have several inventive methods for chopping trees: one, involving a tractor-like vehicle with a large saw protruding from its side, leads to the felling of a guard tower in the forest! The scene switches to Buddy, who, upon chopping a tree with his axe, sends such a shake upwards that a mother and father bird are forced to remove their nest and babies from the tree top and carry the nest elsewhere. Some time obviously passes, for in the next scene, Buddy has already succeeded in felling the trunk. Merrily whistling away, Our Hero next gently glides a lawnmower-like device across a fallen trunk, in the process creating many toothpicks, which he then dumps into a truck, yelling to the driver: ""Take it away!"" Using a saw as though it were a jump rope, Buddy cuts a standing tree into several smaller pieces. Buddy so goads a goat that the creature chases him. The goat's horns cut through the suspended logs atop which Buddy runs from the pursuing creature. Eventually, the goat rams headfirst into a tree, and gets incapacitated. Buddy then carries an armful of small logs, but drops them, upon tripping, just perfectly that they are arranged across a wooden stand as a xylophone, which Buddy then plays by means of two axes: a totem pole comes to life and dances for the lumberjacks. The hard-working men are called to supper: enthusiastically, they wash up. A song before the meal: ""I Open the Old Northwest"", with Buddy at the piano. Cookie serves the men their spaghetti.",a7729308090aacb188f045ea369661cc,Who has a nest with babies in the tree that is chopped with an axe?,mother and father bird,"Buddy, who, upon chopping a tree with his axe, sends such a shake upwards that a mother",bert,191bf777605f9deba97d8242cd3737b9,What type of creature chases Buddy?,a goat,"goat that the creature chases him.

"Above the pylon, separated by the cornice, are the three Virtues—from left to right, Faith, Charity, and Hope—in shell niches, separated by four Corinthian fluted pilasters. Such a motif is unprecedented in Tuscan funerary sculpture but found at this date in Venice, Padua, and especially Cossa's native Naples. As a result, excursions to Venice have been suggested for both Michelozzo and Donatello. However, Janson suggests that one ""need not go all the way to Venice"" to find such motifs. Outside Florence, Virtues were common on tombs, with the cardinal Virtues used for laymen, and the theological virtues reserved for ecclesiastics, including the Brancaccio tomb. However, the Cossa Virtues, from their hair to their sandals, are more thoroughly antique. Donatello also produced two similar bronze Virtues for the Siena Baptistry, whose chronological relationship to the Cossa Virtues is unclear.The 1.05-metre (3.44 ft) tall Faith, to the right of Charity, is holding a Eucharistic chalice; the 1.07-metre (3.51 ft) tall Charity is holding a cornucopia and a brazier (or flaming vase); and the 1.06-metre (3.48 ft) tall Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer. The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of Abundantia, Ceres, and Juno, all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands. Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose of the tall yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing the peculiarities of Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the ""immediacy"" of the trope of lying in state, which was otherwise dominant on Quattrocento wall tombs.",d8fde6b81008253b69b46957671edb93,Which virtue is holding a Eucharistic chalice?,Faith,"unclear.The 1.05-metre (3.44 ft) tall Faith, to the right of Charity,",bert,e67b3d9baedd5f4a45fc79e35579af9e,What is featured on the Brancaccio tomb?,theological virtues,"Charity,",bert,26cbd83a7c5660305c9ffbd4676d015d,What is featured on the Brancaccio tomb?,theological virtues,cornucopias,bert,9525eccdb89460c4933e68de6be335bb,What is featured on the Brancaccio tomb?,theological virtues,Virtues,bert,1c261d33bda9191480841da338d6a411,What is featured on the Brancaccio tomb?,theological virtues,"Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer.

"After ""Jingle Bells"" melody, played on a calliope, is heard during the brief opening credits, two children, who appear to be five or six years old, are seen in a bunk bed, saying goodnight to their mother. The boy, Dick, is in the upper bunk and the girl, Ann, who is in the lower bunk, says, ""oh, Dick, I wonder if Santa ever got our letter"".  The visuals become blurry and a male narrator states, ""yes, Ann, far up in the North Pole, Santa is reading your letter now"". In a spacious living room setting, seated in a large easy chair and dressed in full traditional apparel, Santa is holding a sheet of paper which is shown in close-up to depict, in large-lettered children's handwriting, ""Dear Santa / DicK and I would LiKe To visiT You. / CouLD we PLEase visit you at The NoRTH PoLE beFore CHriSTmAs ? / DicK And ANN"". Upon reading the letter, Santa says, ""Why not"" and calls elf Toby to prepare the magic helicopter and bring the two children to him. Toby responds, ""your'all words are my command, Santa"". Appearing in Dick and Ann's bedroom, Toby awakens them with the words, ""hurry up and get dressed and we will fly to Santa"", as the narrator explains to the audience, ""it's just a short hop in the magic helicopter"".  Walking through a castle-style entrance inscribed ""Santa"", Toby leads Dick and Ann into Santa's living room and is then dismissed by Santa who, still seated in his large easy chair, takes the children onto his lap, as documentary footage of seasonal celebrations and Santa pageantry appears on the screen, with the narrator recounting how Christmas is observed in various cities and towns. A Christmas parade, with main focus on Santa, is seen in the Pennsylvania city of McKeesport. Santa gives Dick and Ann a tour of ""The Village Toy Shop"" which appears as a series of Christmas doll and toy exhibits as well as displays in a large department store.

"After causing yet another scandal, Kay Dowling, the spoiled daughter of wealthy New Yorkers, is given a stark choice by her fed-up father, go to his ranch in Ursula, Wyoming, (to avoid being named a co-respondent in a divorce case) or be disinherited. Kay's fiance, Herbert Forrest, proposes getting married immediately, but she chooses the ranch.  Later, while spending her days on the ranch with her good-humored aunt Bessie, Kay falls reluctantly in love with one of her father's cowhands, Tom McNair, and impulsively marries him. When her father learns of the union, he disowns her. Kay and Tom are forced to live in a one-room shack while Tom tries to expand his cattle herd. One year later, Kay is unhappy with life on the ranch, and longs for the comforts of her family's palatial mansion. One day, she receives a telegram from home, and tells Tom that her father is sick and that she must be with him. Back in New York, Kay writes a letter to Tom, asking for a divorce. Soon after, Tom arrives at the estate and explains that he left the ranch to become a professional bronco rider in a rodeo. Kay assumes that he never received the letter, and Tom never mentions it. One night during a party, Tom overhears the guests making fun of him and he tells Kay she can have her divorce. Later, as she realizes that life with Herbert would amount to a life of playing golf, Kay visits Tom at the rodeo. During his performance, he is thrown from a bronco and hurt.

"After graduating from Pacific Night Law School in Los Angeles, feisty and ambitious Mexican American Johnny Ramirez loses his first court case because he is ill-prepared. His poor, Hispanic client's truck was destroyed by careless debutante Dale Elwell. Johnny is harassed by the opposing attorney, uppercrust Brook Manville, who is defending his lover, Elwell. Johnny reacts, losing his temper and the case. Disbarred for his actions, he journeys to a small town south of the border and finds work as a bouncer, in a seedy casino owned by Charlie Roark. Johnny helps transform the dive into a first-class nightclub called the Silver Slipper that attracts an upscale crowd, and Charlie makes him a partner to reward him for his efforts. Charlie's lonely, unhappily married wife Marie makes a play for Johnny, who resists her advances. Certain Johnny has shunned her simply because she is married, she locks her inebriated husband in the garage and leaves the car running, asphyxiating him. Dale Elwell and her society friends, including Brook Manville, visit the club and Johnny becomes infatuated with her. A jealous Marie accuses Johnny of murdering Charlie, but when called to testify at his trial, she collapses on the witness stand, having become insane.

"After his share in the Farthest South achievement of the Discovery Expedition, Ernest Shackleton suffered a physical collapse on the return journey, and was sent home with the expedition's relief vessel on orders from Scott; he bitterly resented it, and the two became rivals.  Four years later, Shackleton organised his own polar venture, the Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09. This was the first expedition to set the definite objective of reaching the South Pole, and to have a specific strategy for doing so.To assist his endeavour, Shackleton adopted a mixed transport strategy, involving the use of Manchurian ponies as pack animals, as well as the more traditional dog-sledges. A specially adapted motor car was also taken. Although the dogs and the car were used during the expedition for a number of purposes, the task of assisting the group that would undertake the march to the pole fell to the ponies. The size of Shackleton's four-man polar party was dictated by the number of surviving ponies; of the ten that were embarked in New Zealand, only four had survived the 1908 winter.Ernest Shackleton and three companions (Frank Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Adams) began their march on 29 October 1908. On 26 November they surpassed the farthest point reached by Scott's 1902 party. ""A day to remember"", wrote Shackleton in his journal, noting that they had reached this point in far less time than on the previous march with Captain Scott. Shackleton's group continued southward, discovering and ascending the Beardmore Glacier to the polar plateau, and then marching on to reach their Farthest South point at 88°23'S, a mere 97 nautical miles (180 km; 112 mi) from the pole, on 9 January 1909. Here they planted the Union Jack presented to them by Queen Alexandra, and took possession of the plateau in the name of King Edward VII, before shortages of food and supplies forced them to turn back north. This was, at the time, the closest convergence on either pole. The increase of more than six degrees south from Scott's previous record was the greatest extension of Farthest South since Captain Cook's 1773 mark. Shackleton was treated as a hero on his return to England. His record was to stand for less than three years, being passed by Amundsen on 7 December 1911.",4c2c56a71370fe346550ab2472b5e194,What is the first name of the person who adopted a mixed transport strategy?,Ernest,"Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09.",bert,5f317948392f069ff5ea1f9f55bf21ba,What is the last name of the person who broke Ernest's record?,Amundsen,Scott;,bert,9ca72c0fccb0ae2d41dd9f7de4c47a0d,What is the first name of the person who set up the first expedition to set the definite objective of reaching the South Pole?,Ernest,"Nimrod Expedition,",bert,0edc64f61bf475e30f494e36bac5fe09,What is the first name of the person who adopted a mixed transport strategy?,Ernest,"the Nimrod Expedition,",bert,ae8f53f9f292c4ded0ac16664ab0857f,What is the first name of the person whose record was to stand for less than three years?,Ernest,winter.Ernest Shackleton and three companions (Frank,bert,b6787fd9542e47c893f5eeb75e3bf73b,What were the last names of the two people who became rivals?,Scott,Ernest Shackleton,bert,1655de7905a19d526fc7bc336e67df4b,What were the last names of the two people who became rivals?,Scott,Shackleton,bert,16c1ded5e0e3ef63e417569525877364,What is the first name of the person whose record was to stand for less than three years?,Ernest,(Frank,bert,8b85446db46c19b80a89d7d06040139e,What is the first name of the person who adopted a mixed transport strategy?,Ernest,winter.Ernest,bert,8c91f512407e2d364a369f8c455e901f,What is the last name of the person who broke Ernest's record?,Amundsen,Shackleton,bert,1ece8dc79fec054a605b070ce6ccbf49

"After their HIV positive mother's death, Derick and Margaret collect wood and construct a human-length box with wheels. Then, they journey with it from Kampala to Kasangombe in a heartbreaking bid to overcome poverty and experience hope. The journey throws them dangerous experiences on unpredictable Ugandan roads. Their mother's dying wish had set them off on a seemingly impossible journey to find a relative they do not even know. Before her death, she leaves them an envelope addressed to her sister (their auntie) who is married to a hard-working man living in a distant village called Kasangombe with their kids. Ingeniously, Derick creates a coffin using wood he collected from a rubbish dump and adds luggage bag rollers brought by Margaret. On their journey from Kampala City to their aunt's place, they are offered a lift by a seemingly kind man (played by Joel Okuyo Atiku) in a truck who is amazed by their ""box"". He introduces them to a kid he had taken under his wings relaxing at the back and shows them a photo of a house they can possess if they work for him. At night though, Margaret sees a scary dream where their helper is not exactly as kind as he seemed so she runs out of the truck. Derick follows and the boy throws out their coffin before waving. They walk the rest of the distance. Initially, their uncle (played by Isaac Muwawu) did not want them in his house because he thought they were HIV-infected.

"Alex Gates is a wine merchant living in Miami who has distanced himself from his alcoholic wife Suzanne with his philandering, and from his stepson Jason with his indifference. Alex is heavily in debt, and hatches a plan to steal a valuable diamond necklace from the house of his clients, the Reese family, where his Cuban mistress Gabriela works. He cases the house during a wine delivery with Jason, who works in Alex's business, although not happily. Jason becomes attracted to Gabriela, unaware of her relationship with his father. On the day of the heist, Alex and his British safe-cracker partner Victor arrive at the house under the pretense that the Reeses' wine cellar needs repairs, otherwise their wine will be ruined. Gabriela was supposed to let them in, but she was fired the day before. Fortunately, Alex had cultivated a relationship with the security guard and is able to convince him to admit them. Victor sends Alex and the guard off on an errand while he works on the safe, but a second guard becomes suspicious, although Victor is able to complete the job before being discovered. The pair decide that Alex will pawn the necklace in New York City, and he invites Gabriela to go with him. As he is packing, Suzanne chances upon the airline tickets for him and Gabriela and immediately realizes he is having another affair. The two of them get into a physical alteration and she knocks him out. Deciding to leave him, she empties out his suitcase, where he has hidden the necklace, and uses it for her own clothes. Jason walks in and the two of them flee to the Florida Keys. Upon arriving, they discover the necklace, but Suzanne doesn't want to keep it, even after Jason has it appraised, discovering it is worth $1 million. Jason also visits Gabriela back in Miami, giving her the phone number of the place they are staying at.",79ec0b725a1cefc40e08d45e07601f96,What are the first names of the people Gabriela was to let in?,Alex,Alex Gates is a wine merchant living in Miami who has distanced himself from his alcoholic wife Suzanne,bert,c89e47f37ef4ff8d1baca2759a43e73c,What are the first names of the people Gabriela was to let in?,Alex,"Jason becomes attracted to Gabriela, unaware of her relationship with his father.

"Almost immediately, the signal began to be misquoted. A number of ships in the fleet recorded the signal as ""England expects every man to do his duty"" (omitting that and replacing will with to). This version became so prevalent that it is recorded on Nelson's tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral. The word that is also omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column, as seen in the photo above. However, the Victory's log and the accounts of signal officer John Pasco and Henry Blackwood (captain of the frigate Euryalus), both present at the preparation of the signal, agree on the form given here. On 26 December 1805, The Times newspaper in London reported the signal as; ""England expects every officer and man to do his duty this day"". In 1811, the tenor John Braham composed a song, ""The Death of Nelson"", including the words of the signal. The song became popular almost immediately and was performed throughout the British Empire during the 19th century. To make the words fit the metre, they were altered to ""England expects that every man this day will do his duty"". This version of the wording is also persistent.Between 1885 and 1908 it was believed that the signal had been sent using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 it was pointed out that this had not been replaced until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags. The signal is still hoisted on the Victory at her dry dock in Portsmouth on Trafalgar Day (21 October) every year, although the signal flags are displayed all at once, running from fore to aft, rather than hoisted sequentially from the mizzenmast.",8429ff39a6f26f57149b99217ea39cec,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"""England expects every man to do his duty""",bert,fb360b28a2efe360887558cfb5102d24,What are the full names of the two people who agree to the form of the signal where that was omitted and will was replaced with to?,John Pasco,the Victory's log,bert,ba29862d4c44d087448434b08b78de91,What are the full names of the two people who agree to the form of the signal where that was omitted and will was replaced with to?,John Pasco,John Pasco and Henry Blackwood,bert,f0d45bd5d08a8018baddc463abec82ac,What are the full names of the two people who agree to the form of the signal where that was omitted and will was replaced with to?,John Pasco,the accounts of signal officer John Pasco,bert,328495a1bba548ee949e101c5d00d00e,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"""England expects every man to do his duty"" (omitting that",bert,6889beed4a4cad1d6146cbdfdc745a95,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"""England expects every man to do his duty"" (omitting that and replacing will with to).",bert,65a42dc5be7b018685fbfd933692aaab,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"""",bert,121813db7174d2794ab125bff31560cf,What are the full names of the two people who agree to the form of the signal where that was omitted and will was replaced with to?,John Pasco,the Victory's log and the accounts of signal officer John Pasco,bert,f2376bdef4bea476bedb263805c4d680,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,"the signal as ""England expects every man to do his duty""",bert,9443e6e303ef56fc56a45b2ef82087c8,What word is omitted on the version around the base of Nelson's Column?,that,will with to,bert,df4550e8e42a0576579599dfe32f8781
"American sailor David Martens, on shore leave in England, visits his brother Jack's grave. He meets fashion designer Sally Meadows, who by coincidence works with Jack's ex-fiancée, Diana, a model.

"An Army-OSRD council on 25 June 1942 decided to build a pilot plant for plutonium production in Red Gate Woods southwest of Chicago. In July, Nichols arranged for a lease of 1,025 acres (415 ha) from the Cook County Forest Preserve District, and Captain James F. Grafton was appointed Chicago area engineer. It soon became apparent that the scale of operations was too great for the area, and it was decided to build the plant at Oak Ridge, and keep a research and testing facility in Chicago.Delays in establishing the plant in Red Gate Woods led Compton to authorize the Metallurgical Laboratory to construct the first nuclear reactor beneath the bleachers of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. The reactor required an enormous amount of graphite blocks and uranium pellets. At the time, there was a limited source of pure uranium. Frank Spedding of Iowa State University were able to produce only two short tons of pure uranium. Additional three short tons of uranium metal was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant which was produced in a rush with makeshift process. A large square balloon was constructed by Goodyear Tire to encase the reactor. On 2 December 1942, a team led by Enrico Fermi initiated the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as Chicago Pile-1. The point at which a reaction becomes self-sustaining became known as ""going critical"". Compton reported the success to Conant in Washington, D.C., by a coded phone call, saying, ""The Italian navigator [Fermi] has just landed in the new world.""In January 1943, Grafton's successor, Major Arthur V. Peterson, ordered Chicago Pile-1 dismantled and reassembled at Red Gate Woods, as he regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area. At the Argonne site, Chicago Pile-3, the first heavy water reactor, went critical on 15 May 1944. After the war, the operations that remained at Red Gate moved to the new site of the Argonne National Laboratory about 6 miles (9.7 km) away.",90be43626e6e5e664b64112992cb22bf,What is the first name of the person who regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area?,Arthur,James,bert,042c84e9b534d44a93f97a4fe69de913,What is the full name of the person who replaced James?,Major Arthur V.

"Archie Moses is a small-time thief in Los Angeles who smuggles drugs for drug lord Frank Colton, who launders his drug money through a car dealership. Moses is unaware that his best friend, Rock Keats, is actually LAPD undercover cop Jack Carter, who befriended him only to infiltrate Colton's gang. Carter has Moses include him in Colton's next drug shipment, secretly planning to arrest Colton and take in Moses, whom he has come to care about, unharmed. Carter's undercover status is revealed before he can enact his plan, however, and a hurt Moses pulls a gun on him.

"Arthur Harris is the grumpy husband of Marion, who is terminally ill yet continues to participate with enthusiasm at her local seniors' choir, The OAP'Z. The choirmaster is a young teacher, Elizabeth who is preparing the choir to enter a local musical choir competition called ""Shadow Song"". Arthur is also estranged from his son, James. Marion's health deteriorates over time until one night when she dies in her sleep. Arthur initially takes this loss severely and cuts himself from his family and the choir. Eventually he agrees to take Marion's place in the choir. The transition proves to be a challenge for Arthur thanks to the unconventional songbook that includes racier songs such as Salt-N-Pepa's ""Let's Talk About Sex"" and Motorhead's ""Ace of Spades"". However he grows to enjoy spending time in the choir. On the eve of the competition, Arthur has an argument with James in a failed attempt to rebuild their relationship and pulls out of the choir. The choir participates in the competition without Arthur. He arrives later but before he can perform with the choir, they are eliminated from the competition by the judges. The choir are on their way to return home in defeat when Arthur stops the bus and storms the musical competition's stage shortly joined by the rest of the choir. They perform again with Arthur singing a solo of ""Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)"". The choir finishes in third place and returns home triumphant.

"As of 2013, Ratanakiri Province had a population of approximately 184,000. Its population nearly doubled between 1998 and 2013, largely due to internal migration. In 2013, Ratanakiri made up 1.3% of Cambodia's total population; its population density of 17.0 residents per square kilometer was just over one fifth the national average. About 70% of the province's population lives in the highlands; of the other 30%, approximately half live in more urbanized towns, and half live along rivers and in the lowlands, where they practice wetland rice cultivation and engage in market activities. Banlung, the provincial capital located in the central highlands, is by far the province's largest town, with a population of approximately 25,000. Other significant towns include Veun Sai in the north and Lomphat in the south, with populations of 2,000 and 3,000 respectively.In 2013, 37% of Ratanakiri residents were under age 15, 52% were age 15 to 49, 7% were age 50 to 64, and 3% were aged 65 or older; 49.7% of residents were male, and 50.3% were female. Each household had an average of 4.9 members, and most households (85.6%) were headed by men.While highland peoples have inhabited Ratanakiri for well over a millennium, lowland peoples have migrated to the province in the last 200 years. As of 2013, various highland groups collectively called Khmer Loeu made up approximately half of Ratanakiri's population, ethnic Khmers made up 36%, and ethnic Lao made up 10%. Within the Khmer Loeu population, 35% were Tampuan as of 1998, 24% were Jarai, 23% were Kreung, 11% were Brou, 3% were Kachok, and 3% were Kavet, with other groups making up the remaining one percent. There are also very small Vietnamese, Cham, and Chinese minorities.  Though the official language of Ratanakiri (like all of Cambodia) is Khmer, each indigenous group speaks its own language. Less than 10% of Ratanakiri's indigenous population can speak Khmer fluently.",258d3f782b275c0cd26aa5edea6552f4,What is the population of Lomphat?,"3,000","25,000.

"As the British fleet closed with the opposing combined fleets of France and Spain, Lord Nelson signalled all the necessary battle instructions to his ships. Aware of the momentousness of events to come, Lord Nelson felt that something extra was required. He instructed his signal officer, Lieutenant John Pasco, to signal to the fleet, as quickly as possible, the message ""England confides that every man will do his duty."" Pasco suggested to Nelson that expects be substituted for confides (i.e. is confident), since the former word was in the signal book, whereas confides would have to be spelt out letter-by-letter. Nelson agreed to the change (even though it produced a less trusting impression): His Lordship came to me on the poop, and after ordering certain signals to be made, about a quarter to noon, he said, 'Mr. Pasco, I wish to say to the fleet, ENGLAND CONFIDES THAT EVERY MAN WILL DO HIS DUTY' and he added 'You must be quick, for I have one more to make which is for close action.' I replied, 'If your Lordship will permit me to substitute the confides for expects the signal will soon be completed, because the word expects is in the vocabulary, and confides must be spelt,' His Lordship replied, in haste, and with seeming satisfaction, 'That will do, Pasco, make it directly.'

"At a jousting tournament in 14th-century Europe, young squires William Thatcher, Roland, and Wat discover that their master, Sir Ector, has died. If he had completed one final pass he would have won the tournament. Destitute, William wears Ector's armour to impersonate him, winning the tournament and taking the prize. Although only nobles are allowed in tournaments, William is now inspired to compete and win more prizes. Roland and Wat would rather take their winnings and leave, but William convinces them to stay and train him to joust. Along the way to his first tournament in Rouen, the trio encounters a young Geoffrey Chaucer, who is also destitute and agrees to forge the patent of nobility that will allow William to enter under the assumed name of ""Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein"" from Gelderland. At the tournament, William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment. In the course of competition, William's armor is damaged very badly. He goads Kate, a blacksmith, to repair it without payment and goes on to win the tournament's sword event. In the joust, he faces Sir Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honor of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust, Adhemar defeats William. At the prize ceremony, William vows revenge on Adhemar who then taunts William by telling him that he has been weighed, measured and found wanting.

"Audrey Alston encouraged Britten to go to symphony concerts in Norwich. At one of these, during the triennial Norfolk and Norwich Festival in October 1924,  he heard Frank Bridge's orchestral poem The Sea, conducted by the composer. It was the first substantial piece of modern music he had ever encountered, and he was, in his own phrase, ""knocked sideways"" by it. Audrey Alston was a friend of Bridge; when he returned to Norwich for the next festival in 1927 she brought her not quite 14-year-old pupil to meet him. Bridge was impressed with the boy, and after they had gone through some of Britten's compositions together he invited him to come to London to take lessons from him. Robert Britten, supported by Thomas Sewell, doubted the wisdom of pursuing a composing career; a compromise was agreed by which Britten would, as planned, go on to his public school the following year but would make regular day-trips to London to study composition with Bridge and piano with his colleague Harold Samuel.Bridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing and the maxim that ""you should find yourself and be true to what you found."" The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the Quatre Chansons Françaises, a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. Humphrey Carpenter and Michael Oliver judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught; Donald Mitchell considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle.",0e78797d1d3706ba621f4a198f424466,What is the first name of the person who had gone through some of Britten's compositions?,Frank,Robert,bert,bb7a6f488513963af187b698f0936591,What is the first name of the person who had gone through some of Britten's compositions?,Frank,14-year-old pupil to meet him.

"Barry Gabrewski is an asthmatic boy who lives with his widowed father, Jerry Gabrewski, in Houston, Texas. A loner, Barry has vivid daydreams about being Chuck Norris' sidekick, battling against Norris's movie enemies, who are often personified by Barry's everyday bullies such as Randy Cellini. Noreen Chan, his favorite teacher, often plays the damsel in distress in these daydreams. Barry wants to learn the martial arts, but is rejected by the arrogant dojo owner Kelly Stone for being too weak. Instead, he is taken on as a student by an old Chinese man called Mr. Lee, Noreen's sly uncle and the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, ""Frying Dragon"". Mr. Lee finds creative ways to teach Barry to defend himself from his bullies. Lee devises training methods that increase Barry's endurance, which helps his asthma. Lee also deduces Barry's hero worship of Norris, and from that at least some of Barry's daydreams. He creatively incorporates this into Barry's training, creating training scenarios that seem more dangerous than they are so that Barry will feel heroic for succeeding at them. Lee enters himself, Barry, and Chan into a local team Karate tournament but is a bit stymied to learn that a team must have four members. Norris is attending the tournament as a guest, and at Lee's urging, Chan convinces Norris to join the team. Norris is both willing to help an ardent fan and has his own motivation for participating: he has encountered Stone on several prior occasions and wants to teach him ""a lesson in humility"".

"Bean Bunny wishes he could help with the preparations for the Bunny Picnic, but he is told by his older brother Lugsy that he is too small and will only get in the way. Feeling very disappointed, Bean wanders off alone into the lettuce patch, where he imagines himself as the king of the bunny picnic and community and then encounters a farmer's dog, who chases him around the patch. Bean runs away and escapes the dog and warns the village, but none of the other bunnies believe him. They conclude that there is no dog and that Bean is simply making up the story for attention. At first, it seems that the farmer's dog is the story antagonist, but it is revealed that it is his master the farmer that wants him to get the bunnies for his stew. The dog is only trying to protect himself from the wrath of the farmer by hunting the bunnies. The bunnies soon discover that the dog is indeed real and out to get them. After much debating and futile attempts to rid themselves of the farmer's dog, the bunnies finally listen to Bean, who seems to have a solution to their problem. Inspired by a story about a giant hedgehog, they all hide inside of a giant bunny costume to frighten the dog, except Lugsy who went out for a sleeping potion only to get captured by the dog.

A playboy, he has devised an ingenious system for juggling three different girlfriends: by dating stewardesses who are assigned to international routes on non-intersecting flight schedules, only one woman is in the country at any given time. He has their comings and goings timetabled with such precision that he can drop off his British United Airways girlfriend for her outgoing flight and pick up his inbound Lufthansa girlfriend on the very same trip to the airport—while his Air France girlfriend is in a holding pattern elsewhere. With help from his long-suffering housekeeper Bertha (Thelma Ritter)—who swaps the appropriate photos and food in and out of the apartment to match the incoming girlfriend—none of the ladies is aware of each other's presence in the apartment. They regard Lawrence's flat as their ""home"" during their Paris layovers. Bernard is so happy with his life in Paris that he intends to turn down an imminent promotion that would require him to move to New York City. Bernard's life is turned upside down when his girlfriends' airlines begin putting new, state-of-the-art aircraft into service. These faster airplanes change all of the existing route schedules and allow the stewardesses to spend more time in Paris. Most alarming for Bernard, his three girlfriends will now all be in Paris at the same time. Robert Reed, a fellow journalist and an old acquaintance, complicates Bernard's life even further when he arrives in town and is unable to find a hotel room.

"Biker Queen, twin sister of Harley Mom, discovers the severed arm of her sister from the previous film. Upon discovering the surviving Bartender, she tortures him into telling her who killed Harley Mom. He reveals that it was Bozo and points her to a town where he lives. She knocks Bartender out and takes him with her to the town. Prior to the events of the first film, the town was overrun by the monsters. A pair of small Mexican wrestlers named Thunder and Lightning were attacked by the monsters and Lightning's girlfriend was killed. Inside the jail, a ""Hobo"" was in a cell for dealing methamphetamine and questioned where his school bus (makeshift meth lab) is at. The Sheriff taunted him before being killed. A car salesman named Slasher found evidence of his wife cheating with one of his employees and barely escaped the monsters. Biker Queen and four of her friends arrive in the deserted town with the Bartender, ignoring the dead bodies as they look for Bozo and cross paths with Slasher, his wife Secrets and the man she has an affair with, Greg. The group is attacked by a monster, which kills one of the biker girls, Tot Girl. The others and the Bartender make their way to Bozo's apartment, where they encounter Honey Pie, the girl who left the group from the first movie behind at the bar. Bartender brutally attacks her and knocks Honey Pie out of the window and onto the street. Honey Pie survives the fall and goes into hiding. Slasher, Greg and Secrets receive a call from the wrestlers, but before they find them they are ambushed by the bikers. Both groups get to a garage where the brothers and their grandmother are hiding.

"Bloc Party confirmed a preliminary track list of 13 songs in August 2006; this included future bonus tracks ""England"" and ""We Were Lovers"". A low-quality rip of A Weekend in the City was leaked in November and showed a track list of 11 songs. Wichita Recordings did not comment, but the band members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales. Bloc Party started a promotional tour of North America the same month with Panic! at the Disco, but cut it short after three concerts when Tong suffered a collapsed lung. The focus was changed to interviews throughout the world to explain the album's stylised lyrics and composition in the run-up to its release.Final tweaks on the album were completed in December 2006 in London. A high-quality version was leaked in January 2007 and its contents were confirmed by Okereke. Journalists who obtained an official copy of the album's final mix suggested that it featured electronically tampered rock soundscapes in the vein of Radiohead, New Order, and Björk. Bloc Party previewed A Weekend in the City in its entirety on 24 January 2007 at the Bournemouth Old Firestation, a performance which coincided with the Japanese release of the album. The first single, ""The Prayer"", was released on 29 January. The band performed at a special BBC Radio 1 showcase at Maida Vale Studios on 30 January as a precursor to a February promotional tour of the UK.The album was released in the rest of the world in the first week of February. The title comes as a tangent to the central theme of the album, ""the living noise of a metropolis"". The cover art is part of A Modern Project by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg, famous for her night cityscapes of London and for the cover art of The Streets' Original Pirate Material. The photograph is an aerial image of London's Westway, which shows the road and the adjacent sports pitches lit by the sodium glow of street lamps, and was chosen because the band believed ""it was important we captured London breathing"". Luxemburg has explained that ""in this picture you can see how intricately and optimistically public space in the city is shared"".",68b37f781c5629f4067000cbc04f079c,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,"Bloc Party started a promotional tour of North America the same month with Panic! at the Disco,",bert,6e16f23ba8f56ab6ced654b1784c549d,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,"Bloc Party started a promotional tour of North America the same month with Panic! at the Disco, but cut it short after three concerts when Tong",bert,5bb3d33c7b0a15961402a03a051824b9,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,Bloc Party,bert,23ac42de9891fb5baecdc4f624fc0e3c,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,"Panic! at the Disco, but cut it short after three concerts when Tong",bert,f4755c97b93b384154547fca2a7018ef,Whose members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales?,Bloc Party,Wichita Recordings,bert,1c611da91256295b8b4246f01fcf745f,Whose members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales?,Bloc Party,Rut Blees,bert,8a94c4618460c832f561bcabe685dd9f,Whose members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales?,Bloc Party,"Rut Blees Luxemburg,",bert,4bc2497ff4a510a618f650cf1a7787c7,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,"Panic! at the Disco,",bert,0d4987022bae7d2926900ccb61b3ca11,Whose members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album's content and sales?,Bloc Party,Party,bert,3b900f3f6c937c42ad41a12d7cfaf08c,Final tweaks on what were completed in December 2006 in London?,A Weekend in the City,Tong,bert,d6d325d431bb9e87145a37f619fd1287
"Boo-Boo Bear wakes up from winter hibernation, excited about the new Spring. Then Yogi Bear wakes up, his only interest finding some food to eat. Cindy Bear unsuccessfully tries to woo Yogi. After Ranger Smith thwarts Yogi's latest attempts to grab some food, Yogi gets angry and convinces the Ranger to transfer him out of Jellystone National Park. Smith prepares Yogi to be sent over to the San Diego Zoo along with an identification tag. Yogi first says goodbye to everything, but tricks another bear named Corn Pone into going to California instead of him and Boo-Boo and Cindy remain unaware of this, thinking Yogi has departed for good. Soon, Yogi is stealing food from all over the park under the alter ego ""The Brown Phantom"", but Smith believes it is another bear. He threatens whoever it is to be sent to the zoo. Cindy, wishing to be with Yogi at the zoo, angers Smith into mistakenly sending her away. However, she gets sent to the St. Louis Zoo instead, as the San Diego Zoo does not need any more bears. When she realizes her true destination, she gets very sad, crying since she knows she would be far from Yogi now. Late that night, Cindy falls out of the train and becomes lost.

"Boo-Boo Bear wakes up from winter hibernation, excited about the new Spring. Then Yogi Bear wakes up, his only interest finding some food to eat. Cindy Bear unsuccessfully tries to woo Yogi. After Ranger Smith thwarts Yogi's latest attempts to grab some food, Yogi gets angry and convinces the Ranger to transfer him out of Jellystone National Park. Smith prepares Yogi to be sent over to the San Diego Zoo along with an identification tag. Yogi first says goodbye to everything, but tricks another bear named Corn Pone into going to California instead of him and Boo-Boo and Cindy remain unaware of this, thinking Yogi has departed for good. Soon, Yogi is stealing food from all over the park under the alter ego ""The Brown Phantom"", but Smith believes it is another bear. He threatens whoever it is to be sent to the zoo. Cindy, wishing to be with Yogi at the zoo, angers Smith into mistakenly sending her away. However, she gets sent to the St. Louis Zoo instead, as the San Diego Zoo does not need any more bears. When she realizes her true destination, she gets very sad, crying since she knows she would be far from Yogi now. Late that night, Cindy falls out of the train and becomes lost.

"Border Patrol agents Bobby Logan and Ernie Wyatt are planting motion sensors in a remote area of the Texas desert when they stumble across what appears to a decades-old Jeep buried in the sand. Upon excavating the vehicle, they find an intact skeleton in the driver's seat, a toolbox containing $800,000 in unused 10 & 20 dollar bills, and a hunting case containing a scoped sniper rifle with matching ammunition. The skeleton is accompanied by a wallet, containing the driver's license of a Michael J. Curtis from San Antonio, and a slip of paper with two phone numbers on it. Logan speculates that the money is from a bank heist in the early 1960s, and suggests he and Wyatt and take the money for themselves.

"By September 1963, Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. They usually called themselves Sigma 6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided occasional vocals. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic.When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963, the remaining members asked Barrett and guitarist Bob Klose to join. Waters switched to the bass and by January 1964, the group became known as the Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. Sometime during late 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and by early 1966, Pink Floyd.By early 1966, Barrett was Pink Floyd's frontman, guitarist, and songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, released in August 1967. Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk"" (his first sole writing credit) to the album. By late 1967, Barrett's deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour, rendered him ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd's singer-songwriter and lead guitarist. In early March 1968 Pink Floyd met with managers Peter Jenner and Andrew King of Blackhill Enterprises to discuss the band's future. Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band ""agreed to Blackhill's entitlement in perpetuity"" regarding ""past activities"". The band's new manager Steve O'Rourke made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of David Gilmour in April 1968.",27c427a74e9e5aa7a88e27b4924b6f11,"What is the name of the Pink Floyd singer-songwriter and lead guitarist who was ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as either?",Barrett,Waters,bert,01106f5671dacd40e8606740744774bd,"What is the name of the album to which Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""?",The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The Piper at the Gates,bert,0642f3d1f3e2feeee1268c61e3523fb5,"What is the name of the Pink Floyd singer-songwriter and lead guitarist who was ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as either?",Barrett,Barrett's,bert,3675e684f9e804bec8cd5f0a3b3a385e,"What is the name of the album to which Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""?",The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The Piper,bert,6c48e43a82bdfe30af7d87167fc6f251,"What is the name of the Pink Floyd singer-songwriter and lead guitarist who was ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as either?",Barrett,"Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble",bert,4dff7d29148ef4e78158cb232a9c34a2,"What is the name of the Pink Floyd singer-songwriter and lead guitarist who was ""unable or unwilling"" to continue in his capacity as either?",Barrett,Keith Noble,bert,7886510aef3873dd6112f06023df481e,"What is the name of the album to which Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""?",The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The,bert,d2a8c10e1b49a5720637a0621456a061,"What is the name of the person who wrote or co-wrote all but one track of the debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, released in August 1967?",Barrett,Waters,bert,4c2485e8547dae0ac52473d91ed33c22,"What is the name of the album to which Waters contributed the song ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""?",The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,"Dawn,",bert,bd83f6c7fe739d99d7c916ba20181654,"What is the name of the person who wrote or co-wrote all but one track of the debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, released in August 1967?",Barrett,Barrett's,bert,163c0f5c578bab0d5e5d0763e87dd3fd

"Caversham has no secondary schools, although it does contain two primary schools and a special needs school. Caversham Primary School, at the corner of South Road and Surrey Street, has been at its present site since 1921. The school dates back to the early 1860s, and has a current enrollment of around 80 pupils. The school's two-storey 1920s brick buildings were pulled down and replaced in 1961, because of their structural unsoundness. The school's main gate – the only surviving remnant of the earlier structure – is the suburb's war memorial.College Street School, south of South Road's retail area, was built on an earlier site of Caversham Primary School. It was officially part of Caversham Primary School until 1959, when it was declared a separate institution, and now has about 250 pupils. A third school, the Sara Cohen School in Rutherford Street, was established in 1926. This school caters for special needs pupils from primary school age through adulthood. The school was named for the late wife of Mark Cohen, city councillor, campaigner for women's rights, and editor of the Evening Star newspaper from 1893 to 1920.

"Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (Italian: [ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi] (listen); 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, string player and choirmaster. A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history. Born in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c. 1590–1613) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di capella at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics. Much of Monteverdi's output, including many stage works, has been lost. His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals, large-scale sacred works such as his Vespro della Beata Vergine (Vespers) of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera L'Orfeo (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice, including Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea. While he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony, such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica, contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the prima pratica. Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.",fa9c862b9cbff1ef68fcd105d7dd7b2e,What is the last name of the person who was a composer of both secular and sacred music?,Monteverdi,Monteverdi (Italian: [ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi],bert,dbabcb7fc7c6c8314dda9c859600f568,What is the last name of the person who worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony?,Monteverdi,"his life he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice, including Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria",bert,e297067cedac1ea15a714d17112131e0,What is the last name of the person who is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history?,Monteverdi,Monteverdi (Italian: [ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi],bert,ecfc4bb740fa23f9f39c4c6433a60605,What is the last name of the person who undertook his first musical studies and compositions in Cremona?,Monteverdi,"he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice,",bert,e7cef600b53ccea4a3a79359140621ec,What is the last name of the person who is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history?,Monteverdi,Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (Italian: [ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi],bert,1714fef2c07159b1e34aa483d4160ca5,What is the last name of the person who was maestro di capella at the basilica of San Marco?,Monteverdi,di,bert,421b6b5cf77e45bb24de0a35bb248c8a,What is the last name of the person who was a composer of both secular and sacred music?,Monteverdi,di,bert,7a414921c3635459b49a61f6ddd64631,What is the last name of the person whose surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period?,Monteverdi,di,bert,b501bc4f96bb9da4f4564623d3734d97,What is the last name of the person whose surviving music includes nine books of madrigals?,Monteverdi,Monteverdi's,bert,2d4f4e836a77ed802e6a93edff4a61dc,What is the last name of the person who worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony?,Monteverdi,Monteverdi (Italian: [ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi],bert,07a43539684fd89c63a91b8ed8df6aa4

"Darren Silverman, Wayne LeFessier, and J.D. McNugent, best friends since fifth grade and Neil Diamond fans throughout, form a Neil Diamond tribute band called ""Diamonds in the Rough"". Darren meets a beautiful but domineering psychologist who is showing signs of being emotionally abusive, Judith Fessbeggler, through a chance encounter in a local bar after a band gig. Six weeks into their relationship, Darren asks Judith if whether they could finally have sex, but Judith refuses in the belief that premarital sex is wrong; rather, she suggests non-penetrative sex as alternative, during which Darren gets nothing but a sore jaw. Judith isolates Darren from his friends, demands that Darren quit the band, receive humiliating medical procedures, and attend relationship counseling under her care. Wayne and J.D. decide to save Darren from her by attempting to bribe her, arm wrestle her, and shock her with faked photographs of Darren cheating, all to no avail. The friends, undaunted, try to reunite Darren with his ""one and only"", Sandy Perkus, when she returns to Seattle to take her final vows as a nun. When Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith. However, Judith eventually discovers the identity of her captors, and the duo are convinced they cannot let her go. When they visit Coach Norton in jail (who accidentally killed a referee in a fit of rage) his advice is that they should just kill her. The pair attempt to shoot Judith, but end up deciding against it. Sandy's feelings for Darren are reawakened, but the pair's attempted date is ruined by Darren's preoccupation with Judith.

"Dinky Bossetti is a 15-year-old girl who was adopted as a baby. She appears to have little acceptance in her social circle, although it is not obvious which came first - her antisocial attitude or her being rejected by her peers. Her adoptive mother Rochelle is disappointed that the daughter she chose has no interest in ""feminine"" things, such as makeup and nice clothing. Her classmates ostracize, taunt, and throw things at her regularly. Dinky finds solace in her ""Ark"", a small cabin-boat beached on a lake shore.

"Dr. John Rollason, his wife, Helen, and assistant, Peter Fox, are guests of the Lama of the monastery of Rong-buk while on a botanical expedition to the Himalayas. A second expedition, led by Dr. Tom Friend accompanied by trapper Ed Shelley, photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide Kusang, arrives at the monastery in search of the legendary Yeti or Abominable Snowman. Rollason, despite the objections of his wife and the Lama, decides to join Friend's expedition. Whereas Rollason is motivated by scientific curiosity to learn more about the creature, Friend seeks fame and fortune and wants to capture a live Yeti and present it to the world's press. The expedition climbs high into the mountains and finds a set of giant footprints in the snow, evidence of the Yeti's existence. As the tensions between Rollason and Friend rise, McNee is injured by a bear trap laid by Friend to catch the Yeti and later dies in a fall. Kusang flees back to the monastery from where Helen and Fox decide to mount a rescue mission. Meanwhile, Shelley succeeds in shooting and killing a Yeti, an act that enrages the creature's fellows. When Shelley is killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen, Friend finally decides to cut his losses and leave with the body of the dead Yeti. However, the Yeti close in on the two survivors and Friend is killed in an avalanche. Rollason takes refuge in an ice cave and watches in amazement as a number of Yeti arrive and take away the body of their fallen compatriot. He realises the Yeti are an intelligent species biding their time to claim the Earth when humanity has destroyed itself. The rescue party finds Rollason and brings him back to the monastery where, when questioned by the Lama, he claims the expedition found nothing (apparently the result of telepathic hypnosis by the Yetis).",4250c9dd7311176d69e01271f9a8cd2e,What is the profession of the person who falls and dies?,photographer,"trapper Ed Shelley, photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide",bert,230e569b4d76b2f1aa01823728fa2b7d,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,photographer,bert,c6642c9ebcea1e8637ef2a75977a3a05,What is the profession of the person who falls and dies?,photographer,photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide,bert,32604dcb5275c25651c3f1653593c6eb,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,"trapper Ed Shelley, photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide",bert,d55a1ffd140162e5f95dfff7bff7645b,What happens to the photographer on the expedition in the mountains?,injured by a bear trap,an avalanche,bert,b3a892ea02f111825a0b4b8f7578c761,Where does the Sherpa guide go after McNee dies?,back to the monastery,the Himalayas.,bert,061b7690197a5b61a3d08853d9e8fb8e,What happens to the photographer on the expedition in the mountains?,injured by a bear trap,Abominable Snowman.,bert,e99f560b0dd8fd035be57c1f5e3390f5,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,"photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide Kusang, arrives at the monastery in search of the legendary Yeti or Abominable Snowman.",bert,954600966a0e08520caa3d8a5f4f728c,How does the trapper die?,killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen,injured by a bear trap laid by Friend to catch the Yeti and later dies in a fall.,bert,0cf0707f30a14524831d9fde31e8ce8e,What does the person who runs back to the monestary do as a profession?,Sherpa guide,photographer Andrew McNee and Sherpa guide,bert,be3cd1720abe5891e88f3b37e4c6daa9

"Dr. Watson is serving as resident doctor at Musgrave Manor in Northumberland, a stately home which is also used as a hospital for a number of servicemen suffering from shell shock.When Sally Musgrave displays her feelings for one of the wounded American fighter pilots, Captain Pat Vickery, who is currently recovering at the family estate, her brothers Geoffrey and Phillip are quick to show their dismay. Then one of the physicians working at the estate, Dr. Sexton, is assaulted by an unknown assailant when out on a walk. Dr. John Watson, who is in charge of the medical facility, goes to fetch his dear friend Sherlock Holmes to bring some clarity to the case of the attack.

"Duncan McLeod, a gentleman artist and former Naval officer, assisted by his crewman Lefty Brown, engages in smuggling contraband liquor between France and Britain across the English Channel. Duncan and Lefty store the liquor at the Quiet Woman, a local pub in their coastal town, only to find one day that its complicit owner has moved away without telling them, and the pub is now being run by Jane Foster and her maid Elsie. Jane makes clear that she does not approve of activities that break the law, and demands that Duncan and Lefty remove their cache of contraband liquor from her property immediately or she will contact customs officials.

"During the late 12th century, about 100 years after the Norman conquest (1066), the Normans have removed the native ruling class, replacing it with a new monarchy, aristocracy and clerical hierarchy. Thomas Becket is a Saxon protégé and facilitator to the carousing King Henry II, who transforms into a man who continually invokes the ""honour of God"".

"Early industries in the area included C & W Sheil's brickworks, which had quarries in Forbury, St Clair and Caversham, and Caversham Gasworks, which operated from 1882 until 1909. The last buildings of the gasworks were a local landmark, and were not removed until the construction of the Caversham bypass in the 1970s and 1980s. Other noted industries in early Caversham included breweries, a tannery, and a match factory.Construction of the South Island Main Trunk railway south of Dunedin that began in 1871 led to the construction of a 865-metre (2,838 ft) tunnel beneath Lookout Point, connecting Caversham with Green Island. A second parallel 1,407-metre (4,616 ft) tunnel – the first double-track tunnel in the country – was built starting in 1907, and all rail traffic moved to the new tunnel in 1910. Caversham was served by its own railway station until its closure in 1962. There has been a long-running campaign to have the older tunnel converted into a cycleway, though this scheme has never gained wholehearted council support.By the 1870s the population of Caversham was growing rapidly, and in 1877, with the population at around 4,000, it was declared a borough. It held this status until amalgamation with Dunedin city in 1904. The borough's area included much of modern Forbury and St Clair, as well as what is usually regarded as Caversham today.",bd0ce5947eccb66dc4e2461fc001ff6f,What did the older tunnel that there's a been a campaign to convert into a cycleway run under?,Lookout Point,Caversham was served by its own railway station,bert,83a85e104708f929c9beff2ed0313666,What did the older tunnel that there's a been a campaign to convert into a cycleway run under?,Lookout Point,tunnel,bert,aac996ed11575366302ec7a1d2ecdfe0,What early industry in the area had buildings that were a local landmark?,Caversham Gasworks,"C & W Sheil's brickworks,",bert,c7655af38578c66f5542b17fe83f5cf5,What early industry in the area had buildings that were a local landmark?,Caversham Gasworks,brickworks,bert,dc07709670abbaf928034401c09733ca,What early industry in the area had buildings that were a local landmark?,Caversham Gasworks,"brickworks, which had quarries in Forbury, St Clair and Caversham, and Caversham Gasworks,",bert,705da5c896ae567bbb376364b41bf1f5,What early industry in the area had buildings that were a local landmark?,Caversham Gasworks,"C & W Sheil's brickworks, which had quarries in Forbury, St Clair and Caversham, and Caversham Gasworks,",bert,8b0e7d3da61c6e3cb9e663b4b2051564,What did the older tunnel that there's a been a campaign to convert into a cycleway run under?,Lookout Point,"Lookout Point, connecting Caversham with Green Island.

"Eshmun was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the Phoenician pantheon and the main male divinity of Sidon. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to Babylonian deity Tammuz. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes.The myth of Eshmun was related by the sixth century Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius. They recount that Eshmun, a young man from Beirut, was hunting in the woods when Astarte saw him and was stricken by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he emasculated himself with an axe and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of heaven.From a historical perspective, the first written mention of Eshmun goes back to 754 BC, the date of the signing of the treaty between Assyrian king Ashur-nirari V and Mati'el, king of Arpad; Eshmun figures in the text as a patron of the treaty.Eshmun was identified with Asclepius as a result of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC.

This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the Awali river which was dubbed Asclepius fluvius, and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.",f6e03461b6e8a17b4ef4b0595e2d298e,What is the name of the grieving goddess?,Astarte,Eshmun was equated to Babylonian deity Tammuz.,bert,01caf6e7d1c9aa9d9c23843996fc1768,What is the name of the entity that grieved for Eshmun?,Astarte,Asclepius.,bert,caa8a48061bac35260bbdb019fa04664,What is the name of the person who revived Eshmun?,Astarte,Damascius,bert,dcc587b2b7bfc610280599b3b424e4cc,Who was the main male divinity of Sidon equated with?,Tammuz,"Tammuz.

"Eve Gill is an aspiring actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. She is interrupted in rehearsal by her friend (and crush), actor Jonathan Cooper, the secret lover of flamboyant stage actress/singer Charlotte Inwood. Via a flashback, he says Charlotte visited him after killing her husband; she was wearing a bloodstained dress. Jonathan claims he went back to her house for another dress, but was seen by Nellie Goode, Charlotte's cockney maid/dresser. He escaped the police and needs help.

"Ex special forces mercenary and now hardened criminal Vic, (Michael Lazar) lives in a world of cons, double crosses, crooked cops, mob bosses and drug dealing crime lords. Playing by his own rules, Vic and his partner Frank work both sides of the street, caring only about where they can score and take down the most cash. After a dangerous shootout during a drug deal gone bad, Vic finds himself working for ruthless crime boss Paul Santo. Santo's being indicted for murder, and he enlists Vic and Frank to kill the three witnesses that will testify against him. Watching Vic's every move is Santo's strongest soldier, Ray, (Michael Madsen) a stone cold killer, who would like nothing better than to whack Vic and Frank the moment his boss gives him the okay. As the Asian proverb says, ""In the shadow of every crime is a woman"" and that holds true for Vic as his grifter girlfriend Thea and Frank's ex, the exotic, sultry, Layla have their own agendas as they both try in their own way to use and manipulate their men. As Vic tries to juggle all this as well as kill the witnesses to pay off his debt to Santo, and at the same time avoid Ray's wrath, he is pursued by crooked vice cop Ford who's relentless as he turns up the heat on Vic and Frank. On top of all this, it doesn't help that Asian crime lord, Cho and his henchman Butch are applying their own brand of pressure on Vic and Frank.

"Farmer Al Falfa arrives in New York City by taxi. Yards away, a man with binoculars on a rooftop looks for visitors to rob until setting sights on Al. The man phone calls a femme fatale woman and tells her to meet him. The woman finds and invites Al to come with her to a night club. At the night club, Al and the woman drink some wine. After consuming two glasses, he becomes intoxicated and collapses. While Al is flat on the floor, the woman heads to his bag, and takes some valuables before running off. Coming out of the bag is Al's dog which barks to wake up its master. Just after exiting the night club, Al, who still has hangover, decides to lay his back on a lightpost. Momentarily, a hefty man comes and greets him. Figuring he has lots of cash, the hefty man invites and takes Al to the latter's buddies. Al meets the hefty man's three friends at a poker room who then entice him to a high-stakes poker game. Over the course of the play, Al's stacks of chips become smaller and smaller. One of the poker players then employ an illegal strategy of secretly trying to pass cards to another player. Al, who is suspicious of the game, opens his bag and releases his dog which snatches and brings the cards to him.

"Farthest South was the most southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911. Significant steps on the road to the pole were the discovery of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing of the Antarctic Circle in 1773, and the earliest confirmed sightings of the Antarctic mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911. In the years before reaching the pole was a realistic objective, other motives drew adventurers southward. Initially, the driving force was the discovery of new trade routes between Europe and the Far East. After such routes had been established and the main geographical features of the earth had been broadly mapped, the lure for mercantile adventurers was the great fertile continent of ""Terra Australis"" which, according to myth, lay hidden in the south. Belief in the existence of this supposed land of plenty persisted well into the 18th century; explorers were reluctant to accept the truth that slowly emerged, of a cold, harsh environment in the lands of the Southern Ocean. James Cook's voyages of 1771–74 demonstrated conclusively the likely hostile nature of any hidden lands. This caused a shift of emphasis in the first half of the 19th century, away from trade and towards sealing and whaling, and then exploration and discovery. After the first overwintering on continental Antarctica in 1898–99 (Adrien de Gerlache), the prospect of reaching the South Pole appeared realistic, and the race for the pole began. The British were pre-eminent in this endeavor, which was characterized by the rivalry between Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Shackleton's efforts fell short; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen.",552cd9c4c2f793f42bd5557992766d49,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Ernest,bert,a3ae23d3d8ecf2b2b156adb1e3d9a7ce,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton,bert,438cd42f6bdbc957bcf1c345ca78d8da,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton,bert,28ed52e77161b729d5ed7e6e5b79566a,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert Falcon Scott,bert,821eac39f6c3fcec88d4cb3b794208d1,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Robert Falcon,bert,9e34e6cc1bc7965532a02a6e590c3716,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest,bert,513fc0e0731302fc61bc15f4c33673bf,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert,bert,600907bf60cd621b4b8c696103ab05d9,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert Falcon,bert,f897b8246337013bbaee4faa78b900c4,What is the first name of the person who reached the pole in January 1912?,Robert,Robert Falcon Scott,bert,9f092c8dca074b01dbd99b55a07bdee2,What is the first name of the person whose efforts fell short?,Ernest,Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest,bert,bea11cb1f4eae6160b9524b02c75ee85
"Fauré is regarded as one of the masters of the French art song, or mélodie. Ravel wrote in 1922 that Fauré had saved French music from the dominance of the German Lied. Two years later the critic Samuel Langford wrote of Fauré, ""More surely almost than any writer in the world he commanded the faculty to create a song all of a piece, and with a sustained intensity of mood which made it like a single thought"". In a 2011 article the pianist and writer Roy Howat and the musicologist Emily Kilpatrick wrote: His devotion to the mélodie spans his career, from the ever-fresh ""Le papillon et la fleur"" of 1861 to the masterly cycle L'horizon chimérique, composed sixty years and more than a hundred songs later. Fauré's songs are now core repertoire for students and professionals, sung in conservatories and recital halls throughout the world. In Copland's view, the early songs, written in the 1860s and 1870s under the influence of Gounod, except for isolated songs such as ""Après un rêve"" or ""Au bord de l'eau"", show little sign of the artist to come. With the second volume of the sixty collected songs written during the next two decades, Copland judged, came the first mature examples of ""the real Fauré"". He instanced ""Les berceaux"", ""Les roses d'Ispahan"" and especially ""Clair de lune"" as ""so beautiful, so perfect, that they have even penetrated to America"", and drew attention to less well known mélodies such as ""Le secret"", ""Nocturne"", and ""Les présents"". Fauré also composed a number of song cycles. Cinq mélodies ""de Venise"", Op. 58 (1891), was described by Fauré as a novel kind of song suite, in its use of musical themes recurring over the cycle. For the later cycle La bonne chanson, Op. 61 (1894), there were five such themes, according to Fauré.

"Film publicist Lee Phillips is tasked with promoting a film featuring a husband-wife acting team, Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas. His job is complicated by the fact that the eccentric director of the film, Hal Weidmann, refuses to show anyone a cut of the film, demanding the first viewing take place at a press junket. To promote the film and to save his job, Lee decides to focus on the two stars: Gwen and Eddie, once known as ""America's Sweethearts"". Unfortunately, they are now going through an ugly split. Gwen had an adulterous affair with her co-star Hector Gorgonzolas, who she now lives with, driving Eddie to an emotional breakdown. His actions after their split led Gwen to take out a restraining order against Eddie, and he is now living at a New Age retreat.

Now 20 years old, he is being pressed by his father, Stoick the Vast, to succeed him as chieftain, although Hiccup feels unsure he is ready.

"Following Operation Tungsten, British intelligence assessed that Tirpitz would be repaired within six months. Accordingly, Cunningham directed Fraser on 13 April to launch another attack on the battleship. While Cunningham did not believe that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, he hoped that further air strikes would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. Fraser initially resisted Cunningham's order, arguing that the prospects for a successful raid were poor as the Germans would have reinforced the defences around Tirpitz and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. He eventually relented, and Moore sailed from Scapa Flow on 21 April to attack Kaafjord again. This raid, designated Operation Planet, was called off on 24 April due to bad weather over the target area. Two other attacks, Operation Brawn and Operation Tiger Claw, also had to be cancelled on 15 and 28 May respectively because of adverse weather. Further carrier raids were attempted in July and August after Allied intelligence determined that the repairs to Tirpitz were nearing completion. During Operation Mascot a force of 42 Barracudas and 40 fighters attacked Tirpitz on 17 July, but did not score any hits as the battleship was hidden by a smokescreen. A further four carrier raids were conducted against Kaafjord between 22 and 29 August during Operation Goodwood, but these caused only light damage to the battleship.In late August it was decided that further Fleet Air Arm attacks should not be attempted as the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. As it was still seen as desirable to destroy Tirpitz, the task was assigned to Bomber Command. On 15 September a force of heavy bombers attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this, Tirpitz sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø to be used as an immobile coastal defence battery.

"Following the execution of her mother, Anne Boleyn, for infidelity, Elizabeth is exiled to Hatfield House and declared illegitimate (thereby losing her place in line of succession the throne) by her father, King Henry VIII. She is accompanied by her loyal servants, Mr. Parry and her governess Mrs. Ashley. Over the years, her position rises and falls on the whim of her father. The child is periodically summoned to return to London to become acquainted with Henry's latest spouse. When Henry marries his last wife, Catherine Parr, the now-teenage Elizabeth finally rebels against her latest summons.

"Following the release of The Final Cut, Waters embarked on a solo career. In 1984, he released his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a project about a man's dreams across one night that dealt with Waters' feelings about monogamy and family life versus ""the call of the wild"". In the end the character, Reg, chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album featured guitarist Eric Clapton, jazz saxophonist David Sanborn, and artwork by Gerald Scarfe. Kurt Loder described The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking as a ""strangely static, faintly hideous record"". Rolling Stone rated the album a ""rock bottom one star"". Years later, Mike DeGagne of AllMusic praised the album for its ""ingenious symbolism"" and ""brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm"", rating it four out of five stars.Waters began touring in support of the album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a selection of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. The tour suffered from poor ticket sales and some performances at larger venues were cancelled; Waters estimated that he lost £400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff—North America Tour 1985. The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA.In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated movie When the Wind Blows, based on the Raymond Briggs book of the same name.

"For combination of grace, dramatic strength, and clearness in technique this picture would be difficult to surpass. There is nothing finicky about it; it tells its story with vivid directness. As a background to the figure Mrs. Rix Nicholas has set a piece of antique tapestry, so that the trees on either side lean in arch-wise over the head, the face and shoulders stand out clearly against an expanse of sky, and behind the body and limbs extends a countryside full of towers and rivers and trees. The quaint conventionality of this background accords exactly with the late eighteenth-century costume, all sprigged with roses and heliotrope; and the whole mass of detail harmonies [sic] perfectly with the type of the model's face. It is a cold, selfish face. The artist has brought out with revealing strokes an expression of vindictive malice which is for the moment resting there; and the hands, the fingers of one grasped tightly by the other, give a clear indication of nervous tension within. The treatment of flesh tones and the general arrangement, drawing attention gently but not too obtrusively to the columbines scattered on the polished floor—those are excellent. While she exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France, she was also creating many new works, including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume, produced during a summer in Brittany. In 1926, Rix Nicholas was again included in London's Royal Academy of Art exhibition, where one of her Brittany paintings, Le Bigouden, was hung.

"Former FBI secretary Erin Grant loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell, who is a criminal and cost Erin her job. To afford an appeal to get her daughter back, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a strip club in Miami. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and becomes infatuated with Erin. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the congressman to settle the custody battle and help her get Angela back. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from Darrell's negligent care. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter.

"Frankie Bono, a mentally disturbed hitman from Cleveland, comes back to his hometown in New York City during Christmas week to kill a middle-management mobster, Troiano. The assassination will be risky, with Frankie being warned by a fellow enforcer that should he be spotted before the hit is performed, the contract will be reneged. First he follows his target to select the best possible location, but opts to wait until Troiano isn't being accompanied by his bodyguards. Next, he goes to purchase a revolver from Big Ralph, an obese gun runner who keeps sewer rats as pets. The encounter with this old acquaintance leaves Frankie feeling disgusted.

"Franklin Bean is shown in flashback with his father, a postal worker at his high school. His poor performance is attributed to a lack of discipline which a school officials assures the elder Bean can be fixed with a stint in the Army. Then, in present day, PFC Bean is attending his father's funeral before returning to his duty station in Germany. In his state of grief he gets drunk, punches an MP and breaks through a plate-glass window in a local bar. Bean's army lawyer secures a plea deal, struck by his attorney Captain Ramon Garcia, in lieu of a court martial which involves him removing unauthorized tattoos from his hands (obtained during his drunken rampage), paying for a broken window and serving 90 days in the camp stockade. He is met at the gates by a decorated Korean War veteran Master Sergeant named Otis McKinney.

"George Harrison began writing ""Something"" in September 1968, during a session for the Beatles' self-titled double album, also known as ""the White Album"". In his autobiography, I, Me Mine, he recalls working on the melody on a piano, at the same time as Paul McCartney recorded overdubs in a neighbouring studio at London's Abbey Road Studios. Harrison suspended work on the song, believing that with the tune having come to him so easily, it might have been a melody from another song. In I, Me, Mine, he wrote that the middle eight ""took some time to sort out"". The opening lyric was taken from the title of ""Something in the Way She Moves"", a track by Harrison's fellow Apple Records artist James Taylor. While Harrison imagined the composition in the style of Ray Charles, his inspiration for ""Something"" was his wife, Pattie Boyd. In her 2007 autobiography, Wonderful Today, Boyd recalls: ""He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful ...""

"Harrison first introduced ""Something"" at a Beatles session on 19 September 1968, when he played it to George Martin's stand-in as producer of The Beatles, Chris Thomas, while the latter was working out the harpsichord part for Harrison's track ""Piggies"". Despite Thomas's enthusiasm for the new composition, Harrison chose to focus on ""Piggies"". He told Thomas that he intended to offer ""Something"" to singer Jackie Lomax, whose debut album Harrison was producing for Apple Records. ""Something"" was not among the tracks released on Lomax's album, however, much of which was recorded in Los Angeles following the completion of the White Album.After Harrison rejoined the Beatles in January 1969 for their Get Back film project (later released as Let It Be), ""Something"" was one of many recent compositions that he offered to the group. Leng describes this period as a prolific one for Harrison as a songwriter, comparing it with John Lennon's peak of creativity over 1963–64, yet Harrison's songs received little interest from Lennon and McCartney amid the tense, uncooperative atmosphere within the band. Martin was also unimpressed by ""Something"" at first, considering it ""too weak and derivative"", according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore.The Beatles rehearsed the song at Apple Studio on 28 January. With the proceedings being recorded by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg for the planned documentary film, tapes reveal Harrison discussing his unfinished lyrics for ""Something"" with Lennon and McCartney, since he had been unable to complete the song's second line, which begins ""Attracts me ..."" To serve as a temporary filler, Lennon suggested ""like a cauliflower"", which Harrison then altered to ""like a pomegranate"". In their study of the available tapes, Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that the Beatles gave the song two run-throughs that day, which was the only occasion that they attempted it during the Get Back/Let It Be project.",35f591450bc5ab2db2b55f0de21d195d,What is the first name of the person who discussed the unfinished lyrics with Harrison and McCartney?,John,George,bert,02970b3b5d91f564f81b0708ac24998c,What is the first name of the person who discussed the unfinished lyrics with Harrison and McCartney?,John,Mikal Gilmore.The Beatles rehearsed the song at Apple Studio on 28 January.

""Something"" was not among the tracks released on Lomax's album, however, much of which was recorded in Los Angeles following the completion of the White Album.After Harrison rejoined the Beatles in January 1969 for their Get Back film project (later released as Let It Be), ""Something"" was one of many recent compositions that he offered to the group. Leng describes this period as a prolific one for Harrison as a songwriter, comparing it with John Lennon's peak of creativity over 1963–64, yet Harrison's songs received little interest from Lennon and McCartney amid the tense, uncooperative atmosphere within the band. Martin was also unimpressed by ""Something"" at first, considering it ""too weak and derivative"", according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore.The Beatles rehearsed the song at Apple Studio on 28 January. With the proceedings being recorded by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg for the planned documentary film, tapes reveal Harrison discussing his unfinished lyrics for ""Something"" with Lennon and McCartney, since he had been unable to complete the song's second line, which begins ""Attracts me ..."" To serve as a temporary filler, Lennon suggested ""like a cauliflower"", which Harrison then altered to ""like a pomegranate"". In their study of the available tapes, Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that the Beatles gave the song two run-throughs that day, which was the only occasion that they attempted it during the Get Back/Let It Be project.",c71c59e52e24f695a07c2649dd4e81c4,"What is the first name of the person who made the suggestion to use the phrase ""Like a cauliflower?""",John,George,bert,5ff311f2d03d5a1a205ba43d8c4a23d3,"What is the first name of the person who showed little interest in ""Something"" with McCartney?",John,Jackie,bert,832b9953ad1c5c4ea5170e2367f63a7a,What is the first name of the person who discussed the unfinished lyrics with Harrison and McCartney?,John,"George Martin's stand-in as producer of The Beatles, Chris",bert,266c2bf927eb71de7fd19e999b964db7,What is the first name of the person who discussed the unfinished lyrics with Harrison and McCartney?,John,Michael,bert,865a5a9b767e437a5f7f7209d9c75640,"What is the first name of the person who showed little interest in ""Something"" with McCartney?",John,Michael,bert,3503e6dd7810ec578f5bdd2474360a61,"What is the first name of the person who made the suggestion to use the phrase ""Like a cauliflower?""",John,Jackie,bert,9bd327b0a2a510019b5a3b0e0fe699e2,"What was the first name of the person who was unimpressed by ""Something"" at first?",George,George Martin's,bert,ff19e48effe21a69821e9eba76fe7456,"What was the first name of the person who was unimpressed by ""Something"" at first?",George,"George Martin's stand-in as producer of The Beatles, Chris",bert,3ea020eb137873f156a1079d15af9504,"What was the first name of the person who was unimpressed by ""Something"" at first?",George,Jackie,bert,0cb045db2269b9b1fee2d1c599259bb7,"What is the first name of the person who made the suggestion to use the phrase ""Like a cauliflower?""",John,Michael,bert,b80b4c792753b5021d91db8f2dd8d814
"Head girl Justine Fielding is escorted out of Fairview High School by the police, as other pupils look on. Five days earlier, Justine is reading at the funeral of unpopular, asthmatic student Darren Mullet. She starts to talk about him, when Mullet's equally unpopular friend, Jason Banks (Olly Alexander), stands up in church and angrily calls her a hypocrite because she did not really know him. He is then thrown out by the sadistic P.E. teacher. Later on, Justine is talking to her friend Helena when school heart-throb Alex decides to invite her to a party that his popular friends, Bradley, Tasha, Khalillah, Sophie and Marcus are having. She decides to go. At the party, when Justine arrives, Tasha tells Jez, the DJ, to say something about her appearance. He begins to rap about her in an unflattering manner. When Alex tells him to stop, he is literally thrown out of the party by Bradley. Later, Alex and Justine go to one of the bedrooms and kiss. Meanwhile, Bradley, Tasha, Khalillah, Marcus and Sophie all receive insulting and degrading text messages from Mullet's number. During this, someone puts on a clown costume and grabs a chainsaw, before heading up to Alex and Justine. It turns out to be Bradley, who is pranking them. Jez goes to the cemetery and urinates on Mullet's grave.

"Hilda Rix Nicholas (née Rix, later Wright, 1 September 1884 – 3 August 1961) was an Australian artist. Hilda Rix was born in the Victorian city of Ballarat. Her father was an education administrator and poet, her mother was a musician and artist. She studied under a leading member of the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin, at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905 and was an early member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Following the death of her father in 1907, Hilda Rix, her only sibling Elsie and her mother travelled to Europe where she undertook further study in London and then in Paris. Her teachers during the period included John Hassall, Richard Emil Miller and Théophile Steinlen. After travelling to Tangiers in 1912, Rix held several successful exhibitions of her work, with one drawing, Grande marche, Tanger, purchased by the French government. She was one of the first Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, was made a member of the Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français, and had works hung in the Paris Salon first in 1911 and again in 1913. The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of World War I. A period of personal tragedy followed, as Rix's sister died in 1914, then her mother in 1915. In 1916 she met and married George Matson Nicholas, only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the Western Front. Returning to Australia in 1918, Rix Nicholas once more took up professional painting, and held an exhibition of over a hundred works at Melbourne's Guild Hall. Many sold, including In Picardy, purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Following a period painting in rural locations in the early 1920s, Rix Nicholas returned to Europe. A 1925 exhibition in Paris led to the sale of her work In Australia to the Musée du Luxembourg, followed by an extensive tour of her paintings around regional British art galleries. There followed representation in other exhibitions, including at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and the Royal Academy of Arts, both in London. Following the inclusion of several works in the 1926 Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris she was made an Associate of that organisation.",0e144889b0272fbb08311a0f278bcd40,What is the full name of the person who studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School?,Hilda Rix Nicholas,"Hilda Rix Nicholas (née Rix, later Wright, 1 September 1884 – 3 August 1961) was an Australian artist.

"Hillsboro () is the fifth-largest city in the State of Oregon and is the county seat of Washington County. Lying in the Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area, the city hosts many high-technology companies, such as Intel, that comprise what has become known as the Silicon Forest. At the 2010 Census, the city's population was 91,611.For thousands of years before the arrival of European-American settlers, the Atfalati tribe of the Kalapuya lived in the Tualatin Valley near the later site of Hillsboro. The climate, moderated by the Pacific Ocean, helped make the region suitable for fishing, hunting, food gathering, and agriculture. Settlers founded a community here in 1842, later named after David Hill, an Oregon politician. Transportation by riverboat on the Tualatin River was part of Hillsboro's settler economy. A railroad reached the area in the early 1870s and an interurban electric railway about four decades later. These railways, as well as highways, aided the slow growth of the city to about 2,000 people by 1910 and about 5,000 by 1950, before the arrival of high-tech companies in the 1980s. Hillsboro has a council–manager government consisting of a city manager and a city council headed by a mayor. In addition to high-tech industry, sectors important to Hillsboro's economy are health care, retail sales, and agriculture, including grapes and wineries. The city operates more than twenty parks and the mixed-use Hillsboro Stadium, and ten sites in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Modes of transportation include private vehicles, public buses and light rail, and aircraft using the Hillsboro Airport. The city is home to Pacific University's Health Professions Campus. Notable residents include two Oregon governors.",3471e3f5d25251df353c184e8e702b28,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,Hillsboro () is the fifth-largest city in the State of Oregon,bert,cbfdfd522e6e938f98555f393591c26a,What city was named after David?,Hillsboro,Hillsboro () is the fifth-largest city in the State of Oregon,bert,10766d0ee27b76a81a6f6a4f575a1355,What city was named after David?,Hillsboro,Tualatin Valley near the later site of Hillsboro.,bert,1d5842eb293659e3b6ebecae6ecbb49f,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland,bert,4c493c14dcc1bac76dbcaa1112fd4b66,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,Portland,bert,aadac90c04a71338b772d1c1f80927b7,What city was named after David?,Hillsboro,boro,bert,b54160a6ff35a7692087084b165d855b,What city was named after David?,Hillsboro,Hillsboro's,bert,5b2537f81a0936c80aed6b277d197794,What is on the east side of Hillsboro?,the Portland metropolitan area,"Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area,",bert,578b4854d6a98c99de973be87b8b1c02,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,State of Oregon,bert,13501602c74c9507448139592336b309,What city is Intel located in?,Hillsboro,Oregon,bert,179e2619f27b0ca33aac34a07eabbb40
"Houses in rural Ratanakiri are made from bamboo, rattan, wood, saek, and kanma leaves, all of which are collected from nearby forests; they typically last for around three years. Village spatial organization varies by ethnic group. Kreung villages are constructed in a circular manner, with houses facing inwards toward a central meeting house.  In Jarai villages, vast longhouses are inhabited by all extended families, with the inner house divided into smaller compartments.  Tampuan villages may follow either pattern.Nearly all Khmer Loeu are animist, and their cosmologies are intertwined with the natural world. Some forests are believed to be inhabited by local spirits, and local taboos forbid cutting in those areas. Within spirit forests, certain natural features such as rock formations, waterfalls, pools, and vegetation are sacred. Major sacrificial festivals in Ratanakiri occur during March and April, when fields are selected and prepared for the new planting season. Christian missionaries are present in the province, and some Khmer Loeu have converted to Christianity. The region's ethnic Khmer are Buddhist. There is also a small Muslim community, consisting mainly of ethnic Cham.Because of the province's high prevalence of malaria and its distance from regional centers, Ratanakiri was isolated from Western influences until the late 20th century. Major cultural shifts have occurred in recent years however, particularly in villages near roads and district towns; these changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials, and NGO workers. Clothing and diets are becoming more standardized, and traditional music is being displaced by Khmer music.  Many villagers have also observed a loss of respect for elders and a growing divide between the young and the old. Young people have begun to refuse to abide by traditional rules and have stopped believing in spirits.",87819ec0701a347ceda4ebd730b05f5d,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,Major cultural,bert,88e4cd1ba8bcc8ecfda33cb83deb2e10,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,Major,bert,3148579d2195d1ab2462e6f826f4799b,What types of housing are used by Tampuan villages?,longhouses,"bamboo, rattan, wood",bert,63b7b4f15f40af1e70264b5e18c96216,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,shifts,bert,fdd1d2e5055a98daa70cba6bec9fbbce,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,cultural shifts,bert,8e64ffa0d82d76479d8d6bf395889927,What types of housing are used by Tampuan villages?,longhouses,vast longhouses,bert,35ed96a3f831accf767ddcbcce9d8b4e,"What type of changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials and NGO workers?",Major cultural shifts,cultural,bert,2e062476626ade5723d3926bbdd647b4,What types of housing are used by Tampuan villages?,longhouses,"Jarai villages, vast longhouses",bert,150272f0a2b2362a5dcd6759480ed86e,What types of housing are used by Tampuan villages?,longhouses,bamboo,bert,b52e0852bb36b73fa7beca407344d8e6,What types of housing are used by Tampuan villages?,longhouses,"Kreung villages are constructed in a circular manner, with houses facing inwards toward a central meeting house.

"In 1630s New England, English settler William and his family — wife Katherine, daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas — are banished from a Puritan Plymouth Colony over a religious dispute. They build a farm near a large, secluded forest and Katherine has a newborn child, Samuel. One day, Thomasin is playing peekaboo with Samuel when the baby abruptly disappears. It is revealed that a witch had stolen the unbaptized Samuel and that night kills him and uses his blood and fat to make a flying ointment.Katherine, devastated, spends her days crying and praying, while William insists a wolf stole the baby. Even though Katherine forbids the children going to the forest, William takes Caleb to lay a trap for food. Caleb asks if Samuel's unbaptized soul will reach Heaven. William chastises Caleb for raising the question and later reveals to Caleb that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her cup while implying Thomasin was responsible for Samuel's vanishing. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family. Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check the trap in the forest. She forces Caleb to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. While walking in the woods, they spot a hare, which sends their horse Burt into a panic and their dog Fowler promptly chases. Caleb runs off after the pair, while the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon Fowler's disemboweled body. As he gets deeper into the woods, he comes across a hovel, where a beautiful young woman emerges and seduces him. William finds Thomasin and takes her home. Katherine angrily chastises Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods and, to save Thomasin, William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's silver cup.",a4d542eec76ccf148b0fd8f9c97b2581,What is the name of the family pet that chases the rabbit?,Fowler,"hare, which sends their horse Burt",bert,b4b9f39fa025f0c5b43973983ecb9758,What is the name of the family pet that chases the rabbit?,Fowler,Burt,bert,af029a4df3a628f7ee1e4a6beb7a84c2,What is the name of the person that Katherine thinks took Samuel?,Thomasin,William takes Caleb to lay a trap for food.

"In 1783, Kitty is caught trying to pick the pocket of the painter Thomas Gainsborough. He offers to pay her more to sit for a portrait for him. There, she attracts the attention of Sir Hugh Marcy and the Earl of Carstairs. Sir Hugh, upon finding out her real social status, offers her a job as a scullery maid. Kitty learns that he is impoverished, having lost his post in the foreign office due to a scandal. Gainsborough's portrait, The Anonymous Lady, creates a stir, as people try to guess who the subject is. The Duke of Malmunster buys both that painting and Gainsborough's The Blue Boy. When the duke asks Gainsborough who the model is, Sir Hugh claims she is his aunt's ward. The duke admits he may have been mistaken in having Sir Hugh dismissed from his position (in favor of the duke's nephew), and in exchange for an introduction to Kitty ""Gordon"", offers to reinstate him.

"In 1783, Kitty is caught trying to pick the pocket of the painter Thomas Gainsborough. He offers to pay her more to sit for a portrait for him. There, she attracts the attention of Sir Hugh Marcy and the Earl of Carstairs. Sir Hugh, upon finding out her real social status, offers her a job as a scullery maid. Kitty learns that he is impoverished, having lost his post in the foreign office due to a scandal. Gainsborough's portrait, The Anonymous Lady, creates a stir, as people try to guess who the subject is. The Duke of Malmunster buys both that painting and Gainsborough's The Blue Boy.

"In 1792 during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, a secret league of brave Englishmen are rescuing French aristocrats from the guillotine. The leader of this secret society is a mysterious English nobleman known only as the Scarlet Pimpernel, whose signature sign is a humble wayside flower. In society he hides his identity by posing as the wealthy but foppish and seemingly empty-headed Sir Percy Blakeney. After rescuing the Count de Beaulieu and his family, Percy is introduced to the beautiful French actress Marguerite St. Just (Jane Seymour) through her brother, Armand, whom he rescued from an attack. Percy is attracted to Marguerite, but she is in a relationship with Paul Chauvelin, an agent of Maximilien Robespierre. Due to the Scarlet Pimpernel's past successes, Chauvelin is assigned to discover his identity and capture him. After Percy and his associates smuggle another aristocrat out of the city while picnicking with Marguerite, Chauvelin deduces that the Scarlet Pimpernel must be an English nobleman, and tries to coerce the Count de Tournay to spy on the English court for the Republic. Later, Marguerite and Chauvelin have an argument over the executions and he angrily departs. Percy reveals his identity to Armand and convinces him to use his connections to Chauvelin to investigate the French prison holding the Dauphin, son of the former King of France. Soon after, the Scarlet Pimpernel and his associates rescue de Tournay's family.",06a6adf45b3f1c70a266dd8e03e784bc,What is the full name of the person who rescued someone from an attack?,Scarlet Pimpernel,Sir Percy Blakeney.,bert,c158aa5d7dc02afb5a55fde438f9457b,What is the full name of the person who rescued someone from an attack?,Scarlet Pimpernel,Marguerite St. Just,bert,7de53d05838980fe4faf3ae9e46d7337,What is the full name of the person who rescued someone from an attack?,Scarlet Pimpernel,"Sir Percy Blakeney.

"In 1814 Young first exchanged correspondence about the stone with Jean-François Champollion, a teacher at Grenoble who had produced a scholarly work on ancient Egypt. Champollion saw copies of the brief hieroglyphic and Greek inscriptions of the Philae obelisk in 1822, on which William John Bankes had tentatively noted the names ""Ptolemaios"" and ""Kleopatra"" in both languages. From this, Champollion identified the phonetic characters k l e o p a t r a (in today's transliteration q l i҆ w p ꜣ d r ꜣ.t). On the basis of this and the foreign names on the Rosetta Stone, he quickly constructed an alphabet of phonetic hieroglyphic characters, which appears in his famous 1822 ""Lettre à M. Dacier"" sent to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Paris Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and immediately published by the Académie. In the postscript Champollion notes that similar phonetic characters seemed to occur in both Greek and Egyptian names, a hypothesis confirmed in 1823, when he identified the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches at Abu Simbel. These far older hieroglyphic inscriptions had been copied by Bankes and sent to Champollion by Jean-Nicolas Huyot. From this point, the stories of the Rosetta Stone and the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs diverge, as Champollion drew on many other texts to develop an Ancient Egyptian grammar and a hieroglyphic dictionary which were published after his death in 1832.",b2104bf996d87b35267df59f1ed65982,What is the full name of the author of Lettre à M.

"In 1905 a scandal erupted in French musical circles over the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome. Fauré's pupil Ravel had been eliminated prematurely in his sixth attempt for this award, and many believed that reactionary elements within the Conservatoire had played a part in it. Dubois, who became the subject of much censure, brought forward his retirement and stepped down at once. Appointed in his place, and with the support of the French government, Fauré radically changed the administration and curriculum. He appointed independent external judges to decide on admissions, examinations and competitions, a move which enraged faculty members who had given preferential treatment to their private pupils; feeling themselves deprived of a considerable extra income, many of them resigned. Fauré was dubbed ""Robespierre"" by disaffected members of the old guard as he modernised and broadened the range of music taught at the Conservatoire. As Nectoux puts it, ""where Auber, Halévy and especially Meyerbeer had reigned supreme ... it was now possible to sing an aria by Rameau or even some Wagner – up to now a forbidden name within the Conservatoire's walls"". The curriculum was broadened to range from Renaissance polyphony to the works of Debussy.Fauré's new position left him better off financially. However, while he also became much more widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling to earn a living as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).",f87998e42f7ac54ccd7f5c2b9781806c,What is the name of the person that would return to Paris in early October?,Fauré,Debussy.Fauré's,bert,dc766596418181212f51125dd6fbfc66,What is the name of the person that wrote Barcarolles Nos. 7–11?,Fauré,"(Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).",bert,d2db03ca840d1fe2b1fc6c957040437d,What is the name of the person that wrote Nocturnes Nos. 9–11?,Fauré,Fauré's pupil Ravel,bert,13a870b61dde606a8af7ef11be35ad6c,What is the name of the person that would leave Paris in the last days of July?,Fauré,Fauré's pupil Ravel,bert,e8fdc9c43ebe7d4687843cafc4b7307c,What is the name of the person that would leave Paris in the last days of July?,Fauré,Ravel,bert,e0ed371349f166517a2703a28eb963bf,What is the name of the place that many of the faculty members resign from?,Conservatoire,"Fauré's pupil Ravel had been eliminated prematurely in his sixth attempt for this award, and many believed that reactionary elements within the Conservatoire",bert,d0be571ad76c3e2ee98fb71ff99af9e7,What is the name of the person that allowed Wagner to be taught at the Conservatoire?,Fauré,Nectoux,bert,9c431cb22d82929e7d5ff483354b6761,What is the name of the person that allowed Wagner to be taught at the Conservatoire?,Fauré,"Dubois,",bert,9ea978e1bfe4272fe0c3ecb42f060749,What is the name of the person that would leave Paris in the last days of July?,Fauré,Debussy.Fauré's,bert,4d30da510daf70e52876903b4cc41963,What is the name of the person that spent the summer months by one of the Swiss lakes?,Fauré,Ravel,bert,8921d949e6e94b6e53574701b18c47ba

"In 1933, Freya Roth is a young German girl engaged to a Nazi party member. When she realizes the true nature of his political views she breaks the engagement and turns her attention to anti-Nazi Martin Breitner. Her father, Professor Roth, does not abide by the attitude of the new order towards scientific fact. Though his stepsons Erich and Otto eagerly embrace the regime, Professor Roth's reluctance to conform leads at first to a boycott of his classes and eventually to his arrest and a sentence of forced physical labor.

"In 1939, Martin Kamen and Samuel Ruben of the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley began experiments to determine if any of the elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half-lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research. They synthesized 14C using the laboratory's cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that the atom's half-life was far longer than had been previously thought.  This was followed by a prediction by Serge A. Korff, then employed at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, that the interaction of thermal neutrons with 14N in the upper atmosphere would create 14C. It had previously been thought that 14C would be more likely to be created by deuterons interacting with 13C. At some time during World War II, Willard Libby, who was then at Berkeley, learned of Korff's research and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating.In 1945, Libby moved to the University of Chicago where he began his work on radiocarbon dating. He published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include 14C as well as non-radioactive carbon. Libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with methane collected from sewage works in Baltimore, and after isotopically enriching their samples they were able to demonstrate that they contained 14C. By contrast, methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age. The results were summarized in a paper in Science in 1947, in which the authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin.Libby and James Arnold proceeded to test the radiocarbon dating theory by analyzing samples with known ages. For example, two samples taken from the tombs of two Egyptian kings, Zoser and Sneferu, independently dated to 2625 BC plus or minus 75 years, were dated by radiocarbon measurement to an average of 2800 BC plus or minus 250 years. These results were published in Science in 1949.  Within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide. In 1960, Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.",70a7e1e6435a90da58eee0b087cea16d,"What are the last names of the people who, within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide?",Libby,Zoser,bert,0fb5e000f09dcedb3902e15a511d8339,"What are the last names of the people who, within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide?",Libby,Kamen,bert,aa23271c0400b82911acb14392e87f07,"What are the last names of the people who, within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide?",Libby,origin.Libby,bert,d979da4fc92cb16ae921f28bc0bb2f6f,What is the full name of the person whose research Libby learned of and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating?,Serge A.

"In 1955, Paul Hindemith revised the work to achieve more clarity. According to Wolfgang Rathert, Hindemith ""sought to moderate Reger's 'uncontrolled invention'"", while Kirshnit described Reger's original scoring as ""gloriously polychromatic"". Hindemith ""thinned"" the orchestra, especially the horns. In Reger's scoring, the organ reinforced the voices throughout the piece, resulting in a lack of clarity for the polyphonic passages. Hindemith used the organ only for climaxes. In the double fugue, he assigned one theme to a voice, but the other simultaneous theme to the orchestra. Hindemith's approach, which enables more analytical listening, seems justified by Reger's own scoring of later compositions which were more refined and focused.

"In 2002, in Norwich, England, UK, 10-year-old Zak Bevis is engrossed by the WWF (now WWE) King of the Ring pay-per-view event until his younger sister Saraya changes the channel to her favorite program, Charmed. The siblings wrestle, urged on by their parents Rick and Julia. Rick books the children for their first wrestling match where Saraya, initially reluctant to wrestle a boy, goes on to win as planned. At 18, competing under the ring name ""Britani Knight"", Saraya and her brother ""Zak Zodiac"" help their parents train prospective wrestlers while working toward their own promotion. Rick and Julia, struggling financially, ask WWE trainer Hutch Morgan to sign the siblings. He finally agrees to a tryout before a SmackDown taping at The O2 Arena, and tells Saraya to find a different name as they ""already have a Britani"". The siblings receive advice from Dwayne Johnson, and Saraya adopts the name Paige from her favorite character on Charmed.  The two try out with several other wrestlers and are all belittled by Morgan. He ultimately chooses Paige over the rest, despite her attempt to have Zak signed as well. With her brother's encouragement, Paige leaves for America while Zak continues wrestling on the British independent circuit, assisting his parents' wrestling school, and tending to his girlfriend and newborn son. Arriving at NXT in Florida, Paige has difficulty adjusting to the WWE style of entertainment – chiefly, the absence of intergender competition and the inexperience of her fellow female trainees Jeri-Lynn, Kirsten, & Maddison. Paige struggles with performing promos and Morgan's constant belittlement. Morgan makes it clear to Zak that he will never be signed to WWE, and Zak falls into alcoholism.

"In 2002, in Norwich, England, UK, 10-year-old Zak Bevis is engrossed by the WWF (now WWE) King of the Ring pay-per-view event until his younger sister Saraya changes the channel to her favorite program, Charmed. The siblings wrestle, urged on by their parents Rick and Julia. Rick books the children for their first wrestling match where Saraya, initially reluctant to wrestle a boy, goes on to win as planned. At 18, competing under the ring name ""Britani Knight"", Saraya and her brother ""Zak Zodiac"" help their parents train prospective wrestlers while working toward their own promotion. Rick and Julia, struggling financially, ask WWE trainer Hutch Morgan to sign the siblings. He finally agrees to a tryout before a SmackDown taping at The O2 Arena, and tells Saraya to find a different name as they ""already have a Britani"". The siblings receive advice from Dwayne Johnson, and Saraya adopts the name Paige from her favorite character on Charmed.  The two try out with several other wrestlers and are all belittled by Morgan. He ultimately chooses Paige over the rest, despite her attempt to have Zak signed as well. With her brother's encouragement, Paige leaves for America while Zak continues wrestling on the British independent circuit, assisting his parents' wrestling school, and tending to his girlfriend and newborn son. Arriving at NXT in Florida, Paige has difficulty adjusting to the WWE style of entertainment – chiefly, the absence of intergender competition and the inexperience of her fellow female trainees Jeri-Lynn, Kirsten, & Maddison. Paige struggles with performing promos and Morgan's constant belittlement. Morgan makes it clear to Zak that he will never be signed to WWE, and Zak falls into alcoholism.

"In 2012, American songwriter and record producer Benny Blanco met with Norwegian production duo StarGate at a recording studio in New York City to write new songs, including one for Rihanna. StarGate had previously produced her singles ""Don't Stop the Music"" (2007) and ""Only Girl (In the World)"" (2010). According to Blanco, he and StarGate wanted to deviate from Rihanna's usual sound and produce as though the song would be for a rapper such as Kanye West: ""It's the one that we weren't thinking Rihanna ... that turned into the Rihanna record ... But that's how it always happens like with me"". They produced the song's drum machine beat after the other instrumental music was recorded.StarGate's Mikkel Eriksen told The New York Times that Blanco took a recorded snippet of Eriksen's singing, altered it electronically, and made it sound ""dirtier"". He then applied timbre and used audio software to create ghostly accompaniment lines. Eriksen described Blanco's style as ""unorthodox, as he almost never plays the keyboards but throws in weird samples and alters them to the right pitch to go with the song."" Australian singer-songwriter Sia later joined them and wrote the lyrics for ""Diamonds"" in 14 minutes.After the song was completed, they wanted to play it to Rihanna, but Blanco was skeptical about the reaction towards the song because of its slow sound. After StarGate played it to her, they called Blanco from London and told him that she liked the song: ""She's flippin' out. She played it like seven times in a row. It's her favorite song."" Phil Tan and the assistant Daniela Rivera, mixed and mastered ""Diamonds"". Recalling it, in an interview with The Huffington Post, Blanco commented, ""we needed to have it recorded, the beat finished, mixed and mastered in 24 hours.

"In February 1954 Gao Gang, the head of the State Planning Council, was purged from government; he killed himself only months later.  His presence in the painting immediately on Mao's left placed arts officials in a quandary.  Given its popularity among officials and the people, The Founding of the Nation had to be shown at the Second National Arts Exhibition (1955), but it was unthinkable that Gao, deemed a traitor, should be depicted.  Accordingly Dong was ordered to remove Gao from the painting, which he did. Wu Hung described The Founding of the Nation as ""arguably the most celebrated work of official Chinese art"".  He noted that the painting is the only ""canonized"" one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze.  The painting is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae, the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person.  Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting ""the most significant historical image of China's founding"".  Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel the changes that have come to China's leadership during the years of Communist governance.  Andrews wrote that ""its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting"".  Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it ""a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles"".

"In Hollywood, director Fred Amiel, movie star Georgia Lorrison, and screenwriter James Lee Bartlow each refuse to speak by phone to Jonathan Shields in Paris. Movie producer Harry Pebbel gathers them in his office and explains that Shields was calling them because he has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project.  Shields cannot get financing on his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem.  Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer. As they await Shields' call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields.  The backstory of their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire ""extras"" to attend his funeral.  Despite the industry's ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood by any means necessary. Shields partners with aspiring director Amiel, whom he meets at his father's funeral. Shields intentionally loses money he does not have in a poker game to film executive Pebbel, so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a line producer. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making B movies for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a $1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to be chosen as director.  The film's success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel comes to work for him there.  Amiel, now independent of Shields, goes on to become an Oscar-winning director in his own right.",32254c52e39096a6bc10e3dfdf78836b,What are the full names the people Harry Pebbel gathers in his office?,Fred Amiel,"Georgia Lorrison,",bert,f12bcf7daeb0bc85563d2d49a98dd71d,What is the last name of the person who becomes a Oscar-winning director in his own right?,Amiel,"Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel comes to work for him there.

"In Jerusalem, a rabbi named Rostenburg is using software he designed to decode seventy eschatological prophecies hidden within the Torah. Rostenburg has handwritten each one in a journal, to be entered into the program for deciphering. The program deciphers a prophecy which says that he is about to die; immediately, he tears the page containing the final code from his journal, hiding it in his shirt pocket. He is then shot and killed by an assassin, who takes his journal and the optical disc containing the decoding program. After the assassin leaves, two mysterious men (later revealed to be two prophets) retrieve the journal page Rostenburg had hidden. Television reporter and talk show host Cassandra Barris introduces Dr. Gillen Lane as her show's guest. Lane is a popular author and charismatic motivational speaker who explains that codes hidden in the Old Testament describe events past, present, and future; he sees no contradiction between this belief and his dismissal of religious faith. Media mogul and European Union Chairman Stone Alexander receives a humanitarian award in Rome for having all but eliminated world hunger through advances in nutritional technology. There, we see that the man who killed Rostenburg and stole his decoding software is Alexander's apprentice, Dominic. Dr. Lane is in attendance, seeking to meet with Alexander ""to discuss some ideas."" Cassandra, employed by one of Alexander's television networks, is also in attendance, providing Lane brief conversation after Alexander spurns him. Some time afterward, however, Alexander sees a prophecy (deciphered with Rostenberg's program) that leads him to ask Lane to become his Minister of Information.",c69068b22cabebd8812957662fa9110f,What is the full name of the person that was spurned by Alexander?,Dr. Gillen Lane,Cassandra Barris introduces Dr. Gillen Lane,bert,3b2bd5ce63e1e4171ed84449da16d8cd,What three people are in attendance where Stone Alexander receives a humanitarian award?,Dominic,"Dr. Lane is in attendance, seeking to meet with Alexander ""to discuss some ideas.""

"In July 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell hosts a house party where guests watch Neil Armstrong's televised first human steps on the Moon. Afterwards Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on Apollo 8, tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon to walk on its surface. Three months later, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's Vertical Assembly Building, his boss Deke Slayton informs him that because of problems with Alan Shepard's crew, his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their new mission. A few days before launch, Mattingly is exposed to the measles, and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, Jack Swigert. Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband getting killed in space, but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off. On April 11, 1970, Flight Director Gene Kranz gives the go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for the Apollo 13 launch. As the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage fires to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the maneuver to connect the Command/Service Module Odyssey to the Lunar Module Aquarius and pull it away from the spent rocket.",2ea503d22531e0d3734c4ec9c22bbb06,Which astronaut was replaced by Swigert?,Mattingly,"Ken Mattingly,",bert,a9690d163689a17d7b59615f39e0cc06,Which astronaut was replaced by Swigert?,Mattingly,"Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their new mission.

"In March 1943, DuPont began construction of a plutonium plant on a 112-acre (0.5 km2) site at Oak Ridge. Intended as a pilot plant for the larger production facilities at Hanford, it included the air-cooled X-10 Graphite Reactor, a chemical separation plant, and support facilities. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot. The X-10 Graphite Reactor consisted of a huge block of graphite, 24 feet (7.3 m) long on each side, weighing around 1,500 short tons (1,400 t), surrounded by 7 feet (2.1 m) of high-density concrete as a radiation shield.The greatest difficulty was encountered with the uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow had to be coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a hot dipping process without success. Meanwhile, Alcoa tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure rate of more than 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of General Electric, which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.Watched by Fermi and Compton, the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical on 4 November 1943 with about 30 short tons (27 t) of uranium. A week later the load was increased to 36 short tons (33 t), raising its power generation to 500 kW, and by the end of the month the first 500 mg of plutonium was created. Modifications over time raised the power to 4,000 kW in July 1944. X-10 operated as a production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities.",e171820da12ad857f2702e2da38c26a9,Where was DuPont planning to build a larger plant?,Hanford,Oak Ridge.,bert,845cda5e627b1deba456d5dc69e2043c,In what month was the first plutonium created?,November,"October 1943.Watched by Fermi and Compton, the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical on 4 November",bert,2e5fa9a1ca36d305bcce684e51ec5111,In what month was the first plutonium created?,November,4 November 1943,bert,f6ca590b67c27fd62daecb06ba1bfb93,Where was DuPont planning to build a larger plant?,Hanford,"at Oak Ridge.

"In New York City, high-strung equity trader Joy Ellis McNally is dumped by her fiancé at a surprise birthday party she throws for him. At the same time, easy-going carpenter Jack Fuller is fired from his job by his father, Jack, Sr. Both become emotionally distraught and, with best friends Toni ""Tipper"", a bartender, and Jeff ""Hater"", a lawyer, take a debauched trip to Las Vegas. Joy and Jack meet by chance when they are given the same hotel room because of a computer error. After clearing up the misunderstanding and receiving upgraded rooms and coupons to various clubs, they party and drink together and end up getting married. The next morning, they realize it was a mistake and decide to divorce. Before they do so, Jack uses a quarter Joy gives him in a slot machine.

The family has a birthday party and one of the decorations is a basket with balloons strapped to it. Out of curiosity, Napoleon hops inside, but the basket, untied from its tether, begins to float away. Napoleon flies high above the city and heads out to the sea. A galah named Birdo drops down on the side of his basket and offers to help him get down. Birdo's idea of help is to pop the balloons suspending the basket, causing Napoleon to land unharmed on a beachhead. Napoleon thinks he can finally seek out the wild dogs and heads into a nearby forest, ignoring Birdo's suggestion to return home. At night, Napoleon starts to fear being alone. A mopoke in the forest warns Napoleon of terrible things that can happen to pets in the wild, but Napoleon ignores him as well and continues on his way. He discovers a large tree used by a psychotic cat as a home. The cat spots Napoleon and, thinking he is a mouse, chases him. Napoleon escapes when the mopoke pushes the cat into a pond. The mopoke then warns Napoleon that the cat will not rest until he is dead. As Napoleon runs off, the cat pulls herself from the pond angrily swearing revenge. The next morning, Napoleon once again encounters Birdo, who decides to teach Napoleon how to live in the wild.",b0558379cc3786d5afa2b343f73d5d39,What does Napoleon's human family call him?,Muffin,"Muffin is living with a human family and his own mother.

"In a positive review of the song, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave it four out of five stars and praised Rihanna's direction towards a ""softer and more prolific edge"". Brittany Lewis of GlobalGrind called ""Diamonds"" a catchy song and felt that it had the potential to be another hit for Rihanna. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that, although it does not sound like an emphatic hit, the lyrical content of the song depicts a ""personal shift"" for Rihanna. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, ""Diamonds"" is more positive than previous singles such as ""We Found Love"" and ""Where Have You Been"", despite its moderate tempo. Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's singing is stronger than ever. Contactmusic's reviewer described it as a ""laid-back track"", and suggested that the lyrical content is related to her former boyfriend Chris Brown. In a track-by-track review of Unapologetic, Andrew Hampp of Billboard found the song inspiring and commented that it ""finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date"". Andy Kellman of Allmusic cited the song as one of the highlights on Unapologetic, and gave it three and a half stars.In a less enthusiastic critique, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times likened ""Diamonds"" to a James Bond movie theme song, but with ""insipid lyrics"". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News felt that the song is not as evocative as it attempts to be and lacks the sense of mystery and engaging production found on ""We Found Love"". Kevin Blair of the Irish Independent's, Independent Woman, was critical of the song for deviating from Rihanna's previous dance and R&B songs and dismissed it as a ""chugging, faintly misty-eyed, middle of the road pop song"". Chris Richards of The Washington Post panned the song as a ""power ballad without much power"".",59505dea88e707ba7996954973f63abc,What song did Jim Farber feel had a better production?,"""We Found Love""","Love"".",bert,4437be45c946d5560b422882eebc68f2,What is the name of the person whose former boyfriend is suggested by Contactmusic's reviewer to be related to the lyrical content of Diamonds?,Rihanna,Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's,bert,bb72fac726083b45c4e27e9763bf49c4,"What is the name of the track described as ""laid-back"" by Contactmusic's reviewer?",Diamonds,"""We Found Love""",bert,aea563d5e2e0c2e220488acfa397777e,"What was the name of the song that was describes as a ""laid-back track""?","""Diamonds""","""We Found Love""",bert,7d80564fd84ba0c73a494382ae00187b,"What is the name of the song found to be inspiring by Andrew Hampp, who commented that it ""finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date""?",Diamonds,"""We Found Love""",bert,05654e5da7bef7a9092483c4c3536a2b,What is the name of the person whose former boyfriend is suggested by Contactmusic's reviewer to be related to the lyrical content of Diamonds?,Rihanna,Rihanna's,bert,a51a081aeecae709d72f62ab37af3d8e,What is the name of the song that Andrew Hampp found the song inspiring?,"""Diamonds""","""We",bert,bbdb71c5c2b5518107d0aa238065e90a,"What was the name of the song that was describes as a ""laid-back track""?","""Diamonds""","""Diamonds"" is more positive than previous singles such as ""We Found Love""",bert,6a86acd4d81693ceda9b652a9ce18688,"What is the name of the track described as ""laid-back"" by Contactmusic's reviewer?",Diamonds,"""Diamonds"" is more positive than previous singles such as ""We Found Love""",bert,5afa30b4719ec194a9718c1a837a4036,What is the name of the song that Andrew Hampp found the song inspiring?,"""Diamonds""","Love"".",bert,98cc7da01a411c47399d8a28af6366c3
"In a quiet English town, seventeen-year-old Jo Halliday lives a fairly boring life working as a hairdresser and living at home, with her nagging mother, pompous father, and fitness-obsessed Aunt. Her father, an accountant, continually wishes that his dreamy, untidy daughter could be more like his secretary Miss Jones. One morning the local newspaper reveals that Jo has authored a book—The Naked Revolt—which is an instant bestseller. It tells the story of a young girl who discovers the truth about her family and neighbours, and flees to London to become a prostitute. Unfortunately the town's residents believe the book to be a true reflection of the family. Her father finds himself under suspicion at work, as his colleagues believe he has been stealing money, and her mother is regarded as a harlot who has been conducting a twenty-year affair with a retired army officer who gives her driving lessons and is Jo's real father. Her local doctor is painted as a philanderer who is sexually involved with a number of his patients while ignoring the desperate advances of his drunken assistant, Jo's aunt. In fact, these things are all untrue: her father is scrupulously honest and in love with her mother; the local doctor is a shy man, and the former army officer is simply a family friend. Jo has left town for London with a young playwright who is interested in turning her book into a play. After discovering they are kindred spirits, the two become engaged. When they return home Jo is confronted by her angry family and neighbours. The doctor is threatening to sue, and her father and mother have begun questioning each other's fidelity.",ab09b2fd6b99f90e2b1ecbb81453eaa6,What is the full name of the person whose father wishes they could be more like the secretary?,Jo Halliday,seventeen-year-old Jo Halliday,bert,d19bc476bae467f2bc04689663b45f38,What is the full name of the person whose father wishes they could be more like the secretary?,Jo Halliday,Jo,bert,0bc7d0b73ec9fc36af4e221fe78b3dfc,What is the first name of the person whose mother is regarded as a harlot?,Jo,Jo's,bert,ec3f4a6193e0df61f047f61b73baa936,What is the first name of the person whose local doctor is painted as a philanderer?,Jo,Jo's,bert,52a1687fe9e39ced9fbe3d94d3f545b1,What is the first name of the person whose father finds himself under suspicion at work?,Jo,Jo has authored a book—The Naked Revolt—which is an instant bestseller.

"In early 2005, Frusciante entered the studio to work on his fifth and final studio album with the Chili Peppers, Stadium Arcadium. His guitar playing is dominant throughout the album, and he provides backing vocals on most of the tracks. Although usually following a ""less is more"" style of guitar playing, he began using a full twenty-four track mixer for maximum effect. In the arrangements, he incorporates a wide array of sounds and playing styles, similar to the funk-influenced Blood Sugar Sex Magik or the more melodic By the Way. He also changed his approach to his playing, opting to contribute solos and allow songs to be formed from jam sessions. In an interview from Guitar World, Frusciante explained how he approached his guitar solos for their album Stadium Arcadium completely differently from those for their previous albums. On Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication, Frusciante had a general idea how he wanted his guitar solos to sound. For Stadium Arcadium, almost every guitar solo was completely improvised by Frusciante on the spot. Several reviews have stressed that the influence of Hendrix is evident in his solos on the album, with Frusciante himself backing this up. He also expanded the use of guitar effects throughout the album, and used various other instruments such as the synthesizer and mellotron. He worked continuously with Rubin over-dubbing guitar progressions, changing harmonies and using all his technical resources.Frusciante began a series of collaborations with friend Omar Rodríguez-López and his band The Mars Volta, by contributing guitar and electronic instrumentation to song ""Cicatriz ESP"" off their album De-Loused in the Comatorium. He also contributed guitar solos on their 2005 album Frances the Mute. In 2006, he helped The Mars Volta complete their third album Amputechture by playing guitar on seven of its eight tracks. In return, Rodriguez-Lopez has played on several of Frusciante's solo albums, as well as making a guest appearance on Stadium Arcadium.",fe3c399e3d5df00bf3a4af9fe51722ab,What album did Frusciante incorporate a wide array of sounds and playing styles similar to the more melodic By the Way?,Stadium Arcadium,"maximum effect.

"In mid-1920s Copenhagen, portrait artist Gerda Wegener asks her husband, popular landscape artist Einar Wegener, to stand in for a female model who is late to come to their flat to pose for a painting she's working on. The act of posing as a female figure unmasks Einar's life-long identification as a woman, who names herself Lili Elbe. This sets off a progression, first tentative and then irreversible, of leaving behind the identity as Einar, which she has struggled to maintain all her life. This takes place as both Lili and Gerda relocate to Paris; Gerda's portraits of Lili in her feminine state attract serious attention from art dealers in a way that her previous portraiture had not. It is there that Gerda tracks down art dealer Hans Axgil, a childhood friend of Lili (whom Lili had kissed when they were young). Hans and Gerda's mutual attraction is a challenge, as Gerda is navigating her changing relationship to Lili; but Hans' long-time friendship with and affection for Lili cause him to be supportive of both Lili and Gerda. As Lili's continued existence presenting as male becomes too much to bear, she starts to seek help from psychologists, but none yields any result, and, in one instance, almost leads her into being committed to an asylum. Eventually, at Hans's recommendation, Lili and Gerda meet Dr. Kurt Warnekros. Dr. Warnekros explains that he has met several people like her, who are physically male but identify as female, and proposes a new, innovative and controversial solution: male to female sex reassignment surgery. This would entail a two-part procedure that involves first removing Lili's external genitalia and then, after a period of recovery, fashioning a vagina. He warns Lili and Gerda that it is a very dangerous operation that has never been attempted before, and Lili would be one of the first to undergo it.

"In post-World War II Italy, Malvina is on her deathbed at her ancestral home. She tells Jakob, her adolescent son, that another woman will come, a woman who will love him, and that the next words he speaks will call Malvina back to him. Seven months later a British nurse specializing in children's care, Verena, arrives. Jakob hasn't spoken since his mother died and Verena is the latest English-speaking (per Malvina's wishes) nurse recruited by Klaus, Jakob's father. Verena meets estate keeper Alessio and retired house maid Lilia. Though polite, Jakob is cold and distant. Verena learns that Malvina's family owned the estate and surrounding quarries for 1,200 years. Malvina was the first descendant not to run the quarry, instead becoming a world famous pianist. Since most of the men who worked there died during the second world war, she allowed the quarry to flood, though Alessio still lights a flame for long-dead quarrymen, proclaiming ""Life. Death. Love. The stone was everything.""  When Verena looks in on Jakob one night, she finds him with his ear to the stone wall in his room, listening. Klaus fears that Jakob believes he can hear Malvina in the stone. Verena worries that she is inadequate and that Jakob's condition requires a mental health specialist. When Verena sees Jakob on the ledge of a tall tower, she endangers herself to rescue him – making her (and Jakob) realize that she cares for him and must stay to help him.  She caringly explains that the voice he hears is real, but that it is just his mind playing tricks on him. The next day Verena sees him listening to Malvina's tombstone in the family mausoleum. Alessio informs her that 40 generations are buried there ""in the stone"". Verena, who was orphaned around Jakob's age, tells the boy that she already knows that wishing to hear dead loved ones does not make it happen.",b3225f634e5753aa35c8d45acacabb8e,What is the name of Jakob's mother?,Malvina,"Verena, arrives.

"In seventeenth-century Paris, poet and supreme swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac stops a play from being shown because he ostensibly cannot stand the bombastic style of the principal actor, Montfleury. An annoyed aristocratic fop, the Vicomte de Valvert, provokes him into a duel by tritely insulting Cyrano's enormous nose. Cyrano first mocks his lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert could have phrased it (much to the amusement of the audience). He then composes a ballade for the occasion on the spot and recites it during the sword fight. With the last line, he stabs his opponent. Cyrano's friend Le Bret, Captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies of his victim's friends, but he is unconcerned. When Le Bret presses him to reveal the real reason he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor smiling at his beautiful cousin Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of it being returned because of his nose. When he receives a request from Roxane to see her in the morning, he is finally emboldened to act. Then pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau approaches him for help. Ragueneau has learned that a nobleman he had mocked with his verses, the Comte De Guiche, has hired a hundred ruffians to teach him a lesson. Cyrano escorts him, kills eight of the horde, and drives off the rest.

"In the 1960s, in an undetermined place in the Alps, an eagle couple has two hatching eggs. When both eaglets are born, their mother knows that she must only raise one as their successor. In an ensuing fight with another eagle, the eaglets' father dies when he crashes to the ground. One of the eaglets shortly falls from the nest, and his mother, due by nature to maintain the survivor, ignores the eaglet's cry for help. In the meantime, forester Danzer meets with a boy named Lukas and his father Keller. They both live in a new house in the mountains, after the death of Maria, mother of Lukas and Keller's wife, as a result of a fire. Keller, gravely afflicted by the death of his wife, fails to live in harmony and understanding with his son, who takes refuge more and more in nature, avoiding contact with his father. As a retreat Lukas constantly goes to the remains of his old house, where he often sees the photograph of his deceased mother. As Lukas' dog Scout is taking a walk in the forrest, Lukas comes across the eaglet, and Lukas decides to raise him to full health. Lukas takes the eaglet to his old house to take care of him. Danzer also meets the eaglet, and decides to help Lukas for the affection he feels for him. The forester tells Lukas that the food he has given the eaglet is not good. He also tells him to give sunlight to the eaglet. When a fox sneaks in and kills Keller's hens, he angrily chases Lukas. Lukas, fearful for the safety of the eaglet, goes to his family's hut. Lukas rescues the eaglet from the attacking foxes. As Lukas stays and reads his family's Bible, he comes across the story of Cain and Abel. Aptly fitting the eaglet's own story, Lukas names it Abel.",f625b4fdaefdce232ac76deda97f18ee,Who was married to the father of the boy that the forester meets?,Maria,"Maria, mother of Lukas and Keller's",bert,bef17d2a9bd9340caf7adb4655f6622c,Who was married to the father of the boy that the forester meets?,Maria,"Lukas and his father Keller.

"In the Puranic texts of Hinduism, Narasimha (""man-lion"") a half-lion, half-man incarnation or avatar of Vishnu, is worshipped by his devotees and saved the child devotee Prahlada from his father, the evil demon king Hiranyakashipu; Vishnu takes the form of half-man, half-lion] creature in Narasimha, where he has a human torso and lower body, and a lion-like face and claws. Singh is an ancient Indian vedic name meaning ""lion"", dating back over 2,000 years in ancient India. It was originally used only by Rajputs, a Hindu Kshatriya or military caste. After the birth of the Khalsa brotherhood in 1699, the Sikhs also adopted the name ""Singh"" due to the wishes of Guru Gobind Singh. Along with millions of Hindu Rajputs today, it is also used by over 20 million Sikhs worldwide.The Asiatic lion is found as an emblem on numerous flags and coats of arms across Asia, including on the National Emblem of India. The Asiatic lion is also symbolic for the Sinhalese, Sri Lanka's ethnic majority; the term derived from the Indo-Aryan Sinhala, meaning the ""lion people"" or ""people with lion blood"", while a sword-wielding lion is the central figure on the national flag of Sri Lanka.",bebfe3a13fd8f234b5816bd4c8ea0db1,"What means ""people with lion blood""?",Sinhalese,"Asiatic lion is also symbolic for the Sinhalese, Sri Lanka's ethnic majority; the term derived from the Indo-Aryan Sinhala,",bert,70e605fa7e0dc55b63dfd8d24e3cf7af,"What means ""lion people""?",Sinhalese,"Indo-Aryan Sinhala,",bert,2121905d9ac7bb87a395221f3cbc6a5f,Whose father is an evil demon king?,Prahlada,"Narasimha (""man-lion"") a half-lion, half-man incarnation or avatar of Vishnu,",bert,5906ab9591382935143f173f11448cba,Who has a human torso and lower body and a lion-like face and claws?,Vishnu,Hiranyakashipu; Vishnu,bert,0a7518c4cbcb7264e86a10649430cfdd,"What means ""lion people""?",Sinhalese,Asiatic lion,bert,0a096a85ffaf8e41b6fdf57e26149ae4,"What means ""lion people""?",Sinhalese,"Asiatic lion is also symbolic for the Sinhalese, Sri Lanka's ethnic majority; the term derived from the Indo-Aryan Sinhala,",bert,7601158b361aa7a5485fe1a203049169,"What means ""people with lion blood""?",Sinhalese,"Indo-Aryan Sinhala,",bert,6205e9d0ff27845d9e8bbc8764b88e77,Who has a human torso and lower body and a lion-like face and claws?,Vishnu,"Narasimha (""man-lion"") a half-lion, half-man incarnation or avatar of Vishnu,",bert,54f06b83e16e7a03d0afefa1fb841e0f,Whose father is an evil demon king?,Prahlada,"Vishnu, is worshipped by his devotees and saved the child devotee Prahlada",bert,1ff88c6cadf2fed52d3ec41c64171ea0,Whose father is an evil demon king?,Prahlada,Narasimha,bert,482e59b1d3a41945561ae92091835d5a
"In the early months of the Second World War, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine sends out merchant raiders to attack Allied shipping. The Royal Navy responds with hunting groups whose mission is to stop them. The group that finds the heavily armed pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee near South America is outgunned: Graf Spee is equipped with long-range 11-inch guns, while the British heavy cruiser Exeter has much lighter 8-inch guns, and the light cruisers Ajax and Achilles have 6-inch guns. Despite this, they go straight to the attack. The British are led by Commodore Harwood, with Captain Woodhouse commanding flagship Ajax, Captain Bell Exeter and Captain Parry Achilles. The British use their superior numbers to ""split her fire"" by attacking from different directions, but Graf Spee, under Captain Hans Langsdorff, inflicts much damage on her foes; Exeter is particularly hard hit and is forced to retire. However, Graf Spee sustains damage herself, and takes refuge in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay to make repairs. According to international law, the ship may remain at neutral harbour only long enough to make repairs for seaworthiness, not to refit her for battle.

"In the palace at Ithaca, Penelope mourns the long absence of Ulysses: ""The awaited one does not return, and the years pass by."" Her grief is echoed by her nurse, Ericlea. As Penelope leaves, her attendant Melanto enters with Eurimaco, a servant to Penelope's importunate suitors. The two sing passionately of their love for each other (""You are my sweet life""). The scene changes to the Ithacan coast, where the sleeping Ulisse is brought ashore by the Phaecians (Faeci), whose action is in defiance of the wishes of gods Giove and Nettuno. The Phaecians are punished by the gods who turn them and their ship to stone. Ulysses awakes, cursing the Phaecians for abandoning him: ""To your sails, falsest Phaeacians, may Boreas be ever hostile!"" From the goddess Minerva, who appears disguised as a shepherd boy, Ulisse learns that he is in Ithaca, and is told of ""the unchanging constancy of the chaste Penelope"", in the face of the persistent importunings of her evil suitors. Minerva promises to lead Ulisse back to the throne if he follows her advice; she tells him to disguise himself so that he can penetrate the court secretly. Ulisse goes to seek out his loyal servant Eumete, while Minerva departs to search for Telemaco, Ulisse's son who will help his father reclaim the kingdom. Back at the palace, Melanto tries vainly to persuade Penelope to choose one of the suitors: ""Why do you disdain the love of living suitors, expecting comfort from the ashes of the dead?"" In a wooded grove Eumete, banished from court by the suitors, revels in the pastoral life, despite the mockery of Iro, the suitors' parasitic follower, who sneers: ""I live among kings, you here among the herds."" After Iro is chased away, Ulisse enters disguised as a beggar, and assures Eumete that his master the king is alive, and will return. Eumete is overjoyed: ""My long sorrow will fall, vanquished by you.""",28857715a8752d1d38c947bf766402d8,What is the name of the person who tells Ulisse to disguise himself so that he can penetrate the court secretly?,Minerva,"Eumete,",bert,f0cf38bd3ea8abcc32771b528cb520ad,What are the exact names of the two individuals who sing passionately of their love for each other?,Melanto,"Melanto enters with Eurimaco,",bert,3105a15a47cb55c42e0542f980fdf07e,What is the name of the person who tells Ulisse to disguise himself so that he can penetrate the court secretly?,Minerva,Melanto,bert,fd5a08185042d18b9e66ae21839f3c8d,What is the name of the person whose attendant enters with Eurimaco?,Penelope,Ericlea.

"In the wake of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott organised the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott saw no reason to believe that his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.Amundsen concealed his revised intentions until his ship, Fram, was in the Atlantic and beyond communication. Scott was notified by telegram that a rival was in the field, but had little choice other than to continue with his own plans. Meanwhile, Fram arrived at the Ross Ice Shelf on 11 January 1911, and by 14 January had found the inlet, or ""Bay of Whales"", where Borchgrevink had made his landing eleven years earlier. This became the location of Amundsen's base camp, Framheim.After nine months' preparation, Amundsen's polar journey began on 20 October 1911. Avoiding the known route to the polar plateau via the Beardmore Glacier, Amundsen led his party of five due south, reaching the Transantarctic Mountains on 16 November. They discovered the Axel Heiberg Glacier, which provided them with a direct route to the polar plateau  and  on to the pole.  Shackleton's Farthest South mark was passed on 7 December, and the South Pole  was reached on 14 December 1911. The Norwegian party's greater skills with the techniques of ice travel, using ski and dogs, had proved decisive in their success. Captain Scott's five-man team reached the same point 33 days later, and perished during their return journey.

"In this quirky dark comedy Santiago Morales a former engineer, is unable to come to terms with the passing of his wife Viviana who has died of cancer.

He quickly becomes suicidal, obsessing over his late wife by watching videos of her on an iPad and building a shrine to her in his room.

"Interest in Monteverdi revived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among music scholars in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the Orfeo score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following the discovery of the L'incoronazione manuscript in 1888 and that of Il ritorno in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or other, during the first quarter of the 20th century: L'Orfeo in May 1911, L'incoronazione in February 1913 and Il ritorno in May 1925.The Italian nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio lauded Monteverdi and in his novel Il fuoco (1900) wrote of ""il divino Claudio ... what a heroic soul, purely Italian in its essence!"" His vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism was adopted by musicians who worked with the regime of Benito Mussolini (1922–1945), including Francesco Malipiero, Luigi Dallapiccola, and Mario Labroca, who contrasted Monteverdi with the decadence of the music of Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky.In the years after the Second World War the operas began to be performed in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 Vespers were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later.

"Iris is a shy young professional who doesn't want to rock the boat at the office where she temps. Margaret is the polar opposite, and serves as a catalyst to help Iris become more assertive. Paula eagerly awaits post-work happy hours and the chance to flirt with attractive men. Jane (Ubach) is engaged to marry a jerk who is already cheating on her. Margaret hopes to become a permanent employee as an assistant to Mr. Lasky, but her dreams are thwarted when he suddenly dies. The four temps form a camaraderie which assists them in getting through their boring and tedious days at work. A series of thefts occur in the office and suspicion falls on the temps, particularly Margaret. When Iris finds a plastic monkey inside Margaret's desk that she had thought was stolen, Iris loses faith in Margaret and believes that she is the office thief. Margaret suggests a one-day strike from work due to mistreatment and being under appreciated as temps, and her friends halfheartedly agree to join her, but on the appointed day Margaret is the only one who does not come to work. As a result, the company's officious head of human resources fires Margaret, and management micromanages the remaining three temps. Iris, Paula and Jane's friendship comes to an end as result of the stress, ending the camaraderie among the temporary workers, and eventually they all go their separate ways. Paula is upset when she learns of Jane's wedding from a newspaper announcement, to which she was not invited, and leaves to work in another department. It is later discovered that another employee (a rich girl who was hired as a permanent employee after her first day) was the thief and that Margaret simply had a similar toy in her desk. Iris confronts the thief when her diary disappears; Iris later receives a new diary and note of apology.",3ad64ea2ccabde068b634afbfce91281,Who does Iris confront when her diary disappears?,a rich girl who was hired as a permanent employee,Margaret simply had a similar toy in her desk.

"It is the Florida Everglades in 1863. Four deserters of the Confederate Army—Sergeant Todd, Plunkett, Cockney and the Kid—are hiding out. The Colonel, a fellow deserter, appears from the brush with a note from an Indian who has arranged to take him to the ocean so he may be taken to Cuba. When the Indian guide is found dead by Seminoles, the foursome reluctantly join forces with the Colonel in order to reach the coast and ride out the rest of the Civil War. As the group treks through the dangerous Florida everglades, it's revealed that Plunkett has stolen a large amount of gold from the Confederate army, which Cockney wants to steal from him. The group continues its trek, and it is revealed Cockney is drop-dead afraid of snakes, and being in close contact with them sends him into a paralyzed state. Cockney also reveals that the Colonel deserted after giving drunk orders during the Battle of Murfreesboro, leading to a slaughter. A drought ensues, and when the group reaches water, they also find two dead fellow deserters, killed by Seminoles. The Colonel wishes to bury them, but the foursome disagrees, citing the danger of nearby Seminoles. However, the Kid changes their minds. Soon after, the Colonel begins experiencing troubles, getting a fever, and hallucinating.

"It is winter time and Krazy is in his horse-drawn sleigh, running through the snowy outdoors. Next, he stops over at the house of his spaniel girlfriend. Krazy then calls and invites her to go out with him. Showing herself through a window, the spaniel discloses she cannot come outside because her door is blocked by thick snow. In this, Krazy and his horse goes on to clear the doorway. In just a short while, the impeding snow has been removed, and the spaniel finally steps out. They then head off in the sleigh. Krazy and the spaniel arrive at their destination, the frozen lake. They then put on their ice skates and set foot on the ice. For several moments, things are going very smooth for them. Their movements are fluent and they never stumble into things. This is until Krazy crashes into a wooden barrel and starts to lose control. He then overshoots the edge of the lake and gets himself into a snowy slope. As he tumbles down the slope, Krazy becomes covered in snow and immediately becomes a large rampaging snowball. The snowball bashes a cabin and rolls into a barn where it runs over the farm animals. Finally, it spatters onto a larger house, and Krazy is free at last. Just nearby him is the spaniel who is relieved to know he is unharmed. Without further ado, they continue looking for ways to spend time in the frosty landscape.",012c4d1b4fce90e5401779639a71ee54,Who are the two that head off in the sleigh?,Krazy,the spaniel finally steps out.

"James Weddell was an Anglo-Scottish seaman who saw service in both the Royal Navy and the merchant marine before undertaking his first voyages to Antarctic waters. In 1819, in command of the 160-ton brigantine Jane which had been adapted for whaling, he set sail for the newly discovered whaling grounds of the South Sandwich Islands. His chief interest on this voyage was in finding the ""Aurora Islands"", which had been reported at 53°S, 48°W by the Spanish ship Aurora in 1762.  He failed to discover this non-existent land, but his sealing activities showed a handsome profit. In 1822 Weddell, again in command of Jane and this time accompanied by the smaller ship Beaufort, set sail for the south with instructions from his employers that, should the sealing prove barren, he was to ""investigate beyond the track of former navigators"". This suited Weddell's exploring instincts, and he equipped his vessel with chronometers, thermometers, compasses, barometers and charts. In January 1823 he probed the waters between the South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkney Islands, looking for new land. Finding none, he turned southward down the 40°W meridian, deep into the sea that now bears his name. The season was unusually calm, and Weddell reported that ""not a particle of ice of any description was to be seen"". On 20 February 1823, he reached a new Farthest South of 74°15'S, three degrees beyond Cook's former record.  Unaware that he was close to land, Weddell decided to return northward from this point, convinced that the sea continued as far as the South Pole. Another two days' sailing would likely have brought him within sight of Coats Land, which was not discovered until 1904, by William Speirs Bruce during the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, 1902–04. On his return to England, Weddell's claim to have exceeded Cook's record by such a margin ""caused some raised eyebrows"", but was soon accepted.",8ef71a8b5b7273ea8f0ab2dbf4edf760,What is the last name of the person whose chief interest was finding the Aurora Islands?,Weddell,"Cook's former record.

"Jerry, a secret agent, drives a micro dragster through the street of a town (the buildings in the opening shot suggest Westminster, London) and enters his secret headquarters through a cigar store Indian. His mission is to infiltrate the mansion of Tom Thrush and recover a refrigerator with a large amount of cheese. Before taking the operation out, he checks all of the weapons inside his coat. But when he shows his weapons, they fire, creating several holes on the coat as he comically grins at the ""audience"". After the opening credits, Tom (notably with a gap in his teeth in this cartoon) sets some traps for Jerry, including an exploding robot female mouse, as he drives to Tom's mansion, outside of the city. These prove mostly ineffective at stopping Jerry. Tom manages to reach the safeguarded room and sets even more traps, such as mines, blades, cannons, and barbed wire. Jerry plays a tape-recorder; it sounds as if he is walking through the room. Tom waits a few seconds, then says ""Boom!"" Not hearing the explosions that should result from the walking, Tom runs  in and gets attacked by his own traps as a result. After that, Tom ""helps"" Jerry by opening the safe that keeps the refrigerator as he has lost his sanity and self-control (due to the traps that he ran over). Jerry thanks Tom by lifting his fedora up as he now has the refrigerator. Jerry straps the refrigerator to his micro dragster and Tom crawls out the front door, in a very bad way following the incident.

"Jerry, a secret agent, drives a micro dragster through the street of a town (the buildings in the opening shot suggest Westminster, London) and enters his secret headquarters through a cigar store Indian.

"Johann Sebastian Bach composed the secular cantata Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht (Time, which day and year doth make), BWV 134.1, BWV 134a, while he was in the service of the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. Bach wrote the work as a  serenata for the celebration of New Year's Day 1719. The libretto by Christian Friedrich Hunold, an academic at the University of Halle, takes the form of a dialogue between two allegorical figures, Time and Divine Providence, representing the past and future, respectively. Bach set the words in eight movements consisting of alternating recitatives and arias, culminating in a choral finale. Most movements are duets of solo voices, an alto as Divine Providence and a tenor as Time. Even the closing movement features long duet passages, leading to parts for four voices. The singers are supported by a baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes, two violins, viola and continuo. The character of the music is close to baroque opera, including French dances. Later, in Leipzig, Bach used the secular cantata as the basis for a church cantata for the Third Day of Easter 1724, Ein Herz, das seinen Jesum lebend weiß. In the initial version of the Easter cantata, he made no changes to the 1719 music other than to omit two movements and replace the text with words for the occasion, written by an unknown author.

"Johann Sebastian Bach composed the secular cantata Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht (Time, which day and year doth make), BWV 134.1, BWV 134a, while he was in the service of the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. Bach wrote the work as a  serenata for the celebration of New Year's Day 1719. The libretto by Christian Friedrich Hunold, an academic at the University of Halle, takes the form of a dialogue between two allegorical figures, Time and Divine Providence, representing the past and future, respectively. Bach set the words in eight movements consisting of alternating recitatives and arias, culminating in a choral finale. Most movements are duets of solo voices, an alto as Divine Providence and a tenor as Time. Even the closing movement features long duet passages, leading to parts for four voices. The singers are supported by a baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes, two violins, viola and continuo. The character of the music is close to baroque opera, including French dances. Later, in Leipzig, Bach used the secular cantata as the basis for a church cantata for the Third Day of Easter 1724, Ein Herz, das seinen Jesum lebend weiß. In the initial version of the Easter cantata, he made no changes to the 1719 music other than to omit two movements and replace the text with words for the occasion, written by an unknown author.

"King Kung Fu tells the story of a good-humored, hat-loving, Chinese talking gorilla originally named Jungle Jumper who has been taught karate. After beating up his Kung Fu Master owner, Alfunku, when the latter dared him to snatch a banana from his hand, he is shipped off to the U.S. as a ""goodwill gift"" by his battered and embarrassed teacher, where he is renamed King Kung Fu for publicity purposes. On the way to the New York Zoo, the ""Monster Master of the Martial Arts"" is put on display in Wichita, Kansas, where two out-of-work reporters set him free with plans to ""capture"" him and get jobs.

"Marojejy National Park is located in the northeast of Madagascar between the towns of Andapa and Sambava and extends approximately 32 km (20 mi) from east to west and 22 km (14 mi) from north to south.  It is centered on the chain of mountains known as Marojejy Massif.  Despite a scientific survey of some of the other mountains in the region by the 1929 Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Américaine, Marojejy was not surveyed until 1937 when L.-J. Arragon of the Service Géographique de Madagascar ascended Marojejy Est. Arragon did not conduct any field research during his visit.  The massif was not geologically described until after the French botanist Jean-Henri Humbert from the National Museum of Natural History in Paris explored the mountains in 1948.  Humbert had previously explored numerous mountain ranges in continental Africa before going to Marojejy. Between November 1948 and November 1950, he spent five months collecting 4,039 dried plant (herbarium) specimens for study.  After several expeditions, he published the book ""A Marvel of Nature"" in 1955, in which he claimed the massif was the most impressive range in all of Madagascar because of its size, floral diversity, and pristine natural state.Marojejy was set aside as one of Madagascar's strict nature reserves in 1952 largely due to Humbert's enthusiasm and support.  Under this protection, only research scientists were permitted to visit the site.  In 1998, Marojejy was converted into a national park and thus became open to visitors.Originally seen as a transition zone between the eastern rainforests and the central highlands, Marojejy is now recognized as having its own unique features, with some of the richest biodiversity on the island.  Several studies from the early 1970s through the 1990s surveyed the mountain ecosystems and inventoried the flora and fauna.  In 2007, Marojejy was listed as a World Heritage Site as part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana. Due to illegal logging and trafficking of valuable hardwoods, and especially after the 2009 political crisis in Madagascar, the Rainforests of the Atsinanana was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 2010.",b1557e6f29c61b116936afff83fa04f0,What list was the site that was added as a World Heritage Site in 2007 added to in 2010?,World Heritage in Danger,of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana.,bert,865141076c2106e1ccc0ffabe7b755c8,In what year was the park that is between Andapa and Sambava converted to a national park?,1998,2007,bert,98d3860e17a99724f2c9367604a14ed6,In what year was the park that is between Andapa and Sambava converted to a national park?,1998,2010,bert,1d6969e2db95b1e677713e4b5164a87f,In what year was the park that is between Andapa and Sambava converted to a national park?,1998,"2009 political crisis in Madagascar, the Rainforests of the Atsinanana was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 2010.",bert,e7aa8f0850072cbcc77ee8839c5d47a3,What is the name of the location that the park in northeast Madagascar is a part of in terms of being a World Heritage Site?,Rainforests of the Atsinanana,state.Marojejy,bert,4ac627a1222427e766494c34a7226891,What is the name of the location that the park in northeast Madagascar is a part of in terms of being a World Heritage Site?,Rainforests of the Atsinanana,Marojejy National Park,bert,7d4430e2c526a59213d784174e721b18,What list was the site that was added as a World Heritage Site in 2007 added to in 2010?,World Heritage in Danger,list of World Heritage in Danger,bert,95b5d2924cf854a7a8d5ce2f4069ca35,What year was the park that surveyed in 1937 set aside as a nature reserve?,1952,1955,bert,0113bfe0565db5240e7a4123f6331efd,What year was the park that surveyed in 1937 set aside as a nature reserve?,1952,1970s through the 1990s,bert,88e51b7dd0a1fc9b0fdd524b0e671313,In what year was the park that is between Andapa and Sambava converted to a national park?,1998,"1952 largely due to Humbert's enthusiasm and support.

"Max Anderson is being pursued by a Tyrannosaurus until a fissure vent opens in the ground. When he tries to jump across, he calls out his brother's name before falling into the vent. Ten years later, Max's 13-year-old son, Sean Anderson, visits Max's brother, volcanologist Trevor Anderson. In a box of items that belonged to Max is a book, Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. Notes written by Max are found inside the book. In Trevor's volcanology laboratory, a device shows activity on Snæfell, a dormant volcano in Iceland. Trevor and Sean travel to Iceland to investigate. They try to contact Icelandic volcanologist Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, but instead encounter his daughter Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir since her father had died some years earlier. It turns out that Sigurbjörn and Max were both Vernians, a group of people who believe the works of Jules Verne to be fact and not fiction. Hannah offers to help them climb the volcano. While the group is hiking up the volcano, a lightning storm forces them to take shelter in a cave. The cave entrance collapses, trapping them in what appears to be an abandoned mine. The trio rappel down a giant hole and ride on out-of-control mine carts, in which the tracks start to branch off in three ways. Hannah and Trevor save each other from dead-ends and Sean reunites with them. They reach the bottom of a volcanic vent filled with different varieties of crystals, including Diamonds. Sean accidentally drops a diamond, which breaks the Muscovite floor, and they begin to fall towards the center of the Earth. The vent eventually becomes a water slide which drops them safely into a lake in the center of the Earth, which turns out to be a completely separate world contained within the Earth.",d81578538c11f1b5facbbb604101a198,What are the full names of the people who rappel down a hole in the mine?,Hannah Ásgeirsdóttir,"Trevor Anderson.

"Melanie Daniels, a young socialite, meets criminal defense attorney Mitch Brenner in a San Francisco pet shop. Mitch wants to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his sister's eleventh birthday, but the shop has none. He recognizes Melanie from a court appearance, but she does not know him; he plays a prank by pretending to mistake her for a saleswoman. Melanie is infuriated by the prank—but finds herself romantically intrigued by Mitch. Melanie purchases a pair of lovebirds and drives to Mitch's weekend address in Bodega Bay to deliver them. Wanting to surprise him, she rents a motorboat so she can approach the Brenner house from the bay instead of the road. She sneaks the birds inside the house and heads back across the bay. Mitch discovers the birds, spots Melanie's boat during her retreat, and drives around the bay to meet her. Melanie is attacked and injured by a seagull near shore on the town side. Mitch treats her abrasion and invites her to dinner; she hesitantly agrees. Melanie gets to know Mitch, his domineering mother Lydia, and his younger sister Cathy.

"Melanie Daniels, a young socialite, meets criminal defense attorney Mitch Brenner in a San Francisco pet shop. Mitch wants to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his sister's eleventh birthday, but the shop has none. He recognizes Melanie from a court appearance, but she does not know him; he plays a prank by pretending to mistake her for a saleswoman. Melanie is infuriated by the prank—but finds herself romantically intrigued by Mitch. Melanie purchases a pair of lovebirds and drives to Mitch's weekend address in Bodega Bay to deliver them. Wanting to surprise him, she rents a motorboat so she can approach the Brenner house from the bay instead of the road. She sneaks the birds inside the house and heads back across the bay. Mitch discovers the birds, spots Melanie's boat during her retreat, and drives around the bay to meet her. Melanie is attacked and injured by a seagull near shore on the town side. Mitch treats her abrasion and invites her to dinner; she hesitantly agrees. Melanie gets to know Mitch, his domineering mother Lydia, and his younger sister Cathy. She also befriends local school teacher Annie Hayworth, Mitch's ex-lover. While spending the night at Annie's house, she and Annie are startled by a loud thud: a gull kills itself by flying into the front door.

"Mineralogist Paul Carlson is struck by a lunar meteorite while observing a meteor shower.  Lodged in his brain, the meteorite causes him to transform into a strong and vicious lizard (the titular ""moon beast"") whenever the moon comes out. In his lizard form, Paul loses all traces of his human self and goes about killing people at random. While human, Paul is subject to spells of dizziness and nausea, causing his girlfriend Kathy Nolan and friend and former teacher Johnny Longbow to become concerned.

"Minerva and Telemaco return to Ithaca in a chariot. Telemaco is greeted joyfully by Eumete and the disguised Ulisse in the woodland grove: ""O great son of Ulysses, you have indeed returned!"" After Eumete goes to inform Penelope of Telemaco's arrival a bolt of fire descends on Ulisse, removing his disguise and revealing his true identity to his son. The two celebrate their reunion before Ulisse sends Telemaco to the palace, promising to follow shortly. In the palace, Melanto complains to Eurimaco that Penelope still refuses to choose a suitor: ""In short, Eurymachus, the lady has a heart of stone."" Soon afterwards Penelope receives the three suitors (Antinoo, Pisandro, Anfinomo), and rejects each in turn despite their efforts to enliven the court with singing and dancing: ""Now to enjoyment, to dance and song!"" After the suitors' departure Eumete tells Penelope that Telemaco has arrived in Ithaca, but she is doubtful: ""Such uncertain things redouble my grief."" Eumete's message is overheard by the suitors, who plot to kill Telemaco. However, they are unnerved when a symbolic eagle flies overhead, so they abandon their plan and renew their efforts to capture Penelope's heart, this time with gold. Back in the woodland grove, Minerva tells Ulisse that she has organised a means whereby he will be able to challenge and destroy the suitors. Resuming his beggar's disguise, Ulisse arrives at the palace, where he is challenged to a fight by Iro, (""I will pluck out the hairs of your beard one by one!""), a challenge he accepts and wins. Penelope now states that she will accept the suitor who is able to string Ulisse's bow. All three suitors attempt the task unsuccessfully. The disguised Ulisse then asks to try though renouncing the prize of Penelope's hand, and to everyone's amazement he succeeds.

"Minnesota ""Doc"" West is sending money (each bill marked with an ""E"") to a  boarding school in Boston in a post office at Santa Fe, New Mexico. After leaving the post  office he is robbed by two bandits who take everything, including his money. He rides after them on his horse, but is stopped when he sees a boy named Silver fall  off his horse spooked by a rattlesnake. West shoots the rattlesnake's rattler off and it  retreats into the bushes.  Silver's arm is dislocated, but West fixes it. Silver asks him if  he's a doctor, but West declines. Silver tells West that the bandits headed for Holysand, the nearest town. When they arrive  in Holysand, they discover a fire in the middle of town set by Silver's stepfather and rancher, Nathan Mitchell. Nathan argues with a rival rancher, Victor Baker about burning the bags of seed that Nathan bought. The argument is broken up by Sheriff Roy Basehart and the local school teacher Denise Stark. Nathan's ranch hand, Garvey orders Silver to clean it up. West walks into the saloon turning everyone's head, because he is new. Instead of ordering  whiskey he orders tea, causing everyone to ridicule him. Garvey offers him a seat and a round  of poker. West wins a hand, but Garvey accuses him of cheating.

"Minnesota ""Doc"" West is sending money (each bill marked with an ""E"") to a  boarding school in Boston in a post office at Santa Fe, New Mexico. After leaving the post  office he is robbed by two bandits who take everything, including his money. He rides after them on his horse, but is stopped when he sees a boy named Silver fall  off his horse spooked by a rattlesnake. West shoots the rattlesnake's rattler off and it  retreats into the bushes.  Silver's arm is dislocated, but West fixes it. Silver asks him if  he's a doctor, but West declines. Silver tells West that the bandits headed for Holysand, the nearest town. When they arrive  in Holysand, they discover a fire in the middle of town set by Silver's stepfather and rancher, Nathan Mitchell. Nathan argues with a rival rancher, Victor Baker about burning the bags of seed that Nathan bought. The argument is broken up by Sheriff Roy Basehart and the local school teacher Denise Stark. Nathan's ranch hand, Garvey orders Silver to clean it up. West walks into the saloon turning everyone's head, because he is new. Instead of ordering  whiskey he orders tea, causing everyone to ridicule him. Garvey offers him a seat and a round  of poker. West wins a hand, but Garvey accuses him of cheating. The sheriff arrests West and  locks him up and Garvey keeps West's money. Later that night Silver tells people about how West  fixed his arm.

"New York City bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga is searching for new employment while the Copacabana nightclub, where he works, is closed for renovations. He is invited to an interview with Doctor Don Shirley, an eccentric African American pianist who is looking for a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South. Don hires Tony on the strength of his references. They embark with plans to return to New York on Christmas Eve. Don's record label gives Tony a copy of the Green Book, a guide for African-American travelers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve them.They begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading farther south. Tony and Don initially clash as  Don is disgusted by Tony's habits while Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act with more refinement. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, and increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment that Don receives from his hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. A group of white men threatens Don's life in a bar and Tony rescues him. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour.",1138d231ba3b95416a2d316a769d5aa0,What is the alias of the person who drives Don on his concert tour?,"""Tony Lip""","""Tony",bert,bdacb105d683ed80efc6daa8f848f1e2,What is the last name of the person who Tony rescues?,Shirley,Vallelonga,bert,750e01dcea7ee37b48ce974af84d557d,What is the last name of the person who Tony rescues?,Shirley,Don's life in a bar and Tony rescues him.

"Novelists and writers have captured much of the color and challenge in their immigrant lives through their writings.Regarding Irish women in the 19th century, there were numerous novels and short stories by Harvey O'Higgins, Peter McCorry, Bernard O'Reilly and Sarah Orne Jewett that emphasize emancipation from Old World controls, new opportunities and expansiveness of the immigrant experience.On the other hand, Hladnik studies three popular novels of the late 19th century that warned Slovenes not to immigrate to the dangerous new world of the United States.Jewish American writer Anzia Yezierska wrote her novel Bread Givers (1925) to explore such themes as Russian-Jewish immigration in the early 20th century, the tension between Old and New World Yiddish culture, and women's experience of immigration. A well established author Yezierska focused on the Jewish struggle to escape the ghetto and enter middle- and upper-class America. In the novel, the heroine, Sara Smolinsky, escape from New York City's ""down-town ghetto"" by breaking tradition. She quits her job at the family store and soon becomes engaged to a rich real-estate magnate. She graduates college and takes a high-prestige job teaching public school. Finally Sara restores her broken links to family and religion.The Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg in the mid-20th century wrote a series of four novels describing one Swedish family's migration from Småland to Minnesota in the late 19th century, a destiny shared by almost one million people. The author emphasizes the authenticity of the experiences as depicted (although he did change names).

"Novelists and writers have captured much of the color and challenge in their immigrant lives through their writings.Regarding Irish women in the 19th century, there were numerous novels and short stories by Harvey O'Higgins, Peter McCorry, Bernard O'Reilly and Sarah Orne Jewett that emphasize emancipation from Old World controls, new opportunities and expansiveness of the immigrant experience.On the other hand, Hladnik studies three popular novels of the late 19th century that warned Slovenes not to immigrate to the dangerous new world of the United States.Jewish American writer Anzia Yezierska wrote her novel Bread Givers (1925) to explore such themes as Russian-Jewish immigration in the early 20th century, the tension between Old and New World Yiddish culture, and women's experience of immigration.

In the novel, the heroine, Sara Smolinsky, escape from New York City's ""down-town ghetto"" by breaking tradition.

"Nurse Laura Mattson and World War I military pilot Lt. Geoffrey Aiken fall in love after only knowing each other for a few days. Tragically, he is brought to her hospital and, by chance, put under her care after being fatally wounded on his very first mission. After he dies, Laura realizes she is pregnant. Edward Seward loves her and persuades her to marry him. As far as anyone knows, the child will be his. By 1940, Laura's son Bob has grown into a young man, newly engaged to Peggy Chase. Laura has raised Bob to embrace pacifism. Meanwhile, Edward Seward, now United States Secretary of State, flies home after having negotiated the Seward Peace Treaty, which he claims will make it impossible for any country to go to war again. However, when the U.S. ambassador to the state of ""Eurasia"" is assassinated while en route to the Eurasian State Department to discuss an earlier diplomatic incident, the President sends the navy across the Atlantic to underscore the U.S. demand for a formal apology. Eurasia refuses to comply, and another world war becomes inevitable despite the treaty. Laura speaks at a large peace rally, over her husband's strong objection. The rally is broken up a group of angry men. A mob then gathers at the Seward home and starts pelting the place. Edward manages to disperse the crowd by first reminding the mob of each American's right to voice his or her own opinion in peacetime, and pledging himself wholeheartedly to the struggle once war is declared. When a news reporter interviews him, he insists his son will enlist. Bob categorically denies this, causing Peggy to break off their engagement. Unable to get his son to change his mind, Edward tells him that he at least has no right to sully the Seward name, revealing that he is not Bob's father.

"Okereke has discussed a natural progression in Bloc Party's compositional style to a more explorative, electronic direction. For the opening track on Intimacy, ""Ares"", Okereke was inspired to rap his lyrics after listening to the old-school hip hop of Afrika Bambaataa. According to Heather Phares of AllMusic, the song includes siren-like guitar chords and loud, complex drumming in the vein of dance acts The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. ""Mercury"" continues the complex drumming theme by incorporating layered percussion and contains a vocally manipulated chorus. The track is an attempt at drum and bass and features brass dissonance, effects Okereke has called ""harsh, glacial, layered and energetic"". ""Zephyrus"" begins with a solitary vocal line accompanied only by a drum machine pattern, while the Exmoor Singers provide background vocals in the rest of the composition. ""Signs"" is the only song that does not include guitars; instead, it is made up of a synthesiser pulse and multitracked samples of glockenspiel and mbira resembling the work of minimalist composer Steve Reich.Okereke has conceded that Intimacy covers Bloc Party's typical indie rock elements, but noted that the guitars have an artificial and manipulated sound, ""almost like all the humanity has been bleached out"". ""Halo"" has a fast tempo coupled with a guitar melody that uses only four chords, while ""Trojan Horse"" features syncopated guitars and distortion. ""Talons"" also incorporates distortion from both lead and rhythm guitars, while the final single ""One Month Off"" consists of tribal rhythms and sixteenth note guitar riffs. ""Biko"" has a slower tempo and includes guitar arpeggi throughout, while ""Ion Square"" incorporates guitar overdubbing and the use of hi-hat patterns throughout. According to Nick Southall of Drowned in Sound, ""Better Than Heaven"" encapsulates what Bloc Party had been trying to achieve in their previous works, ""namely aligning all their different directional desires: to swoon, to rock, and to experiment all at once"".

"On Christmas Eve in 19th-century London, Fred is sliding on ice on a sidewalk. He meets Peter and Tim Cratchit, sons of his uncle Ebenezer's clerk, Bob Cratchit. When Fred reveals who he is, the boys take off in terror. Fred soon arrives at the counting-house of his miserly maternal uncle, Ebenezer Scrooge. After declining an invitation from his nephew to dine with him on Christmas, Scrooge rejects two gentlemen collecting money for charity. That night, Scrooge reluctantly allows his employee Bob Cratchit to have Christmas off with pay but orders him back all the earlier the day after. Later Bob accidentally knocks off Scrooge's hat with a snowball. Scrooge dismisses Bob and withholds a week's pay to compensate for his ruined hat, also demanding a shilling to make up the difference. Bob spends the last of his wages on food for his family's Christmas dinner.  In his house, Scrooge is confronted by the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns Scrooge to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife as Marley was. He tells Scrooge he will be haunted by three spirits. At one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the youthful Ghost of Christmas Past, who takes him back in time to his early life. Scrooge is shown his unhappiness when he was left to spend the holidays alone at school, and his joy when his sister, Fran, came to take him home for Christmas. The spirit reminds Scrooge that Fran, dead for some years, is the mother of his nephew.

"On New Year's Eve 1938, lawyer Billy Cooper notices stranded English showgirl Jennie Carr gazing hungrily at other diners' plates and offers to buy her a meal. However, the restaurant is all out of food, so he invites her to his apartment. Before they arrive, Abel, another equally hungry and unemployed person, sneaks in for a chicken leg. Hearing them coming, he hides in a bedroom. When Jennie enters the room to remove her coat, he begs her not to cause trouble. She sympathizes with his plight and says nothing to Billy. Just then, Hugo Brant, Billy's gangster employer, and his men barge in. They make Jennie leave. When Billy admits that he is quitting, Brant shoots him dead. To get rid of loose ends, Hugo sends Harrigan aboard the ocean liner bound for Southampton with Jennie. He frames Jennie for robbery. Meanwhile, Abel, who was caught by the building watchman as he tried to sneak out, is tried and sentenced to death for Cooper's murder. The woman he insists can exonerate him is in HM Prison Holloway, unaware of his plight. Hugo and gang member Mortimer travel to England to deal with Jennie.

"On his release, Tippett returned to his duties at Morley, where he boosted the college's Purcell tradition by persuading Alfred Deller, the countertenor, to sing several Purcell odes at a  concert on 21 October 1944—the first modern use of a countertenor  in Purcell's music. Tippett formed a fruitful musical friendship with Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears, for whom he wrote the cantata Boyhood's End for tenor and piano. Encouraged by Britten, Tippett made arrangements for the first performance of A Child of Our Time, at London's Adelphi Theatre on 19 March 1944. Goehr conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Morley's choral forces were augmented by the London Regional Civil Defence Choir. Pears sang the tenor solo part, and other soloists were borrowed from Sadler's Wells Opera. The work was well received by critics and the public, and eventually became one of the most frequently performed large-scale choral works of the post-Second World War period, in Britain and overseas. Tippett's immediate reward was a commission from the BBC for a motet, The Weeping Babe, which became his first broadcast work when it was aired on 24 December 1944. He also began to give regular radio talks on music.In 1946 Tippett organised at Morley the first British performance of Monteverdi's Vespers, adding his own organ Preludio for the occasion. Tippett's compositions in the immediate postwar years included his  First Symphony, performed under Sargent in November 1945, and the String Quartet No. 3, premiered in October 1946 by the Zorian Quartet.

"On his release, Tippett returned to his duties at Morley, where he boosted the college's Purcell tradition by persuading Alfred Deller, the countertenor, to sing several Purcell odes at a  concert on 21 October 1944—the first modern use of a countertenor  in Purcell's music. Tippett formed a fruitful musical friendship with Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears, for whom he wrote the cantata Boyhood's End for tenor and piano. Encouraged by Britten, Tippett made arrangements for the first performance of A Child of Our Time, at London's Adelphi Theatre on 19 March 1944. Goehr conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Morley's choral forces were augmented by the London Regional Civil Defence Choir. Pears sang the tenor solo part, and other soloists were borrowed from Sadler's Wells Opera. The work was well received by critics and the public, and eventually became one of the most frequently performed large-scale choral works of the post-Second World War period, in Britain and overseas. Tippett's immediate reward was a commission from the BBC for a motet, The Weeping Babe, which became his first broadcast work when it was aired on 24 December 1944. He also began to give regular radio talks on music.In 1946 Tippett organised at Morley the first British performance of Monteverdi's Vespers, adding his own organ Preludio for the occasion. Tippett's compositions in the immediate postwar years included his  First Symphony, performed under Sargent in November 1945, and the String Quartet No. 3, premiered in October 1946 by the Zorian Quartet.

"On the eve of the first day of school, Brady and McKenzie celebrate the day they met and reminisce about the summer, while they watch Brady's favorite movie, Wet Side Story, the 1960s musical film that they got stuck in during the events of Teen Beach Movie. Mack dismisses Brady's fear that their relationship will change when they begin school. Mack then notices she lost the necklace she received while in Wet Side Story's universe. At school, Brady and Mack reunite with their respective friends, Devon and Alyssa, who are surprised by their new relationship due to their opposite personalities. Brady and Mack are surprised by how differently they act at school. Later, in class, Brady is working on surfboard designs, but hides them when Mack asks him what he is doing. Brady becomes defensive when Mack meets a handsome boy named Spencer Watkins. Mack works on a ""Save The Beach"" dance, despite Brady's attempts to see her. Struggling with a college application, Brady works on a surfboard instead and accidentally forgets about a college fair that he was to attend with Mack, upsetting her to the point that they break up. In the Wet Side Story universe, Lela and Tanner notice Mack's washed-up necklace and journey into the ocean, winding up on the same beach as Mack and Brady, who are still mad at each other. Mack and Brady tell Lela and Tanner that they are in the future, exciting them. Mack and Brady do not tell them they are film characters, choosing instead to show them that the real world is not as great as it seems, in hopes that they will return to their own world. Meanwhile, the characters in Wet Side Story are confused without Lela and Tanner.",8b9d981fe33d5e852d8197f89c54a0e1,What is McKenzie's nickname?,Mack,Brady,bert,ca087256d205118b127c737a3411f519,What is McKenzie's nickname?,Mack,Spencer Watkins.

"One day, Molly Standing is picking apples in her father's apple orchard in California, with her friend Gertie, when they meet two boys, Tommy Melville and Gus Schultz. Molly falls in love with Tommy while Gertie falls in love with Gus. They plan a double wedding. Gerald Winters and his mother, who are wealthy art patrons, hear Molly singing, and, at Gerald's suggestion, since he is very attracted to her, they sponsor her to study in Italy. Molly is reluctant to go but finally accepts when she discovers her father is in need of money. She leaves on the day that Tommy had hoped would be their wedding day. He says goodbye to her before attending Gertie and Gus's wedding ceremony. Molly becomes a success in Rome. She returns to the United States to sing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, where she is again a great success. After the performance, Tommy attends the party which has been given by Gerald and his mother. Molly asks Tommy to sing, but her society friends do not think much of his singing. Realizing that Molly now lives in a world far apart from his, Tommy breaks off his engagement and returns to the orchards. Molly stays in New York for two years and then moves on to San Francisco for a concert stop. Although she is supposed to marry Gerald soon, she is unhappy. She goes to her father's orchards to visit her old friend Gertie, to see how things are going with her. She happens to run into Tommy, and they rekindle their love and are married.

"One day, Molly Standing is picking apples in her father's apple orchard in California, with her friend Gertie, when they meet two boys, Tommy Melville and Gus Schultz. Molly falls in love with Tommy while Gertie falls in love with Gus. They plan a double wedding. Gerald Winters and his mother, who are wealthy art patrons, hear Molly singing, and, at Gerald's suggestion, since he is very attracted to her, they sponsor her to study in Italy. Molly is reluctant to go but finally accepts when she discovers her father is in need of money. She leaves on the day that Tommy had hoped would be their wedding day. He says goodbye to her before attending Gertie and Gus's wedding ceremony. Molly becomes a success in Rome. She returns to the United States to sing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, where she is again a great success. After the performance, Tommy attends the party which has been given by Gerald and his mother. Molly asks Tommy to sing, but her society friends do not think much of his singing. Realizing that Molly now lives in a world far apart from his, Tommy breaks off his engagement and returns to the orchards. Molly stays in New York for two years and then moves on to San Francisco for a concert stop. Although she is supposed to marry Gerald soon, she is unhappy. She goes to her father's orchards to visit her old friend Gertie, to see how things are going with her. She happens to run into Tommy, and they rekindle their love and are married. Before they leave on their honeymoon, the doctor informs Molly's manager and Tommy that Schilling has lost her voice and will never sing again, except perhaps, a lullaby.",aae3d057840d6f6ba3e008c83732d613,What is the full name of the person whose singing is not thought very much of?,Tommy Melville,Tommy Melville and Gus Schultz.

"Overall, reception of the album was positive. Stephen Holden of Blender called Wainwright's tribute ""a fabulous stunt in which a gay singer channeled the spirit of the ultimate gay icon"", and declared the album was ""as good an introduction to the great American songbook as any"". Pitchfork Media's Stephen Troussé wrote that Wainwright ""elegantly outdoes [Garland] on a couple of the ballads"" and also compliments guest performer Martha Wainwright, ""who turns in a stunning, showstopping 'Stormy Weather' in an appropriately brazen bid to steal the show"". In his review for Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau stated it was ""a relief to hear him essay the show tunes and Tin Pan Alley chestnuts of this tribute album"". Furthermore, he wrote that the songs ""expand [Wainwright's] melodic compass"", allowing him to ""bring something new to them too – namely, sexuality in the sensuality as opposed to gender-preference sense"". Dave Hughes of Slant Magazine had positive comments about the album: ""That Wainwright has the temerity to cover such a bona fide classic—and the chops to pull it off without breaking a limb or his brain—speaks both to his ambition and to his prodigious abilities.""The album did receive some criticism. After noting Garland's lifelong attempt to master pitch and articulation, Christgau claimed Wainwright's habit of ""slid[ing] past notes and draw[ing] out the final syllables of lines are signatures indistinguishable from tics"". Entertainment Weekly's Chris Willman wrote that Wainwright's ""delicate upper range is nicely attuned to some of the ballads, but anything that requires belting is pretty much a loss"". Mark Edwards of The Times called Wainwright's performance an acquired taste, stating his ""trademark delivery"" is ""lazy and somewhat slurred"". Dave Hughes' review pointed out Wainwright's ""problem with the brassy high notes in an otherwise energetic take on 'That's Entertainment'"", but admits it would be unfair to hold this against him since Garland's live performance was not perfect either.

"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah, was a flautist and composer of traditional music of the central highlands of Madagascar. Born in 1923 near the capital city of Antananarivo to a poor rural family, Rakoto Frah surmounted the challenges posed by his underprivileged origins to become the most acclaimed 20th century performer of the sodina flute, one of the oldest traditional instruments on the island. Through frequent international concerts and music festival performances, he promoted the music of the highlands of Madagascar and became one of the most famous Malagasy artists, both within Madagascar and on the world music scene. After gaining regional recognition for his sodina skills as a youth, Rakoto Frah rose to national fame in 1958 when he was selected by Malagasy President Philibert Tsiranana to perform on the sodina for the visiting French president Charles de Gaulle. This event launched his career as a professional musician.  He first played at traditional ceremonies around the country, then expanded his performances from 1967 to include participation in international music competitions and festivals. His popularity declined in the 1970s but underwent a revival that began in the mid-1980s and continued until his death in 2001. During this period Rakoto Frah recorded ten albums, toured extensively in Madagascar and overseas, was featured in two French documentaries, and collaborated with a variety of international and Malagasy artists. Over the course of his career he recorded over 800 original compositions. Rakoto Frah and his sodina were depicted on the 200 ariary Malagasy banknote in honor of his key role in revitalizing and internationally popularizing the sodina. Despite the artist's worldwide acclaim, he lived simply and died having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship. His death was widely mourned and marked by a state funeral, and in 2011 a famadihana (the Malagasy highland ""turning of the bones"" funerary tradition) was organized to celebrate the artist's life.",ee3863d61e4893f6221733509c406c90,What is the common name of the person who promoted the music of the highlands of Madagascar?,Rakoto Frah,Rabezoza,bert,89fed1eae1523b0597cc21409eecfd92,What is the common name of the person who underwent a revival in the mid 1980s?,Rakoto Frah,"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah,",bert,49481e4d40ac1a48ad3a0be245bad424,What is the common name of the person whose popularity declined in 1970s?,Rakoto Frah,Philibert,bert,92a1fc823c256ef4960f088734c830fa,What is the real name of the person who expanded his performances from 1967 onward to include participation in international music competitions and festivals?,Philibert Rabezoza,"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah,",bert,e0b4186371526cbc818d12b8c23d127c,What is the common name of the person who died in 2001?,Rakoto Frah,Frah,bert,a1456461b396f97ba4a56192eaa92c48,What is the common name of the person who was selected by the Malagasy President to perform on the sodina for the visiting French president?,Rakoto Frah,"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah,",bert,f83464444fa71b0625e8f5eb328eb9e5,What is the common name of the person who died having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship?,Rakoto Frah,Frah,bert,e65881a248b99add0c8714c0c34c0f29,What is the real name of the person who was selected by Malagasy President Philibert Tsiranana to perform on the sodina for the visiting French president?,Philibert Rabezoza,Rakoto Frah,bert,481cc94cfdc8a4260c15d97f3d4cee62,What is the common name of the person who became one of the most famous Malagasy artists?,Rakoto Frah,"Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah,",bert,7d638b75750a3a805d634d73866de18e,What is the common name of the person who became one of the most famous Malagasy artists?,Rakoto Frah,Philibert Rabezoza,bert,8c4053dff89d57b0f4f939889f93269a

"Philibert Rabezoza was born in 1923 in Ankadinandriana, a suburb of Antananarivo. His mother was born in Antananarivo and his father, a herdsman and farmer from Fianarantsoa, had previously been a singer at the Merina royal court before the colonization of Madagascar in 1897. Both of Philibert's parents were already aged at the time of his birth and they struggled to care for their new son alongside his six brothers and four sisters. As a child, Philibert assisted his family with looking after the livestock and farming their plot of land. In his early years he was given the nickname Rakoto by an older brother of the same name.Like many residents of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the sodina, an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One of the oldest and most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from Borneo around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the central highlands. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his skills by listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. His competitors, who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he stepped forward to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at Mahamasina stadium in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left the bakery to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.",33476d19cc61a4901489d2a9c6dba1b0,What is the first name of the person who honed their skills by listening to the village elders' sodina performances?,Philibert,Rakoto,bert,8def4108d7e1566742e3ba250260cd93,What is the first name of the person whose father was from Fianarantsoa?,Philibert,Philibert Rabezoza,bert,e4f0172081926cbc491513180c5868b9,What is the first name of the person whose father was a herdsman and a farmer?,Philibert,Rabezoza,bert,81769eadcb722f07696516240c5b7d1d,What is the first name of the person who began playing the sodina when he was 7 years old?,Philibert,"Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition.

"Princess Anne plans to run away with Freddie Granton, the commoner secretary of her father, King Eric VIII, once her domineering mother, Queen Martha, has left for a vacation in America. Anne is therefore aghast when the Marquis of Birten brings news that he has negotiated her political marriage to Prince William of Grec, a man she has never even met. Dismissing Anne's vehement protests, the Queen is delighted, a feeling not shared by Anne's loving but ineffectual father. Meanwhile, the Premier and General Northrup warn that a revolution is brewing. He wishes to execute large numbers of political prisoners, but cannot without the King's signature. The Queen wholeheartedly approves of these stern measures. The King promises to attend to it, but after Northrup and the Queen leave, he orders his secretary to misplace the death warrants. Led by Laker, the rebels rise up after Northrup gets Parliament to grant him dictatorial powers. Anne seizes the opportunity to try to flee with Granton, with her father's approval. However, when she believes that the King is in real danger, she refuses to leave him. Doctor Fellman, a moderate rebel leader, comes to see the King to demand his abdication, but agrees to stop the fighting in favor of negotiation. Then Northrup insists he is in charge now and laughs in derision when the King claims the people are stronger than Northrup's army and navy. Next to arrive is Prince William. Despite his admission that he dislikes Anne, he is prepared to do his duty and go through with the wedding. Then Fellman and Laker show up. The King surprises Northrup by dismissing him from his service and putting Fellman in charge, ordering him to set up general elections as soon as possible.",06c75d69577462c79cf95a573f2cdc20,What title is held by the man whom the King puts in charge to set up general elections?,Doctor,"Princess Anne plans to run away with Freddie Granton, the commoner secretary of her father, King Eric VIII,",bert,139d3a02ac46e7f5002b8c52cb3adcb2,What is the title of the person who is to be married to Prince William of Grec?,Princess,"Princess Anne plans to run away with Freddie Granton, the commoner secretary of her father, King Eric VIII,",bert,1652b8d89b20761135ae3f0eabe57915,What is the title of the person who is to be married to Prince William of Grec?,Princess,Princess Anne,bert,10d0ff9f42c1536153075004b2fbcb88,Whose execution does the Queen approve of?,political prisoners,"Freddie Granton, the commoner secretary of her father, King Eric VIII,",bert,16f016a6e26e35f7618cfb1e92735459,Whose execution does the Queen approve of?,political prisoners,"Freddie Granton,",bert,007eadb235d33bd60d86fea1057f7d4e,What is the title of the person who is to be married to Prince William of Grec?,Princess,"Queen Martha,",bert,bc48fd4788879314081c5b54aedb7de7,What title is held by the man whom the King puts in charge to set up general elections?,Doctor,Prince,bert,1911fc3903804483dd8d4fce9b83a635,What title is held by the man whom the King puts in charge to set up general elections?,Doctor,Prince William.,bert,040bfbbfc0adcd68b53764e85c6128a0,Whose execution does the Queen approve of?,political prisoners,"King Eric VIII,",bert,d4276b4839e000479678e495477ea07c,What title is held by the man whom the King puts in charge to set up general elections?,Doctor,"King Eric VIII,",bert,4291c9f906a2fcb97f786420338213cd
"Prior to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and its eventual decipherment, the ancient Egyptian language and script had not been understood since shortly before the fall of the Roman Empire. The usage of the hieroglyphic script had become increasingly specialised even in the later Pharaonic period; by the 4th century AD, few Egyptians were capable of reading them.

"Publisher Larry Fellowes believes that his stenographer/secretary (played by Dale Fuller) spends more time with him and makes more decisions than a wife would for her husband. He persuades author Kate Halsey to write a novel based on this premise. When Larry's secretary learns of his plans to marry Linda, the secretary has a nervous breakdown because she is in love with him herself. A new attractive, intelligent and efficient secretary, Anne Murdock, is hired while Larry is on his honeymoon. Larry, a workaholic, begins to neglect his wife working with his secretary, and they both fall in love. Meanwhile, his wife is seeing another man (played by Brooks Benedict), with whom she falls in love. Eventually, Larry kisses Anne while they are working together at his apartment, while Linda makes love with her young gigolo, who gives her the key to his apartment and says goodnight. Linda returns to her husband (after giving them enough time to compose themselves) and tells Larry that they should go to bed as it is very late. Anne watches as Larry goes to the bedroom with his wife and closes the door behind him. She is heartbroken and decides she will give him her resignation in the morning.Linda decides to divorce Larry.

"Puss in Boots is a talking cat named for his signature pair of boots. Puss is a fugitive on the run from the law, looking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the outlaw couple Jack and Jill have the magic beans he has been looking for most of his life, which can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a female cat named Kitty Softpaws interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his origin story and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs. The trio steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert.

"Ratanakiri or Ratanak Kiri (Khmer: រតនគិរី IPA: [ˌreə̯̆ʔ taʔ ˈnaʔ ki ˈriː]), is a province of northeast Cambodia. It borders the provinces of Mondulkiri to the south and Stung Treng to the west and the countries of Laos and Vietnam to the north and east, respectively. The province extends from the mountains of the Annamite Range in the north, across a hilly plateau between the Tonle San and Tonle Srepok rivers, to tropical deciduous forests in the south. In recent years, logging and mining have scarred Ratanakiri's environment, long known for its beauty. For over a millennium, Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland Khmer Loeu people, who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia. During the region's early history, its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as slaves by neighboring empires. The slave trade economy ended during the French colonial era, but a harsh Khmerization campaign after Cambodia's independence again threatened Khmer Loeu ways of life.  The Khmer Rouge built its headquarters in the province in the 1960s, and bombing during the Vietnam War devastated the region. Today, rapid development in the province is altering traditional ways of life. Ratanakiri is sparsely populated; its 184,000 residents make up just over 1% of the country's total population. Residents generally live in villages of 20 to 60 families and engage in subsistence shifting agriculture. Ratanakiri is among the least developed provinces of Cambodia. Its infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak. Health indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor; men's life expectancy is 39 years, and women's is 43 years. Education levels are also low, with just under half of the population illiterate.",00157485a9578908e8e8b818426ee2da,How many people live in the province that borders the provinces of Mondulkiri to the south and Stung Treng to the west?,"184,000","184,000 residents make up just over 1% of the country's total population.

"Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: ""Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound."" When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they ""would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity"". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from ""the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner ... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto.""Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909. As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation.",6e83aae9ed4e072befece3f6e0c2cba5,What was the name of the person that warned Manuel Rosenthal about studying Debussy?,Ravel,"Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent.

"Richard ""Dick"" Purcell, a taxi driver, aspires to achieve his dream of becoming a singer. After a couple of theatre critics discover him while riding in his cab, one of them recommends him to a radio producer. The producer's secretary, Alice Hughes, hears him sing and falls in love with him. She sets up an audition for Dick to sing for the sponsor, Mrs. Flaggenheim. He's late for his audition and blows his big chance.

"Sandringham is recorded in the Domesday Book as ""sant-Dersingham"" and the land was awarded to a Norman knight, Robert Fitz-Corbun after the Conquest. The local antiquarian Claude Messent, in his study The Architecture on the Royal Estate of Sandringham, records the discovery of evidence of the pavements of a Roman villa. In the Elizabethan era a manor was built on the site of the present house, which, by the 18th century, came into the possession of the Hoste Henley family, descendants of Dutch refugees. In 1771 Cornish Henley cleared the site to build a Georgian mansion, Sandringham Hall. In 1834, Henry Hoste Henley died without issue, and the estate was bought at auction by John Motteux, a London merchant. Motteux was also without heirs and bequeathed Sandringham, together with another Norfolk estate and a property in Surrey, to the third son of his close friend, Emily Lamb, the wife of Lord Palmerston. At the time of his inheritance in 1843, Charles Spencer Cowper was a bachelor diplomat, resident in Paris. On succeeding to Motteux's estates, he sold the other properties and based himself at Sandringham. He undertook extensions to the hall, employing Samuel Sanders Teulon to add an elaborate porch and conservatory. Cowper's style of living was extravagant—he and his wife spent much of their time on the Continent—and within 10 years the estate was mortgaged for £89,000. The death of their only child, Mary Harriette, from cholera in 1854 led the couple to spend even more time abroad, mainly in Paris, and by the early 1860s Cowper was keen to sell the estate.",c70825155d67b4f591b0072571b5d13f,What is the first name of the person who was close friends with Lamb?,John,"Emily Lamb, the wife of Lord Palmerston.

"Set 19 years after the events of the first film, the movie deals with unresolved conflict and family strain, and also has elements of a coming of age story. Michael Goorjian reprises his role of Heroin Bob, and acts as a narrator for the film, both in voice over as well as sporadically intercut scenes of him in the afterlife Ross is the child of Trish and Heroin Bob, being conceived shortly before Bob's accidental drug overdose. Ross has been raised by alone by Trish, above her steam punk curio and clothing boutique, and as a result of his mothers adoration of the macabre, as well as his immersion in the concept of death from a young age, he develops into a Victorian Goth. Despite his obvious affiliation, Ross insists that he is part of no social cliques, which is stressed even further when he states that despite a lifelong abstinence from drugs, alcohol, and sex; he is not Straight Edge either.  Upon having his heart broken by his first girlfriend, Ross attempts to drown his sorrows, as well as his lifelong espousal that romantic love is trivial, with the aide of beer and liquor. In an attempt to further help him take his mind off of things, he also begrudgingly goes on a road trip to a punk rock concert with his only friend, Crash, as well as Crash's friend Penny. Ross has a low opinion of punks, despite his association with them, as Crash and Penny are punk rockers, as was his father.",137d66eb26fe8ec683dcae28538034e7,"What two cliques does Trish's son claim not to be a part of, despite his resemblance to them?",Victorian Goth,punks,bert,c00706a7d89c725bc86f9137ce009c49,What is the name of the friend of Heroin Bob's son?,Crash,"Crash, as well as Crash's",bert,6e83dab70c2aa426fc129a3bb57e4e57,What is the name of the friend of Heroin Bob's son?,Crash,Crash's,bert,cf76be481a45550df8759641841e2b9a,What is the full name of the character who was formerly a punk rocker?,Heroin Bob,Ross,bert,48e7e8dd862d67283c537c3799e084e7,What is the full name of the character who was formerly a punk rocker?,Heroin Bob,Penny.,bert,00efd184f6f2c29b11c6ff0a426b8dba,"What two cliques does Trish's son claim not to be a part of, despite his resemblance to them?",Victorian Goth,Crash,bert,efe7f8e4d20e8fc694fdeaca9c6b5694,What is the full name of the character who was formerly a punk rocker?,Heroin Bob,Michael Goorjian,bert,713a9a43e34d6c4bb65aad8a39f7e805,"What two cliques does Trish's son claim not to be a part of, despite his resemblance to them?",Victorian Goth,"Crash, as well as Crash's friend Penny.

"Set between the events of Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 3, the story follows online reporter Chase Carter and his camerawoman Jordan as they cover the stories of the people inside of the walled-in quarantined area in the fictional town of East Mission, Oregon, as the government (running an organization called F.E.Z.A.—Federal Emergency Zombie Authority) attempts to contain a viral outbreak that turns people into ravenous zombies. An anti-viral drug called Zombrex, that keeps the virus at bay, is being administered to those infected. When it becomes clear that the drug is no longer effective and a zombie outbreak purges the town and infects its inhabitants, Chase, Jordan, grieving mother Maggie, and survivor Crystal battle their way out of the city before it gets firebombed. Throughout the film, it is revealed that the Army implanted bad Zombrex in a refugee center to start another outbreak so that the government can be allowed to plant government-mandated Zombrex chips on the infected to track them, framing F.E.Z.A. for giving bad Zombrex to the infected. The coin that Jordan gave to Chase to open a newspaper vending machine at the beginning came in handy when she placed evidence of the Army sabotaging the Zombrex inside the vending machine for him to find. When General Lyons figures out that Jordan and Norton are aware of the Army's actions, he has his men capture them to cover up the truth. In the end, Chase and Crystal manage to survive and get out of city, and Jordan manages to get footage proving the Army's complicity in the new outbreak to Chase, who finds it in the newspaper vending machine; the same footage shows her being taken into custody by the U.S. government, who then implant tracking devices on people who are infected.",48d1c6b3be12103b6c9903e5e8ac360f,Who's making it appear that the group trying to contain the zombie outbreak are to blame?,the Army,the government (running an organization called F.E.Z.A.—Federal Emergency Zombie Authority),bert,868a8875f2402fabc604b358eefb1372,Who is trying to make the reporter realize that the Army is responsible for the outbreak?,Jordan,Chase Carter and his camerawoman Jordan,bert,2ef0f551dc20569aba47f9d358f7fe5c,Who's making it appear that the group trying to contain the zombie outbreak are to blame?,the Army,Chase Carter and his camerawoman Jordan,bert,2ac0efb54864012b90d15adedb45ee1e,What is the job of the person who captures footage that proves the Army's complicity in the outbreak?,camerawoman,reporter,bert,d739c01be88a1a9d5d15ded1d549720b,Who's making it appear that the group trying to contain the zombie outbreak are to blame?,the Army,the government,bert,e9386c04296dda9016d7339f6fb9955c,Where did the camerawoman put the evidence?,the vending machine,"East Mission,",bert,404d1923f8136a2c1a5418e96d590c41,Where did the camerawoman put the evidence?,the vending machine,a newspaper vending machine,bert,9173d8b59b097ca0dffae44b58db6996,Who is trying to make the reporter realize that the Army is responsible for the outbreak?,Jordan,"U.S. government,",bert,94c23222b14e8610fbf0754ea10ed3ca,Who is trying to make the reporter realize that the Army is responsible for the outbreak?,Jordan,General Lyons,bert,6671fde7d5daed6eed0bf3daf14eb485,Who's making it appear that the group trying to contain the zombie outbreak are to blame?,the Army,General Lyons,bert,81822673c6f74f6fd7bc16b472abf864
"Set in New York City, the movie follows a martial artist named Leroy Green (Taimak) (also known as ""Bruce Leeroy""), who has dreams of becoming a great martial artist like his idol Bruce Lee. His master explains that he has reached the final level of martial arts accomplishment known as ""The Last Dragon"". Martial artists who reach this final level are said to be able to concentrate such mystical energy into their hands that they begin to glow.

"She's so fast and good at what she does that you can't afford to waste time on anything, so if we're ready to record drums, for example, we're going to work with whatever we have available right there and then. That's why we worked in such great studios, because we know they have great gear, and we don't need to worry about renting gear. Part of my job as an engineer is to make sure the sessions are not only moving along, but moving along at her pace. After the move to MSR, Beyoncé and her production team began travelling. In the United Kingdom, they worked at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Wiltshire—particularly using Gabriel's multi-instrument room—to create ""Love on Top"". Soon after, Beyoncé joined Jay-Z in a Sydney mansion, as he was working on his collaboration album Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West. There they created a ""primitive studio"" using a microphone, a rig out and Pro Tools software to record. Sessions were also held in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Honolulu.In February 2011, MTV reported the project was nearing completion. 4 was mixed mostly at MixStar Studios in Virginia and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York City. The audio mastering was delayed by a week following the unexpected recording of ""I Was Here"". Diane Warren had played the song to Jay-Z during a telephone conversation, leading him to put Warren and Beyoncé in contact. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs in preparation for the album's release. According to Swivel, an eclectic range of songs were recorded, including ballads, ""weird ethereal things"" and 1990's R&B and Afrobeat-inspired songs.

"Sheyann Webb sees Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. going into Brown Chapel AME Church one day while playing outside with her friends. They are told that Dr. King has come to Selma, Alabama to help the Negro people get voting rights. Sheyann learns many things from Dr. King. He teaches her and her friend Rachel that when asked, ""Children, what do you want?"" their answer should be ""Freedom."" He also teaches her that everyone deserves to be treated with fairness, regardless of the color of their skin, and that children also have a battle to fight. Sheyann wants to get involved and skips school to sneak into the meetings. One night a friend of Sheyann's named Jimmie Lee Jackson is killed. To draw attention to the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson, it is decided that a 54-mile march to the state capital of Alabama will take place. Marchers will present a petition to Governor Wallace to protest that Negroes are not being treated fairly. On Sunday, March 7, 1965, a day that comes to be called Bloody Sunday, Sheyann and other African-American protesters march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge en route to Montgomery, and are attacked by police.

With not enough money to return East, Barbara and Kitty decide to stay, and plan to use their feminine wiles on Gene and his sidekick, Frog Millhouse, to get gene to change his mind about selling.

"Sir Michael Kemp Tippett  (2 January 1905 – 8 January 1998) was an English composer who rose to prominence during and immediately after the  Second World War. In his lifetime he was sometimes  ranked with his contemporary Benjamin Britten as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century. Among his best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage. Tippett's talent developed slowly. He withdrew or destroyed his earliest compositions, and was 30 before any of his works were published. Until the mid-to-late 1950s his music was broadly lyrical in character, before changing to a more astringent and experimental style. New influences, including those of jazz and blues after his first visit to America in 1965, became increasingly evident in his compositions. While Tippett's stature with the public continued to grow, not all critics approved of these changes in style, some believing that the quality of his work suffered as a consequence. From around 1976 Tippett's late works began to reflect the works of his youth through a return to lyricism. Although he was much honoured in his lifetime, critical judgement on Tippett's legacy has been uneven, the greatest praise being generally reserved for his earlier works. His centenary in 2005 was a muted affair; apart from the few best-known works, his music has been performed  infrequently in the 21st century. Having briefly embraced communism in the 1930s, Tippett avoided identifying with any political party. A pacifist after 1940, he was imprisoned in 1943 for refusing to carry out war-related duties required by his military exemption. His initial difficulties in accepting his  homosexuality led him in 1939 to Jungian psychoanalysis; the Jungian dichotomy of ""shadow"" and ""light"" remained a recurring factor in his music. He was a strong advocate of music education, and was active for much of his life as a radio broadcaster and writer on music.",897e0a63f48dd0db401e9a0f1bf04f0d,"What is the last name of the composer among whose best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage?",Tippett,t,bert,c143c9c3a941d1402dcc42158d4a2250,What is the last name of the person whose best-known works include the oratorio A Child of Our Time?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,4b56b7f8d04368e8b88baff002084bf1,What is the last name of the person whose best-known works include the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a theme of Corelli?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,245183f2d9c7dfa0cf18a9c29a6e4885,What is the last name of the composer who destroyed his earliest compositions?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,7f6286a48d73ad0f2c262ba47dc8562c,What is the last name of the person who was 30 before any of his works were published?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,392af631598d657911d30fb5ceab89a3,What is the last name of the person whose first visit to America was in 1965?,Tippett,Tippett's,bert,7ff43ce99ae6875001f942056497eda6,What is the last name of the person whose best-known works include the opera The Midsummer Marriage?,Tippett,t,bert,63b8582c56dccdae07497a2b826f5f85,What is the last name of the person whose first visit to America occurred in 1965?,Tippett,t,bert,ed31ea139fd69e8ce182fdc1d352639f,What is the last name of the person who was sometimes ranked with his contemporary as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century?,Tippett,t,bert,6418c7457dd4747dd9abb66e82ffb2cb,What is the last name of the person whose initial difficulties in accepting his homosexuality led him in 1939 to Jungian psychoanalysis?,Tippett,pett,bert,d232c7d8396d8f56a3c89131fc774844

"Small-town church organist Marion Cullen falls in love with traveling salesman Jimmy Decker. When she learns that the couple who raised her are not really her parents, and that she is actually the illegitimate daughter of a showgirl, she sets out for New York City in search of Jimmy. However, she discovers that he is engaged to Enid Hollister, his boss' daughter. Dr. Travers, who is in love with Marion, offers to help her, but she decides to try to make it on her own. Jobs are scarce, however. She ends up with other hopeful showgirls, among them Dixie Dare, hoping to audition for a part in Ford Humphries' new production. The philandering Humphries likes what he sees in Marion and hires her as a piano accompanist. Dixie gets a job as well, and she and Marion become friends and roommates. Travers sees Humphries and Marion together, and knowing the former's reputation, brings Jimmy to Humphries' party. Jimmy tells Marion that he loves her, but she refuses to break up his marriage. When she also refuses Humphries' advances, he fires her. He then decides to use one of the songs she had composed for his production, claiming he wrote it. When she learns of this, she confronts him, although he denies everything. Jimmy goes to Humphries' suite to convince him to do the right thing.

"Some temples kept sacred animals, which were believed to be manifestations of the temple god's ba in the same way that cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, ranging from a year to the lifetime of the animal. At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent of these animals were the Apis, a sacred bull worshipped as a manifestation of the  Memphite god Ptah, and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.During the Late Period, a different form of worship involving animals developed. In this case, laymen paid the priests to kill, mummify, and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god. These animals were not regarded as especially sacred, but as a species they were associated with the god because it was depicted in the form of that animal. The god Thoth, for instance, could be depicted as an ibis and as a baboon, and both ibises and baboons were given to him. Although this practice was distinct from the worship of single divine representatives, some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose. These practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals, such as the catacombs around the Serapeum of Saqqara where the Apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings.",ca034c4785027aaaffed71722e292775,What did the different form of worshiping animals in the Late Period involve?,"kill, mummify, and bury an animal","kill, mummify, and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god.

"State schools in Somerset are provided by three local education authorities: Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, and the larger Somerset County Council. All state schools are comprehensive. In some areas primary, infant and junior schools cater for ages four to eleven, after which the pupils move on to secondary schools. There is a three-tier system of first, middle and upper schools in the Cheddar Valley, and in West Somerset, while most other schools in the county use the two-tier system. Somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools; Bath and North East Somerset has 13 state and 5 independent secondary schools; and North Somerset has 10 state and 2 independent secondary schools, excluding sixth form colleges. Some of the county's secondary schools have specialist school status. Some schools have sixth forms and others transfer their sixth formers to colleges. Several schools can trace their origins back many years, such as The Blue School in Wells and Richard Huish College in Taunton. Others have changed their names over the years such as Beechen Cliff School which was started in 1905 as the City of Bath Boys' School and changed to its present name in 1972 when the grammar school was amalgamated with a local secondary modern school, to form a comprehensive school. Many others were established and built since the Second World War. In 2006, 5,900 pupils in Somerset sat GCSE examinations, with 44.5% achieving 5 grades A-C including English and Maths (compared to 45.8% for England). Sexey's School is a state boarding school in Bruton that also takes day pupils from the surrounding area. The Somerset LEA also provides special schools such as Newbury Manor School, which caters for children aged between 10 and 17 with special educational needs. Provision for pupils with special educational needs is also made by the mainstream schools.",ab990419fb51b7e860c2223775942bb9,What county's secondary schools have specialist school status?,Somerse,Bath and North East Somerset,bert,a6326f58c14f18832acdf519df8a9f52,What has changed their names over the years?,Some schools,Blue School in Wells and Richard Huish College in Taunton.

"Stefen ""Stef"" Djordjevic is a Serbian American high school defensive back who is gifted in both sports and academics. He is seeking a college football scholarship to escape the economically depressed small western Pennsylvania town of Ampipe and a dead-end job and life working at the mill like his father and brother Greg. He dreams of becoming an engineer right after he graduates from college. Ampipe is a company town whose economy is dominated by the town's main employer, American Pipe & Steel, a steel mill struggling through the downturn of the early 1980s recession. Stef gets through his days with the love of his girlfriend, Lisa Lietzke, and his strong bond with his teammates. Most of the film takes place after the big football game against undefeated Walnut Heights High School. Ampipe appears headed to win the game, when a fumbled handoff in the closing seconds—as well as Stefen's pass interference penalty earlier in the game—leads to a Walnut Heights victory. Following the game, Coach Burt Nickerson lambastes the fumbler in the locker room, telling him he ""quit"" the game. When Stefen retorts that the coach himself quit, the coach kicks him off the team.

"Stefen ""Stef"" Djordjevic is a Serbian American high school defensive back who is gifted in both sports and academics.

"Suddenly, London goes dark and loses all of its electricity.  There is commotion at a cinema, with people demanding their money back.  The owner of the cinema, Karl Verloc, enters through a back entrance to the living quarters above, and pretends to have been asleep and not know anything of the blackout.  His wife, Mrs. Verloc comes to get him and is surprised to see him, but he informs her that he had been sleeping the entire time.  He instructs his wife to return the money to the customers – against her protests – because he has ""some money coming in.""  As the money is about to be disbursed to the customers downstairs, the lights go back on.  It is revealed that sand was put in the boilers as an act of sabotage on London's electricity grid.   The next day, Verloc meets with his contact and it is revealed that he is part of a gang of terrorists from an unnamed European country who are planning a series of attacks in London, though their exact motives are not made clear. Verloc's contact is disappointed that the newspapers mocked the short loss of electricity, and instructs Verloc to place a parcel of ""fireworks"" at the Piccadilly London Underground station.  Verloc tells the contact that he is not comfortable with any act that would cause the loss of life. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard suspects Verloc's involvement in the plot and assigns Detective Sergeant Ted Spencer to investigate Verloc.  Spencer is initially undercover as a greengrocer's helper next to the cinema, and befriends Mrs. Verloc and her little brother, Stevie, who lives with them, by treating them to a fancy dinner.  At this point, Spencer and Scotland Yard are unsure whether Mrs. Verloc is complicit in the terrorist plots or merely innocently unaware.",7af10ef2c8fff050f5bfb4e3691caa6f,Who else lives with the cinema owner besides his wife?,Stevie,Mrs. Verloc,bert,c7ef3a6ec205e6a1576f1af661905179,What is the last name of the person that Scotland yard assigns to the case?,Ted Spencer,Spencer to investigate Verloc.

"Switchboard operator Marie Lawson is conned by admirer Nicky, who tells her it is just a practical joke, into redirecting a phone call. However, Nicky uses what he learns to his own benefit, costing the intended recipient a lot of money. When the victim complains to Marie's boss, telephone repairmen Terry Riley and John are called in to see if the phone was tapped. When it is found not to be, Marie loses her job. Terry is attracted to Marie and eventually talks her into a date. He also gets her hired by businessman John P. Schuyler, whom he had earlier saved from a live electrical wire. When Marie runs into Nicky later, she lets slip that her new employer is expecting a delivery of $90,000 in bonds. As a result, Nicky is able to fool the courier into thinking he is Schuyler and giving him the bonds while Marie is distracted by a flood of calls from his accomplices. When she realizes what has happened, she goes looking for Nicky, but this only serves to make her look guilty. Terry is questioned by the police and then released so he can lead them to her hiding place. It works and she is arrested. When an expensive lawyer shows up on her behalf, Terry becomes suspicious and taps his line with John's reluctant help. Finally, he is able to trace a call to where Nicky and his gang are hiding out. When he goes there, he is easily caught and placed in a bedroom after the phone is ripped out. However, he is not searched. He hooks up a spare phone he has and is able to contact John to bring help. The crooks are captured.

Terry is questioned by the police and then released so he can lead them to her hiding place. It works and she is arrested. When an expensive lawyer shows up on her behalf, Terry becomes suspicious and taps his line with John's reluctant help. Finally, he is able to trace a call to where Nicky and his gang are hiding out. When he goes there, he is easily caught and placed in a bedroom after the phone is ripped out. However, he is not searched. He hooks up a spare phone he has and is able to contact John to bring help.

"Terri Griffith is an aspiring teenage journalist in Phoenix who feels that her teachers don't take her articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl. With her parents out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation, Terri decides to remedy the situation. Enrolling at a rival high school, she enlists the help of her little brother, Buddy, and her best friend Denise to disguise herself as a boy. Along the way she meets Rick Morehouse, a nerd who becomes her pet project. After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls, Terri starts to fall for him. After many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as ""one of the guys"". However, she is stunned when she turns in an article and her teacher still criticizes her work, making Terri realize her gender and looks were never the issue. At the senior prom, a jealous Greg picks a fight with Rick, who ultimately trounces the bully in front of the entire class. When Terri's boyfriend shows up unexpectedly and discovers the ruse, Rick assumes that Terri's big secret was that she was gay. To prove otherwise, Terri opens her shirt and reveals her breasts to Rick. Although she admits to loving him, Rick rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone. To placate the awestruck students, Rick derisively announces that Terri ""has tits"" before leaving the prom and Terri behind.

"Terri Griffith is an aspiring teenage journalist in Phoenix who feels that her teachers don't take her articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl. With her parents out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation, Terri decides to remedy the situation. Enrolling at a rival high school, she enlists the help of her little brother, Buddy, and her best friend Denise to disguise herself as a boy. Along the way she meets Rick Morehouse, a nerd who becomes her pet project. After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls, Terri starts to fall for him. After many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as ""one of the guys"". However, she is stunned when she turns in an article and her teacher still criticizes her work, making Terri realize her gender and looks were never the issue. At the senior prom, a jealous Greg picks a fight with Rick, who ultimately trounces the bully in front of the entire class. When Terri's boyfriend shows up unexpectedly and discovers the ruse, Rick assumes that Terri's big secret was that she was gay. To prove otherwise, Terri opens her shirt and reveals her breasts to Rick. Although she admits to loving him, Rick rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone.

"The British Parliament's efforts to levy new taxes following the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to taxation without representation was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others. Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year. After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution. Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.When the American Revolutionary War began, George Washington was selected to head the colonial army. During the war, the capital was moved to Richmond at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack. In 1781, the combined action of Continental and French land and naval forces trapped the British army on the Virginia Peninsula, where troops under George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown. His surrender on October 19, 1781 led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies.Virginians were instrumental in writing the United States Constitution. James Madison drafted the Virginia Plan in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1789. Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The three-fifths compromise ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the House of Representatives. Together with the Virginia dynasty of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. In 1790, both Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new District of Columbia, though the Virginian area was retroceded in 1846. Virginia is called the ""Mother of States"" because of its role in being carved into states such as Kentucky, which became the 15th state in 1792, and for the numbers of American pioneers born in Virginia.",5d87af111f820e8970c784d79cdcd4e5,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,Patrick,bert,f9f9106efd5781b1549eb2333ed1a3da,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis,bert,f75b5ad3057ab137fcefeb8deefbab65,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,Cornwallis,bert,fa5158caf2a2f06f26d485f648f6a19f,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,George Washington,bert,705670745a334a6fc38ffc990f49fb3e,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,George Washington,bert,25e2fe5a55bfa137ccd5220d538cef8f,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis,bert,b8f49381461d17a02cbc13962bc07434,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,James,bert,19766da0171f9b256738de2712116bc1,What is the name of the person whose surrender led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies?,General Cornwallis,George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau,bert,1af7cc31efdcfa85d21f25faae217707,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,Richard,bert,74eb7fde640c0821d5fbf894ababb938,What is the first name of the person whose work Thomas Jefferson drew upon in drafting the national Declaration of Independence?,George,Patrick Henry and Richard,bert,050a97a99cf31eff011fb6a625f02bcb
"The Convention of 1833 (April 1–13, 1833), a political gathering of settlers in Mexican Texas, was a successor to the Convention of 1832, whose requests had not been addressed by the Mexican government. Despite the political uncertainty resulting from a recently concluded civil war, 56 delegates met in San Felipe de Austin to draft a series of petitions to the Government of Mexico. The volatile William H. Wharton presided over the meeting.  Although the convention's agenda largely mirrored that of the Convention of 1832, delegates also agreed to pursue independent statehood for the province, which was at the time part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas. Under the guidance of Sam Houston, former governor of the US state of Tennessee, a committee drafted a state constitution to submit to the Mexican Congress. The proposed constitution was largely patterned on US political principles, yet retained several Spanish customs.  Delegates also requested customs exemptions and asked that a ban on immigration into Texas be lifted. Some residents complained that this convention, like its predecessor, was illegal.  Nevertheless, Stephen F. Austin journeyed to Mexico City to present the petitions to the government. Frustrated with the lack of progress, in October Austin wrote a letter encouraging Texans to form their own state government.  This letter was forwarded to the Mexican government and Austin was imprisoned in early 1834.  During his imprisonment, the federal and state legislatures later passed a series of measures to placate the colonists, including the introduction of trial by jury.  Austin acknowledged that ""[e]very evil complained of has been remedied.""",e2e0378c6c33b156ed6421cd7f9a96a3,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,Mexico City,bert,ef482e6b641ef07c3f90cb841291dab2,What was the preceding convention to the one that was presided over by a volatile person?,Convention of 1832,Convention of 1833,bert,1d8a00323b048c07cc910e3e955608d7,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,the Mexican Congress.,bert,c60d8e7b9c94942edc7e7d89f8522f38,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,the government,bert,450698b0179bccda830ae76017591196,What state did the former governor of Tennessee help create a constitution??,Texas,"Mexican Texas,",bert,ef973d433924dba016c8022a2a1eee85,What state did the former governor of Tennessee help create a constitution??,Texas,"The Convention of 1833 (April 1–13, 1833), a political gathering of settlers in Mexican Texas,",bert,29e0722d5285750012ad703452110fa0,What was the preceding convention to the one that was presided over by a volatile person?,Convention of 1832,1833,bert,c68d3044193c37c2345e0c1344911788,What state did the former governor of Tennessee help create a constitution??,Texas,"US state of Tennessee,",bert,dc96dc64b216acfa02291a98d1661b89,What state did the former governor of Tennessee help create a constitution??,Texas,The Convention of 1833,bert,5f5ff38e9e4436b7078e02336ae04c60,Where were the petitions created that the man who traveled to Mexico City presented?,The Convention of 1833,San Felipe de Austin,bert,2660e48e5420a88a2266509519bc7c10
"The Greek text on the Rosetta Stone provided the starting point. Ancient Greek was widely known to scholars, but they were not familiar with details of its use in the Hellenistic period as a government language in Ptolemaic Egypt; large-scale discoveries of Greek papyri were a long way in the future. Thus, the earliest translations of the Greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling with the historical context and with administrative and religious jargon. Stephen Weston verbally presented an English translation of the Greek text at a Society of Antiquaries meeting in April 1802.Meanwhile, two of the lithographic copies made in Egypt had reached the Institut de France in Paris in 1801. There, librarian and antiquarian Gabriel de La Porte du Theil set to work on a translation of the Greek, but he was dispatched elsewhere on Napoleon's orders almost immediately, and he left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon. Ameilhon produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803, in both Latin and French to ensure that they would circulate widely. At Cambridge, Richard Porson worked on the missing lower right corner of the Greek text. He produced a skilful suggested reconstruction, which was soon being circulated by the Society of Antiquaries alongside its prints of the inscription. At almost the same moment, Christian Gottlob Heyne in Göttingen was making a new Latin translation of the Greek text that was more reliable than Ameilhon's, which was first published in 1803. It was reprinted by the Society of Antiquaries in a special issue of its journal Archaeologia in 1811, alongside Weston's previously unpublished English translation, Colonel Turner's narrative, and other documents.",5526c0cf2b58938ab95cccc3314f5d03,What was the full name of the person who Christian Gottlob Heyne's translation was more reliable than?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Richard Porson,bert,97657ae6032e19bf2ed8c53d5587687c,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Gabriel de La Porte du,bert,c86158f6119d7e343c228d5d848ac4a3,What was the full name of the person who Christian Gottlob Heyne's translation was more reliable than?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Hubert-Pascal,bert,5ba4c32f5fdf823d48fe531b354440b4,What is the full name of the person who produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Stephen Weston,bert,259b08efcae0579a2c2946141d73ac60,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Weston,bert,1abea329ba8cbdae60e5b1c0f4034f8a,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Gabriel de La Porte,bert,514af99747802718c7e8ba31b41978ec,What was the full name of the person who Christian Gottlob Heyne's translation was more reliable than?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,bert,2e80f5c0a5927cdee247de23e9487b61,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon.,bert,436cb8404ac9f688d27b143211b4802f,What is the full name of the person who left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague?,Gabriel de La Porte du Theil,Stephen Weston,bert,482f4f9f5820661cd7efe99f450d4363,What is the full name of the person who produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803?,Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon,Richard Porson,bert,88ffc16c8240d7c64151304c9c7481ec
"The OSS now has a full child spy section, of which 13-year-old Carmen Cortez and 10-year-old Juni Cortez have become agents. Even though they were the first of the new Spy Kids Division, they are not considered the top spy kids, and soon they face particularly difficult competition from Gary and Gerti Giggles, the children of double-dealing agent Donnagon Giggles, whom Carmen and Juni helped to rescue in the previous film. It is shown that Carmen defends Gary, and has a crush on him, which strains her relationship with Juni. At a gala event, Donnagon somehow hacks into the teleprompter which the president was reading from, and is named director of the OSS. A fight ensues when a group of Magna Men arrive and render all adults unconscious. They are after the ""Transmooker"", a highly coveted device which can shut off all electronic devices. Juni recovers it, but drops it when Gary tries to take it from him. Gary then frames Juni for the loss, resulting in Juni being fired. In his new position as director, Donnagon can carry on with his plan to steal the Transmooker, so he can rule the world. The next morning Carmen hacks into the database and reinstates Juni as an agent. They take a mission meant for Gary and Gerti to recover the Transmooker. She and Juni use some hints from Alexander Minion, and follow the trail to a mysterious island where all electronics refuse to work. Gary and Gerti meanwhile are sent to the Gobi Desert and while trying to pinpoint their position manage to fall into a pit of feces. Shortly after arriving Carmen and Juni meet Romero, a lunatic scientist. Romero has been attempting to create genetically-miniaturized animals, so he can make a profit by selling the animals to kids in ""miniature zoos.""

"The Symphony No. 3, Op. 36, also known as the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs (Polish: Symfonia pieśni żałosnych), is a symphony in three movements composed by Henryk Górecki in Katowice, Poland, between October and December 1976. The work is indicative of the transition between Górecki's dissonant earlier manner and his more tonal later style and ""represented a stylistic breakthrough: austerely plaintive, emotionally direct and steeped in medieval modes."" It was premièred on 4 April 1977, at the Royan International Festival, with Stefania Woytowicz as soprano and Ernest Bour as conductor.A solo soprano sings Polish texts in each of the three movements. The first is a 15th-century Polish lament of Mary, mother of Jesus, the second a message written on the wall of a Gestapo cell during World War II, and the third a Silesian folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans in the Silesian uprisings. The first and third movements are written from the perspective of a parent who has lost a child, and the second movement from that of a child separated from a parent. The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation through war. Until 1992, Górecki was known only to connoisseurs, primarily as one of several composers from the Polish School responsible for the postwar Polish music renaissance. That year, Elektra-Nonesuch released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the London Sinfonietta, that topped the classical charts in Britain and the United States. To date, it has sold more than a million copies, vastly exceeding the expected lifetime sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th-century composer. This success, however, has not generated similar interest in Górecki's other works.",f85f33b0c3140e115b17d960a6361290,What was the name of the label that released a recording of the Symphony No 3?,Elektra-Nonesuch,"Elektra-Nonesuch released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the London Sinfonietta,",bert,639a8f7067f7d8d67c66da0d5f2e226b,What is the alternative name of the symphony that premiered on 4 April?,Symphony of Sorrowful Songs,"Symphony No. 3,",bert,240053215dff3d2288a1736601400fef,In what year did the London Sinfonietta perform Henry Gorecki's symphony?,1992,1976,bert,d36e4736a011f371c707598bf718b279,What was the name of the label that released a recording of the Symphony No 3?,Elektra-Nonesuch,Elektra-Nonesuch released,bert,8d6505222549890636fb146d41a13686,What is the alternative name of the symphony that premiered on 4 April?,Symphony of Sorrowful Songs,"Symphony No. 3, Op. 36,",bert,384bcdcfbf5593163770d465daa07b69,In what year did the London Sinfonietta perform Henry Gorecki's symphony?,1992,"Until 1992,",bert,842a692d0419306bfd3f1eeb326425f9,What was the name of the label that released a recording of the Symphony No 3?,Elektra-Nonesuch,Elektra-Nonesuch released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the London,bert,a2743e93efde00ef4c0a11e2fc617716,What is the alternative name of the symphony that premiered on 4 April?,Symphony of Sorrowful Songs,"3, Op. 36,",bert,a7cb44dc3ac46aa332e259432c7e0ddc,In what year did the London Sinfonietta perform Henry Gorecki's symphony?,1992,October,bert,b20ab346e7b4af0ed1765a550b370659,In what year did the London Sinfonietta perform Henry Gorecki's symphony?,1992,1977,bert,0215ace4b88a074213a14e7a87254b85
"The centrifuge process was regarded as the only promising separation method in April 1942. Jesse Beams had developed such a process at the University of Virginia during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with uranium hexafluoride, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.Scaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with 1-meter (3 ft 3 in) rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with 4-meter (13 ft) rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting, and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required. Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work on a series of improvements which promised to increase the efficiency of the process. However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant. In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee following a recommendation by Conant, Nichols and August C. Klein of Stone & Webster.",c9980eccf0cd23cbe1df576fde8ff3a4,What is the first name of the person who was able to separate uranium-235?,Jesse,Karl,bert,c911dc711eae8a5eecd12eb8b0cc5e78,What required high rotational speeds?,centrifuge process,The centrifuge,bert,610fdc99dfb0b70f422a7d3eddf1057b,What are the first names of the two people who began work on a series of improvements with Urey which promised to increase the efficiency of the process?,Karl,"Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required.

The bridge is a National Recreation Trail, and connects to the Dutchess Rail Trail to the east, creating a contiguous 18.2-mile (29.3 km) rail trail system that spans both Ulster and Dutchess counties.The Hudson Valley trail continues 0.5 miles (0.80 km) west from the Poughkeepsie Bridge to a bridge over Mile Hill Road, then another 0.1 miles (0.16 km) to a crossing at US 9W. At the 1-mile (1.6 km) mark, the trail reaches a bridge over Vineyard Avenue. About 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the bridge, the trail crosses under New Paltz Road. Almost 0.5 miles (0.80 km) from this road, the trail reaches the Black Creek Wetlands Complex. Black Creek is one of the two ""principal streams"" to run through Lloyd; it bisects the town as it flows north and pools in a pond. The wetlands complex itself is important for water drainage. Part of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation region 3, the complex contains Plutarch Swamp and one of the region's largest dwarf shrub bogs, hosting a variety of rare species. The complex also includes the Swarte Kill, Lloyd's second major waterway. The trail continues an additional 0.5-mile (0.80 km) past the beginning of the complex to Tony Williams Park.There are four parking areas along the trail, by Haviland Road, Commercial Avenue, the Rotary pavilion, and at Tony Williams Park. The trail is 12 feet (3.7 m) wide and 4 miles (6.4 km) long; it is paved with asphalt and suitable for hiking, bicycling, horseback riding, roller blading, and cross country skiing.In 2018, Hudson Valley law firm Mainetti & Mainetti, P.C. published an updated bicycle map that showed the proposed route of the Hudson Valley Rail Trail, and how it links the Walkill Valley Rail Trail and River-to-Ridge-Trail with the Dutchess County Rail Trail.",e60afaabee7b2059f565dff5d6958bb7,How wide in meters is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,3.7 m,12 feet,bert,1f4fc4ec9ff6580838e23031f5fad995,What is the total length in kilometers is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,6.4 km,18.2,bert,04cbd6188c04f0ad0ad4166de72b1d5d,How wide in feet is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,12 feet,12 feet (3.7 m,bert,669658a7bb2ec7a7a1bb94307015fb15,How wide in meters is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,3.7 m,12 feet (3,bert,0499c3889821a8af07cf5abd4aa4f4c3,How wide in feet is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,12 feet,12 feet (3,bert,f19a2ce987b487e4c20734c7f50bcc69,What is the total length in kilometers is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,6.4 km,6.4,bert,f7a4bbc2002633bf4ea306b4f39e2110,What is the total length in kilometers is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,6.4 km,18.2-mile,bert,82e4edc41c7482f26385ec4a124ac4ec,How wide in feet is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,12 feet,12 feet (3.7,bert,944e64a0d873185bdb09e01b7cff7ff4,What is the total length in miles is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,4 miles,6.4 km,bert,c3e5a1c154ca86b7ca1d03153ef16a86,What is the total length in miles is the Hudson Valley Rail Trail?,4 miles,18.2,bert,143993fa86c6c56c5f9d0afc731e083a

"The film begins with Francisco Francis running in the jungle with his family while soldiers are shooting and killing people around them.  The scene changes to an office building where Tony Green is speaking to Bruce in Clearbec corporate offices telling him that Francisco had broken into the local offices and stolen their files. As he converses with Bruce, he orders Renaldo, a young aide in his office, to hurry. Renaldo and Tony leave the local offices amid gunfire and chaos, but pause when a woman shouts at Renaldo. She is his mother; she is shot and killed by soldiers as Renaldo looks on. Tony shows his corporate ID to the soldiers and pulls Renaldo into his car. As they attempt to leave the city, they stop at a road block and watch soldiers gun down an unarmed man. Renaldo jumps out of the car and escapes the carnage.

"The film begins with a mock newsreel sequence showing the chaos around the death of 31-year-old film star Rudolph Valentino. Thousands of fans mob the funeral home until order is restored, at which point the important women in Valentino's life come to mourn. Each remembers him via flashbacks. The first of these women Bianca de Saulles who knew Valentino when he was a  taxi dancer, and gigolo in New York City. He shares with her his dream of owning an orange grove in California.  After mobsters rob him, he decides he must make the move west.   Next is a young movie executive and screenwriter named June Mathis, who has an unrequited love for Valentino. She first meets Valentino in California, where he upsets Mr. Fatty by grabbing the starlet next to Arbuckle and romancing her into becoming his first wife, Jean Acker.

"The film begins with the bear family sleeping peacefully at home, when suddenly, the alarms of dozens of clocks located on Junyer Bear's table go off. Papa Bear wakes up completely and runs to try to turn them off. Junyer excitedly wakes up and exclaims: ""Oh, boy! At last the great day has come at last! Oh, boy!"" Papa Bear asks how to stop the alarms, and his son simply shushes the clocks. Dad gets angry and smacks a clock in Junyer's face. Mom replies: ""But, Henry ...""  Henry shouts: ""Well! What do you Want!?"" To which Mom replies: ""It's Father's Day, Dear."" Then Mama Bear and Junyer Bear make several activities to please Papa Bear on his day, but only cause discomfort and misery, ending with a theatrical presentation in which there are three numbers, of which the latter involves a song called, Let's Give a Cheer for Father.

"The film begins with the return of a group of friends consisting of Tanis Half-Elven, Sturm Brightblade, Caramon Majere, Raistlin Majere, Flint Fireforge, Tasslehoff Burrfoot. Kitiara Uth Matar, the half sister of the twins Caramon and Raistlin, was supposed to be there as well, but for reasons unexplained at the time could only send a mysterious note. The Companions had separated five years previously to pursue their own quests.On the eve of their reunion, the Companions discover that Solace, the village where many of them made their home, is very different from the peaceful village they had left five years previous. Solace has been taken over by a religious order called the Seekers. They are collaborating with the Dragon Highlords who are preparing for the conquest of the continent of Ansalon. Solace is now an armed camp as hobgoblin soldiers patrol the once peaceful village. Tanis, Flint and Tasslehoff meet up outside of Solace, and as they enter the village, they are accosted by Fewmaaster Toede: a hobgoblin commander, and some of his minions. Forced to fight, the threesome kill Toede's minions, and continue to the Inn of the Last Home to meet up with their friends, and, as circumstance would have it, two barbarians, Riverwind and Goldmoon. Kitiara Uth Matar is absent, having sent a letter to Tanis saying that ""her new lord is keeping her busy"". The Companions soon discover that the Seekers are searching for a Blue Crystal Staff.

"The film begins with the return of a group of friends consisting of Tanis Half-Elven, Sturm Brightblade, Caramon Majere, Raistlin Majere, Flint Fireforge, Tasslehoff Burrfoot. Kitiara Uth Matar, the half sister of the twins Caramon and Raistlin, was supposed to be there as well, but for reasons unexplained at the time could only send a mysterious note. The Companions had separated five years previously to pursue their own quests.On the eve of their reunion, the Companions discover that Solace, the village where many of them made their home, is very different from the peaceful village they had left five years previous. Solace has been taken over by a religious order called the Seekers. They are collaborating with the Dragon Highlords who are preparing for the conquest of the continent of Ansalon. Solace is now an armed camp as hobgoblin soldiers patrol the once peaceful village. Tanis, Flint and Tasslehoff meet up outside of Solace, and as they enter the village, they are accosted by Fewmaaster Toede: a hobgoblin commander, and some of his minions. Forced to fight, the threesome kill Toede's minions, and continue to the Inn of the Last Home to meet up with their friends, and, as circumstance would have it, two barbarians, Riverwind and Goldmoon. Kitiara Uth Matar is absent, having sent a letter to Tanis saying that ""her new lord is keeping her busy"". The Companions soon discover that the Seekers are searching for a Blue Crystal Staff. When Hederick, a Seeker, is accidentally burnt when Riverwind pushes him into the fireplace, Goldmoon heals him with her Blue Crystal Staff, a holy artifact of the goddess Mishakal which possesses healing powers.

"The film is a semi-biographical story based upon the early life and rise to prominence of Native American dog musher George Attla, Jr. (1933–2015).  Attla, known as ""the Huslia Hustler,"" took his nickname from one of his mentors, Jimmy Huntington, who first began winning races during Attla's childhood.  In recent generations, this nickname has become associated with Attla far more than with Huntington.  Attla was a leading star of the 1960s and 1970s in the sport of sprint dog sled racing.  He won the Fur Rendezvous World Championship race, held in Anchorage, Alaska, 10 times between 1958 and 1982.  He also won 8 championships in the Open North American Championship race, held in Fairbanks, Alaska.  In addition, despite his mushing experience being geared more towards sprint than distance racing, Attla competed in the inaugural Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1973, placing fifth.  In a 2011 interview, Attla spoke of the popularity of the Iditarod, and how sprint racing ""is now a second-class sport"" as a result. The general theme of the story centered around Attla's rivalry with the other leading sprint competitors of the day, fellow Alaska Native Gareth Wright (the brother of political gadfly Don Wright and grandfather of modern-day dog musher Ramy Brooks) and Massachusetts musher Roland ""Doc"" Lombard, the preparations for an upcoming big race, and his first major race victory.

He won the Fur Rendezvous World Championship race, held in Anchorage, Alaska, 10 times between 1958 and 1982.  He also won 8 championships in the Open North American Championship race, held in Fairbanks, Alaska.  In addition, despite his mushing experience being geared more towards sprint than distance racing, Attla competed in the inaugural Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1973, placing fifth.  In a 2011 interview, Attla spoke of the popularity of the Iditarod, and how sprint racing ""is now a second-class sport"" as a result. The general theme of the story centered around Attla's rivalry with the other leading sprint competitors of the day, fellow Alaska Native Gareth Wright (the brother of political gadfly Don Wright and grandfather of modern-day dog musher Ramy Brooks) and Massachusetts musher Roland ""Doc"" Lombard, the preparations for an upcoming big race, and his first major race victory. The movie was shot on location in Fairbanks, Alaska.  A number of local actors, including local Alaska Natives, University of Alaska Fairbanks professor Lee Salisbury, and KFAR disc jockey/newscaster Bill Walley, appear in minor roles.",275e4e82a3b522eb15cfc5645f070e13,"What is the real name of the character known as ""the Huslia Hustler""?","George Attla, Jr.","George Attla,",bert,f05952222586cf8eba488375caf50004,What is the full name of the character who won the Fur Rendezvous World Championship race 10 times?,"George Attla, Jr.","Attla, Jr.",bert,67070a0843e431dc0b2b658bd63369df,What is the full name of the character who won the Open North American Championship race 8 times?,"George Attla, Jr.","""the Huslia Hustler,"" took his nickname from one of his mentors, Jimmy Huntington,",bert,965a1d3fa6990ec21b2aa67e10ccc3b8,What is the full name of the person who won the Fur Rendezvous World Championship race 10 times?,"George Attla, Jr","Attla,",bert,9299127568977d6fa98da88a5777d650,What is the full name of the character who won the Open North American Championship race 8 times?,"George Attla, Jr.","George Attla,",bert,5b09ec5dac936a74cc70e97cecad1e4d,What is the full name of the person who is now known as the Huslia Hustler?,"George Attla, Jr",George,bert,169f779071627fd1e9dd9610aafb38a3,What is the full name of the character who won the Open North American Championship race 8 times?,"George Attla, Jr.","Jimmy Huntington,",bert,60462d1140dc986dc4557cdd2834c0be,What is the full name of the person who is now known as the Huslia Hustler?,"George Attla, Jr","Attla, Jr.",bert,054d8b4d0c7e85f0acfd20746935318f,"What is the real name of the character known as ""the Huslia Hustler""?","George Attla, Jr.","Attla, known as ""the Huslia Hustler,"" took his nickname from one of his mentors, Jimmy Huntington,",bert,03b488d9dee03928da35e67f62a83105,What is the full name of the character who won the Open North American Championship race 8 times?,"George Attla, Jr.",George,bert,abab827540d791f1dd003d2f8204429f
"The film opens in 1099 at the end of the First Crusade, depicting Christian Crusaders sacking Jerusalem and slaughtering the local population. A Flemish Christian knight named Charles Le Vaillant becomes demoralized by the horrors of war and decides to create a new religious order. This new order brings together members from the three main religions of the region: Christians, Jews, and Muslims. As a self-declared leader and messiah, Charles writes the sacred texts of the Order. While traveling to Syria his camp is attacked by the Christian knights, who kill Le Vaillant. The last chapter from their religious text, buried by Le Vaillant in a secret place, becomes lost in the desert after the attack. In the modern day, Rudy Cafmeyer, a thief and smuggler of valuable historical artifacts, breaks into a high-security building and steals a precious Fabergé egg. He triggers an alarm in the process and is forced to fight his way out of the building, finding no car to meet him because the getaway driver, Yuri, was forced to leave by police. His problems are compounded when a potential buyer attempts to steal the egg and falls on it, destroying it. It is revealed that Rudy's father is archaeologist and museum curator Oscar ""Ozzie"" Cafmeyer. Ozzie travels to Israel in search of a secret he has discovered and is kidnapped while on the phone with Rudy, who travels to Jerusalem to rescue him. Ozzie's associate, Professor Walt Finley, gives Rudy the key to a safe-deposit box in East Jerusalem before being gunned down by unknown assailants. Rudy opens the safe-deposit box and finds an ancient map showing a series of tunnels and a treasure room beneath Jerusalem.",ae441abd194b336febc0332454382d6d,What is the first name of the person who triggers an alarm while stealing something?,Rudy,Oscar,bert,daae672d31a6c4ce4d280dfc9aeacfd2,What is the first name of the person who triggers an alarm while stealing something?,Rudy,Charles,bert,7688140ec1ab678c90d32ab476703fb6,Who falls on the Faberge egg?,a potential buyer,"Yuri,",bert,6ced8b79ec284d4ef74fa3c07fe25ed9,What is the first name of the person who is forced to fight their way out of a building during a robbery?,Rudy,"Yuri,",bert,9f217bcb9dff6ae0836b853fa0185b42,What is the first name of the person who triggers an alarm while stealing something?,Rudy,"Yuri,",bert,6fafa174790d013fc240d6566a3e7cb0,What is the first name of the person who is forced to fight their way out of a building during a robbery?,Rudy,Oscar,bert,70ac5d88195ee4ff7ff54da1e3f5a0a5,Who falls on the Faberge egg?,a potential buyer,"Yuri, was forced to leave by police.

"The film opens in 1940, with Lawrence in a screening room watching a documentary film chronicling her life, then flashes back to Clapham in 1915, when she leaves home to join her vaudevillian father in a dilapidated Brixton music hall. Eventually she joins the chorus in André Charlot's West End revue. She reunites with close childhood friend Noël Coward who provides witty commentary on Gertie's actions. Charlot becomes annoyed with Gertie's efforts to stand out, literally, from the chorus. He threatens to fire her, but stage manager Jack Roper intercedes and gets her hired as a general understudy to the leads.  She marries Jack, but it becomes clear she is more inclined to perform onstage than stay home and play wife. While pregnant, she insists on going on for an absent star, and captivates the audience with her own star-making performance of ""Burlington Bertie"". Charlot and Roper witness the audience's warm approval, and both realize, Charlot grudgingly and Roper wistfully, that Gertie belongs on the stage. After their daughter Pamela is born, Gertrude is angered when Roper takes the baby on a pub crawl, and leaves him.

"The film opens in Edwardian times in Hocombe Woods, where Doris Mann and Albert Potter are courting. When Albert searches the woods for a Peeping Tom, Doris is abducted by a monster named Oddbod, which leaves a finger behind. Albert, finding the finger, rushes to the police station and reports the matter to Detective Constable Slobotham, who in turn tells his superior, the henpecked Detective Sergeant Sidney Bung, who has been investigating similar disappearances in the same woods. After searching the woods for further clues, the group stumble across the eerie Bide-A-Wee Rest Home, and are shown to the sitting-room by the butler, Sockett. Sockett informs the mistress of the house, Valeria, of their presence, and she awakens her electrically-charged brother, Dr. Orlando Watt.

"The film opens in Edwardian times in Hocombe Woods, where Doris Mann and Albert Potter are courting. When Albert searches the woods for a Peeping Tom, Doris is abducted by a monster named Oddbod, which leaves a finger behind. Albert, finding the finger, rushes to the police station and reports the matter to Detective Constable Slobotham, who in turn tells his superior, the henpecked Detective Sergeant Sidney Bung, who has been investigating similar disappearances in the same woods. After searching the woods for further clues, the group stumble across the eerie Bide-A-Wee Rest Home, and are shown to the sitting-room by the butler, Sockett. Sockett informs the mistress of the house, Valeria, of their presence, and she awakens her electrically-charged brother, Dr. Orlando Watt. Dr Watt speaks to the three men, who are frightened from the house when Dr. Watt vanishes and re-appears when his electrical charge runs down.

"The film opens on Rachel and Hector's (Matthew Goode) wedding day in North London, England. Rachel's bossy and overbearing mother, Tess, is in charge of planning the wedding. Rachel's dazed father Ned and her much younger sister Henrietta are  supportive. Prior to Rachel arriving and the ceremony beginning, flower shop owner Luce who was contracted by Tess as the wedding florist, and Henrietta are rushing along while chatting with Hector and Cooper ""Coop"" (Darren Boyd). Luce answers Henrietta's trick question which makes Henrietta take an immediate liking to her, and she asks if Luce can sit by her during the wedding.

"The film opens with ""The Super Fan"", an avid Chiefs fan, making his 3rd belt. The film depicts the lives of 5 Chiefs players: Mike Bajurny (brother of producer David Bajurny), Brady Austin, Mike Henderson and Cory Holland. With the exception of Henderson, all of these players live in an abandoned storage area on the second story of Colisée de Laval, affectionately known as ""The Rat's Nest"". Several players discuss the living conditions. Some don't mind it, while other say that since the room is near an exit, the apartments will not be used for a fire exit. Henderson mentions that the living situation isn't bad for a young single guy. Henderson discusses his role with the team. He doesn't think he is limited to being a fighter, but considers himself to have an Owen Nolan-type of role with the team, where he could be tough as needed. The Super Fan shows how he prepares for a big game: which involves the shining of one of his championship belts.  A shot of the arena is shown with fans mock-fighting each other with security surrounding the ice. Craig Martin discusses a line brawl and how it originated.

Bajurny's mother does not approve of her son's role as a fighter. Henderson's fiancé discusses how they met and how she feels about him playing professional hockey. A 6'5"", 265 lbs ex-military strong man by the name of Tim Leveque comes to play for the Chiefs.

"The film opens with Sir John Falstaff and Justice Shallow walking through the snow, then to a warm fire inside the Boar's Head Tavern, as the two reminisce. After a main credit sequence, the narrator explains that King Henry IV of England has succeeded Richard II, whom he has killed. Richard II's true heir, Edmund Mortimer, is a prisoner in Wales, and Mortimer's cousins Northumberland, Worcester, and Northumberland's son Hotspur demand that Henry rescue Mortimer. The king refuses, and thus Mortimer's cousins begin to plot Henry's overthrow. To Henry's great dissatisfaction, his son Prince Hal spends most of his time at the Boar's Head Tavern, drinking and carousing with prostitutes, thieves and other criminals under John Falstaff's patriarchal influence. Falstaff insists that he and Hal should think of themselves as gentlemen, but Hal warns Falstaff that he will one day reject both this lifestyle and Falstaff. The next morning Hal, Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Poins disguise themselves in Gadshill to prepare to rob a group of traveling pilgrims. After Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto rob the pilgrims, Hal and Poins jump out in disguises and take the stolen treasure from Falstaff as a joke. Back at the Boar's Head Tavern, Falstaff begins to tell Hal and Poins with increasing exaggeration the story of how the money was stolen from him. Hal and Poins poke holes in Falstaff's tale until they reveal their joke to the entire group. In celebration of the newly recovered stolen treasure, Falstaff and Hal take turns impersonating Henry, with a cooking pot crown and vocal impressions. Falstaff's Henry chastises Hal for spending his time with common criminals, but names Sir John Falstaff as his one virtuous friend. Hal's Henry calls Falstaff a ""misleader of youth"".",7ef0f528a8d3f9afd0fe22f39513b0a8,Who begins to plot to overthrow a king?,Northumberland,"Edmund Mortimer,",bert,be2f8a9bc0f52124dd74df7db2f620d1,What is the full name of the person who killed someone?,Henry IV,King Henry IV of England,bert,b5bf8cc6842109891c7fb5e08ad343f0,What is the full name of the person who killed someone?,Henry IV,"King Henry IV of England has succeeded Richard II, whom he has killed.

"The film was written by Pulitzer Prize winner Ira Berkow, and narrated by actor Dustin Hoffman.  It was directed by Peter Miller, a documentary filmmaker known for his previous films A Class Apart, Sacco and Vanzetti, and The Internationale.Dustin Hoffman does not normally narrate films, and initially turned down the project.  But when he looked at the script, he changed his mind, saying: ""Oh, this is about bigotry and overcoming anti-Semitism, about discrimination and these issues that I grew up with, that really matters to me"".The film opens with a clip from the 1980 satirical comedy film Airplane!, in which a flight attendant is asked by a passenger if she has anything light to read.  She responds by offering an ultra-thin leaflet, saying:  ""How about this leaflet, Famous Jewish Sports Legends?""The stereotype of Jews as non-athletic, as well as anti-semitism, are two issues that many Jewish baseball players faced and had to overcome.  Noted anti-semite Henry Ford wrote on May 22, 1920:  ""If fans wish to know the trouble with American baseball they have it in three words—too much Jew.""  A number of early Jewish ballplayers changed their names, so that it would not be apparent that they were Jewish.The movie discusses the key Jewish ballplayers in each decade since baseball started in the 1860s, and how that helped Jews assimilate and counteract the stereotype of Jews as cerebral but non-athletic.  The film is in part about Jewish immigration and assimilation into American society, bigotry against Jews, the passing on of Jewish traditions even during assimilation, heroism, and the breaking of Jewish stereotypes.Director Miller said:  At its heart, this is a film about overcoming stereotypes. Bigotry against Jews has faded a great deal ...",ca2d77bc90ee7510a6671bc77727b765,What is the name of the person that worked on the film because it was about anti-Semitism?,Dustin Hoffman,stereotypes.Director Miller,bert,94c0b1ba18b76fc88a24e4861736ba28,What is the name of the person that was know for The Internationale?,Peter Miller,Ira,bert,eab04c39268c40f0b52914556bc3defa,What is the name of the person that worked on the film because it was about anti-Semitism?,Dustin Hoffman,"Ira Berkow,",bert,04cbeedc92ba08a436bb328b18b11147,What roll did Dustin Hoffman have in the film?,narrated,"Ira Berkow,",bert,3b164253e09a694ef80bbf23100deadc,What is the name of the person that worked on the film because it was about anti-Semitism?,Dustin Hoffman,"Ira Berkow, and narrated by actor Dustin Hoffman.

"The frame story is narrated by a white father, who has recently returned from India, to his son. He explains that man's closest relative in nature is the orangutan, which translates literally as ""man of the forest."" He then tells the story of Ali and his son Bin, natives of Sumatra, who hunt in a jungle village. Ali wants to shoot a marauding tiger, but the orangutans Tua and his baby Rango get in the way, and Rango is almost grabbed by the tiger. While Ali prepares a tiger trap, the orangutans enter Ali's hut and feast on the stored goods. Dozens of orangutans join them, ransacking the hut. When Ali and Bin return to discover the havoc, Ali captures Rango and puts him on a chain. Later, Ali saves Tua from a black panther.  In the night, a tiger enters the camp, and Rango warns Bin in time for him to shoot and scare the tiger away. At dawn, Tua comes for Rango and eats in the hut, while Bin tends the water buffaloes. After the tiger kills a deer, the orangutans scream warnings to each other and flee. Two male tigers approach and chase Bin, Rango and Tua. When Bin is cornered by a tiger, Rango comes to the rescue. The tiger kills Rango, who thus sacrifices his own life for the sake of his human friend, but the water buffalo fights the tiger and kills him.

"The governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper, has to pick a replacement for recently deceased U.S. Senator Sam Foley. His corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor, pressures Hopper to choose his handpicked stooge, while popular committees want a reformer, Henry Hill. The governor's children want him to select Jefferson Smith, the head of the Boy Rangers. Unable to make up his mind between Taylor's stooge and the reformer, Hopper decides to flip a coin. When it lands on edge – and next to a newspaper story on one of Smith's accomplishments – he chooses Smith, calculating that his wholesome image will please the people while his naïveté will make him easy to manipulate. Junior Senator Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine, who was Smith's late father's friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator's daughter, Susan. At Senator Paine's home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith's naïve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith's reputation with ridiculous front page pictures and headlines branding him a bumpkin. To keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill.

"The local people have traditionally utilized material from the forest, whether for use in their architecture, to make pirogues (dugout canoes), to provide fiber for weaving, to provide firewood, to gather leaves for traditional medicine, or to flavor their drinks.  Most of the residents are subsistence rice farmers who cultivate irrigated paddies in valleys or who plant on hillsides that have been cleared and burned (slash and burn agriculture, known locally as tavy).  The swamps which formerly covered vast areas of Andapa Basin have been converted to rice paddies which are intensively cultivated; however the Tsimihety traditionally practice slash and burn techniques on the hillsides in preference to irrigated rice fields.  Coffee was an important cash crop before market prices fell in the 1970s, but vanilla remains an important crop for the area.  Until the mid-2000s, vanilla prices were high, but they have since fallen off significantly.  The crash of vanilla prices, along with a rapidly growing population and steady decrease in cultivatable land, has resulted in widespread and extreme poverty.  Between January and April, before the main rice harvest, many people in the region do not receive enough food to eat.  The Sava Region, which includes Marojejy, is the poorest region in Madagascar, and in 2011, continued rises in global food prices—particularly that of imported rice—has made obtaining food more difficult for rural families.Not only have international environmental organizations (such as Conservation International, Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wide Fund for Nature, and Care International) established programs to help local residents, many local people work to improve their situation through environmental and health education programs.  An increase in sustainable agriculture, silviculture, conservation awareness, and improved education and health care have also furthered the goal of protecting the environment and promoting livelihoods centered on the remaining forest.  Limited and responsible ecotourism is also seen as a long-term alternative to continued deforestation.",a6d8a39c9ade93100a4e6add4fe7a54e,What region's local residents did international environmental organizations establish programs to help?,Sava Region,"Marojejy,",bert,1e81f12a6b3fdaa3fac90538caeb7908,What crop is no longer as important to the area after prices fell?,Coffee,vanilla,bert,349acca53f2a5932db5ab25cc1435ae0,What region's local residents did international environmental organizations establish programs to help?,Sava Region,"Marojejy, is the poorest region in Madagascar,",bert,9439519815b936a73ec7c102f1cc2126,What region's local residents did international environmental organizations establish programs to help?,Sava Region,"Sava Region, which includes Marojejy,",bert,9bf102f8545fb18955173de1880c8113,What crop is no longer as important to the area after prices fell?,Coffee,"vanilla remains an important crop for the area.

"The night before Memorial Day, Tyra and Trevor are stabbed to death in their apartment by a cloaked figure in a black and white papier-mâché mask. The next day, Rachel, her cousin Leo, and their five friends (Mickey, Cindy, Seth, Reagan and Jeremy) head to Memorial Lake Campground for the first time since Rachel's adopted brother Danny accidentally drowned there three years ago. After reaching the camp and setting up, the group drink around a campfire and tell ghost stories, though Seth goes back to the cabins to watch television, and catches a news broadcast mentioning the murders of Tyra and Trevor, who were supposed to come along on the trip. Seth rushes back to the others and tells them about what happened to Trevor and Tyra, just as a booby trap launches a spear into Jeremy, killing him, and scattering the group. Seth tries to drive to safety, but runs out of gas, and is confronted by the killer, who sends a man he had earlier captured out to tell Seth to get out of his car. Seth refuses to get out, so the killer persuades him by shooting the hostage. Back at the camp, Mickey bludgeons a masked man with a baseball bat, unmasking him afterward to discover it was Seth, who was gagged and had his hands tied together. The killer then attacks Reagan, killing her by forcing her to crawl across razor blades while he beats her with a hot piece of rebar. Next, Cindy is shot, and Mickey is tortured to death with fish hooks, nails, and a knife. Rachel and Leo regroup, and a hysterical Rachel blames herself for everything that has happened, confessing that she was the one who brought Danny out on the boat the night he drowned. This causes Leo to reveal that he is the killer, and that Danny (who was his biological brother) has been ""speaking"" to him, ordering him to avenge his death by murdering everyone involved in it. Leo tries to kill Rachel, but she shoots him with his own gun, revealing before she does so that she purposely drowned Danny, who she hated.",7fb8b15af574de1734ca386a9fcab500,What is the name of the person who killed Reagan?,Leo,"Seth,",bert,566895a44ceb69bf1a8cbf625f2b9e9c,What are the names of the persons that Seth tells about what happened to Trevor and Tyra?,Rachel,"(Mickey, Cindy,",bert,ee399dd30cf1afdc25581199293e3a6d,Who drowned Danny?,Rachel,Tyra,bert,685e2002607206b4a6be902aa999bfce,Who drowned Danny?,Rachel,Leo,bert,8c49666ffb905b877aed06901170e24f,What is the name of the person who killed Reagan?,Leo,"Mickey bludgeons a masked man with a baseball bat, unmasking him afterward to discover it was Seth,",bert,7dafb31400c5d26153808cea0c2fa055,Who is forced to crawl across razor blades?,Reagan,"The killer then attacks Reagan,",bert,1cef6ff22bb8cbefb9bd84c666124010,What are the names of the persons that Seth tells about what happened to Trevor and Tyra?,Rachel,"Rachel, her cousin Leo, and their five friends (Mickey,",bert,87664ae28f99f7a607a099aabca915cf,Who is forced to crawl across razor blades?,Reagan,"Rachel,",bert,59dc11bddfa9b2caa8833767367a7042,Who is forced to crawl across razor blades?,Reagan,"Seth, who was gagged and had his hands tied together.

"The painting was included in Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition at The Leo Castelli Gallery, a show in which all the works had pre-sold before its opening in February 1962. The exhibition, which ran from February 10 through March 3, 1962, included Engagement Ring, Blam and The Refrigerator. He included the painting in his Artist's Studio—Look Mickey (1973), showing it hanging prominently on the wall of the pictorial space intended to depict his studio as the ideal studio, and implying that his popularity with critic and public ratifies his choice of popular culture subject matter. Reflecting on Look Mickey many years later, he said: The idea of doing [a cartoon painting] without apparent alteration just occurred to me ... and I did one really almost half seriously to get an idea of what it might look like. And as I was painting this painting I kind of got interested in organizing it as a painting and brought it to some kind of conclusion as an aesthetic statement, which I hadn't really intended to do to begin with. And then I really went back to my other kind of painting, which was pretty abstract. Or tried to. But I had this cartoon painting in my studio, and it was a little too formidable. I couldn't keep my eyes off it, and it sort of prevented me from painting in any other way, and then I decided this stuff was really serious ... I would say I had it on my easel for a week. I would just want to see what it looked like. I tried to make it a work of art. I wasn't trying just to copy. I realized that this was just so much more compelling. The painting was bequeathed to the Washington National Gallery of Art after Lichtenstein's death in 1997, following a 1990 pledge in honor of the institution's 50th Anniversary. It remains in the gallery's collection, where, as of November 2012, it is on permanent view.Harold Rosenberg once described Lichtensteins reworking of the comics source as follows: ""...the difference between a comic strip of Mickey Mouse and a Lichtenstein painting of the same was art history, or the fact that Lichtenstein paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""",87417b06f4a82ffb6dec0d37f8bcb903,Where was the painting that was hanging prominently during Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition bequeathed after his death?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington National Gallery,bert,e842ab1cc507362b9e28ff182e1aca81,Where is the cartoon painting on permanent display today?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington National,bert,e8f7ef0dc49cc4fb89aff8c30e7425b9,Where is the cartoon painting on permanent display today?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington,bert,6787d2cfc2bb37a50f3d8a04942b073e,Where is the cartoon painting on permanent display today?,Washington National Gallery of Art,National Gallery of Art,bert,5244f825d39810ea3d79343de69351e2,"What is the last name of the person that said that the man who painted Look Mickey as someone who ""...paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""?",Rosenberg,view.Harold Rosenberg,bert,31b839224db006b3689e03a6254e0106,Where is the cartoon painting on permanent display today?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington National Gallery,bert,e646f2f6f9feb0f51e7362a1e092091d,"What is the last name of the person that said that the man who painted Look Mickey as someone who ""...paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""?",Rosenberg,Leo Castelli,bert,4a8fc631b540a4718c7bf2d504b0504f,"What is the last name of the person that said that the man who painted Look Mickey as someone who ""...paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""?",Rosenberg,Castelli,bert,fb8798bdb72aa7c1102bfdb4acf88764,Where was the painting that was hanging prominently during Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition bequeathed after his death?,Washington National Gallery of Art,Washington,bert,6cde88a114196a31fc964304de369f66,"What is the last name of the person that said that the man who painted Look Mickey as someone who ""...paints with the idea of the museum in mind.""?",Rosenberg,Rosenberg once described Lichtensteins,bert,82dae9fd884603e8c5a6a1399ff5148a
"The pavilions are named for Exelon, a Chicago-based company that generates the electricity transmitted by its subsidiary Commonwealth Edison (ComEd). The city of Chicago has collaborated with Exelon and ComEd on a variety of environmental projects, including the installation of solar power in buildings, support for sustainable design and renewable energy, and furthering educational and social awareness of green architecture in the city. The pavilions cost $7 million, $5.5 million of which was donated by Exelon and ComEd.The lead designer for the North Pavilions was Thomas H. Beeby of Hammond Beeby Rupert Ainge Architects. Beeby's designs for the North Pavilions are ""in harmony with the Harris Theater"", for which he was the architect as well. The North Pavilions are along Randolph Street on either side of the theater, which is Millennium Park's indoor performing-arts venue.The South Pavilions were designed by architect Renzo Piano of Renzo Piano Building Workshop. Piano designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing, which is across Monroe Street from the South Pavilions and opened in 2009. The facades of the South Pavilions are limestone and glass in order to complement the Modern Wing, even though it was not completed until several years after the pavilions were finished. Piano also designed the Nichols Bridgeway, which connects Millennium Park and the Art Institute, and is next to the Southwest Pavilion.The design process for the Exelon Pavilions began in September 2001, with construction starting in January 2004. The general contractor for all four pavilions was Walsh Construction. The South Pavilions were completed in July 2004 and opened when Millennium Park celebrated its grand opening on July 16, 2004. The North Pavilions were not finished in July 2004, but were completed in November of that year.

"The plot of Darfur revolves around six Western journalists who visit a small village in Darfur in western Sudan under the escort of a squad of troops of the African Union peacekeeping mission. When they learn the brutal state sponsored militia called the Janjaweed are heading towards the village, they are faced with an impossible decision: leave Sudan and report the atrocities to the world, or risk their own lives and stay in the hopes of averting a certain slaughter. While most of them flee back to their base, two of the journalists, Freddie Smith, and Theo Schwartz, decide to stay behind along with the Nigerian commander of the AU unit, Captain Jack Tobamke, to try to save the villagers when the Arab Janjaweed enter the village and begin to indiscriminately kill all the Black African men, women, and children. Despite their efforts to save some villagers, Captain Tobamke, Theo, and Freddie are all killed one by one in the subsequent shootout with the Janjaweed, but not before killing or wounding a few dozen of the savage militia. The surviving Janjaweed then burn the village to the ground and move on, presumably to continue their genocide rampage across the Darfur landscape. The final scene shows the female member of the journalist team, Malin Lausberg, who had fled with most of the other reporters and AU soldiers during the Janjaweed attack, now return to the destroyed village the next day with a group of AU soldiers only to find everyone dead, including two of her colleagues.

"The previous convention's lack of Tejano representation fostered a perception that only newcomers to Texas were dissatisfied. The president of the Convention of 1832, Stephen F. Austin, traveled to San Antonio de Béxar to garner support for the changes the convention had requested. Austin found that the Tejano leaders largely agreed with the result of the convention but opposed the methods by which the resolutions had been proposed.  They urged patience; Bustamante was still president and would not look favorably on a petition from settlers who had recently sided with his rival, Santa Anna.As a compromise, the ayuntamiento of San Antonio de Béxar drafted a petition containing similar language to the convention's resolutions.  Following legal norms, they submitted this to Músquiz, who forwarded it to the Mexican Congress in early 1833.  At this time, the federal and state governments were in flux.  Bustamante had resigned the presidency in late December 1832 as part of a treaty to end the civil war.  There was no effective state government.  The governor of Coahuila y Tejas had died in September 1832, and his replacement, federalist Juan Martín de Veramendi, immediately dissolved the state legislature, which had centralist leanings.  Veramendi called elections to seat a new government in early 1833.  Due to the political uncertainty, Austin urged that the federal government be given several months to address the petition.  If no action was eventually taken, he advised that Texas residents would form their own state government, essentially declaring independence from Coahuila, if not from Mexico.Austin's timeframe was endorsed by Tejano leaders, but it did not pacify the Texian settlers.  Towards the end of December, the central committee called for a new convention to meet in San Felipe de Austin in April 1833.  Elections were scheduled for March.  This action disturbed the Tejano leaders, who saw it as a violation of their agreement with Austin.Communities in Texas elected 56 delegates for the new convention.  In a departure from the previous election, San Antonio de Béxar also sent delegates, including James Bowie, the son-in-law of Governor Veramendi.  Bowie, like many of his fellow delegates, was known as an agitator who wanted immediate change.

"The promotional clip for ""Something"" was shot in late October 1969, not long after Lennon had privately announced that he was leaving the band. By this time, the individual Beatles had drawn apart and so the film consisted of separate clips of each Beatle walking around his home, accompanied by his wife, edited together. Harrison's segment shows him and Boyd together in the garden at Kinfauns; in author John Winn's description, Harrison appears ""solemn"" while Boyd is seen ""smiling sweetly"" and ""sporting leather and fur coats"". Winn also comments on the attractiveness of all the wives in contrast to the unkempt appearance of McCartney, especially, who had sunk into depression at the realisation that the Beatles were over. The four segments were edited and compiled into a single film clip by Neil Aspinall. Writing in The New York Times following Aspinall's death in 2008, Allan Kozinn said: ""What Mr. Aspinall's idyllic film avoided showing was that the Beatles were at that point barely on speaking terms. In the film, no two Beatles are seen together.""In 2015, following restoration overseen by Apple's Jonathan Clyde, the ""Something"" promo film was included in the Beatles' video compilation 1 and its expanded edition, 1+.

"The story encompasses around nine characters portraying nine variants of emotion and an outdated dam.The story starts with Vinay, who is a mariner and works in ships. One day he visits his native place, somewhere in Kerala, with his son Sam to meet his father Shankaran. Shankaran is a village doctor or 'Vaidyan' and is also a master in astrology and the ancient sciences. Sam is a Diabetic and Vinay wanted to have him treated by his grandfather. Another story line is that of the orphan Meera, who has been staying with Shankaran since her childhood, treated as his own daughter and who helps him treat various patients. Vinay and Meera share a special bond and love each other. But when Shankaran studied their horoscopes, he learned that whenever they express their love towards each other, something terrible would happen. Learning this Meera sacrificed her love, and thus Vinay married Sandra who is a TV journalist. Now after a long time when Vinay returns home with his son, his special bond with Meera develops again with Meera reciprocating the feeling as well. On a parallel track, a corrupt Mayor - Durai (Ashish Vidyarthi)- is fighting an issue of an old dam in his area. Towards the end a leak is discovered inside the dam, and when a heavy storm and rains hit on the same day, a high alert is declared.",08e02e635aa74a9eeae75ecfb42391a9,Who is the Vaidyan's son?,Vinay,Sam,bert,c0b132d8cc41ff5dcf32c161b5fd8f8c,Who is Sam's father in love with?,Meera,"Meera sacrificed her love, and thus Vinay married Sandra",bert,2852db514a306d7239b0a59c94a2b23a,Who marries the mariner?,Sandra,"Meera sacrificed her love, and thus Vinay married Sandra",bert,d9df7dd7e20dc16832760efd45eaf6a0,Who marries the mariner?,Sandra,Vinay,bert,876f9ead76209615370afcf0a77617c3,Who is the Vaidyan's son?,Vinay,Shankaran.,bert,72ac663581cd62888d7b7b6386b3c4bf,Who is Sam's father in love with?,Meera,Shankaran.,bert,638317130bd58848df8dae46b1f95c73,Who is the Vaidyan's son?,Vinay,"Vinay, who is a mariner and works in ships.

"The story opens with Georges Iscovescu recounting his story to a Hollywood film director at Paramount in an effort to earn some quick cash. Georges is a Romanian-born gigolo who has arrived in a Mexican border town seeking entry to the US. He has to endure a waiting period of up to eight years in order to obtain a quota number, living with other hopeful immigrants in the Esperanza Hotel. After six months he is broke and unhappy. When he runs into his former dancing partner Anita Dixon she explains how she quickly obtained US citizenship by marrying an American, who she then, just as quickly, divorced. Georges resolves on the same plan. He soon targets visiting school teacher Miss Emmy Brown, who is in Mexico on a day trip with her class of about fifteen young boys. Georges manages to extend the time necessary to repair her broken down automobile.  Emmy and her pupils sleep in the lobby of the full-up Esperanza Hotel.  This provides Georges the opportunity to quickly and intensively woo Emmy in the early morning hours; she awakens to him sitting nearby and gazing at her lovingly. By claiming she is the exact image of the lost love of his life, his seemingly intense ardor toward a stranger is plausible, and they marry later that same day. However, George must wait some weeks before entering the US, and Emmy returns home with the boys.",bbfaa7a9e373a605fec339c47b181b5e,What is the last name of the person who is seeking entry into the U.S.?,Iscovescu,"Brown,",bert,84a9141e443336a56cb079625b6301e1,What is the last name of the person who sleeps in the lobby of the hotel?,Brown,Georges,bert,80d2d35d8bbdca16ad2417883db4cc81,What is the full name of the person who has to wait eight years for a quota number?,Georges Iscovescu,"Miss Emmy Brown,",bert,bfe2f16d7f052477ca46dee46cd94c44,What is the full name of the person that Georges marries?,Miss Emmy Brown,Dixon,bert,0e360c8446cabc893a172e979d0c3764,What is the full name of the man who plans to marry for citizenship?,Georges Iscovescu,Anita Dixon,bert,cfa54a60c4fabc1799792d27865181b2,What is the full name of the person who has to wait eight years for a quota number?,Georges Iscovescu,Georges Iscovescu recounting his story to a Hollywood film director at Paramount in an effort to earn some quick cash.

"The tracks ""Countdown"" and ""End of Time"" were distinguished by their musical and lyrical experimentalism. ""Countdown"" was described as ""everywhere on the genre map"", although predominantly dancehall-led with a ""bristling brass arrangement"". Its chorus describes a relationship by counting backwards from ten, using a sample from Boyz II Men's ""Uhh Ahh"". ""End of Time""'s pulsating, brass sound—reminiscent of a marching-band—was heavily influenced by Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti. Kuti's use of horns and percussion instruments was recreated and combined with elements of electronic music and synthesizers. ""Lay Up Under Me"" is also built on retro horns, featuring upbeat vocals, a sound Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork associated with Michael Jackson's 1979 album Off the Wall.Other tracks were noted for their retro stylization. ""Rather Die Young"" is a throwback to 1960s doo-wop and Philadelphia soul, with a slow tempo and modern drums. ""Party"" achieves a vintage aesthetic through minimalistic production, replete with heavy synthesizers and a 1980s smooth-funk groove. The song is unique for its conversation-like structure, in which Beyoncé and guest-vocalist André 3000 sing verses that allude to socialization at parties. Elements of Prince's style was found on ""Schoolin' Life"" and ""I Care"". ""Schoolin' Life"" is an uptempo funk song, with lyrics that advise the listener to live life to the fullest while cautioning them about the consequences of excess. The chorus of ""I Care"" was compared to ""Purple Rain"", with themes of sadness and resentment, the song uses soft background vocals and dense percussion. ""Love on Top"" was noted for its energetic key changes with a joyful tone, evoking the work of Michael and Janet Jackson.

"There is considerable uncertainty about the identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption of power in 1295. This is in part because the two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him. The Gediminid dynasty began its ascent in Lithuania during this time with the emergence of its first leader, Butigeidis. In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, he attacked Sambia. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in present-day Sovetsk (Tilsit) and their raids intensified. Butigeidis was the first to build strong castles along the Neman River. He died in 1290 or 1292, and his brother Butvydas (also known as Pukuveras) inherited the crown. Butvydas was the father of Vytenis and probably of Gediminas. During his short reign Butvydas tried to defend the duchy against the Teutonic Knights; he also attacked Masovia, an ally of the knights. His son, Vytenis, advanced to power in 1295 and ended the period of relative instability. His reign marks the transition from the state's establishment to the point at which it was poised for expansion.",0216b927507716bfe54caa2b0ec7128d,What is the alias of the person that inherited the crown from Butigeidis?,Pukuveras,Daumantas,bert,c5a09759e85e7ae05f55807776b24393,What did Butiegeidis attack?,Sambia,Bishop of Tver,bert,71f4e1e6fc329251904339bafaf1cc42,What was the full name of the person that was attacked in 1285?,Bishop of Tver,Daumantas as Grand Duke.

"Todd Acosta, his girlfriend Sarah Fletcher, and their new carpooling friends Jodi, Keren, Jeff, and Eric become stranded on a remote country road when their SUV suffers a tire blowout. While changing the tire, Jeff is suddenly killed by silent sniper fire. The unseen sniper shoots Sarah next, prompting Eric to take cover behind a tree stump while Jodi, Keren, and Todd hide behind the vehicle. The sniper shoots a cellphone off a selfie stick when the trio behind the vehicle tries getting a signal to call 911. Keren uses her hoodie to create a distraction while Todd, who is additionally suffering from a slug lodged in his arm, unsuccessfully attempts to put the SUV in neutral so it can be moved for rolling cover. Eric uses a video shot from his cellphone camera to determine the sniper's position. Todd retrieves a toolbox and duct tapes its metal lid to his arm for protection. Although he takes another shot in the process, Todd manages to get the SUV rolling on his second attempt. However, the SUV rolls in the opposite direction until the sniper shoots out another tire and disables it. Eric tries running toward nearby trees in the commotion. The sniper shoots Eric in his ankle as well as his leg. Eric hits the ground and eventually passes out. Keren uses a lighter to heat a hammerhead for cauterizing Todd's arm wound. After retrieving a water bottle from the backseat and taking swigs themselves, the trio tosses the bottle to Eric. The sniper shoots Eric through his hand when he tries taking a sip. During a quiet moment, Todd tells Jodi and Keren that his girlfriend Sarah was pregnant, but lost their baby. Lost in reflection and losing hope, Todd goes to drape a shirt over Sarah's face.

"Todd Acosta, his girlfriend Sarah Fletcher, and their new carpooling friends Jodi, Keren, Jeff, and Eric become stranded on a remote country road when their SUV suffers a tire blowout. While changing the tire, Jeff is suddenly killed by silent sniper fire. The unseen sniper shoots Sarah next, prompting Eric to take cover behind a tree stump while Jodi, Keren, and Todd hide behind the vehicle. The sniper shoots a cellphone off a selfie stick when the trio behind the vehicle tries getting a signal to call 911. Keren uses her hoodie to create a distraction while Todd, who is additionally suffering from a slug lodged in his arm, unsuccessfully attempts to put the SUV in neutral so it can be moved for rolling cover. Eric uses a video shot from his cellphone camera to determine the sniper's position. Todd retrieves a toolbox and duct tapes its metal lid to his arm for protection. Although he takes another shot in the process, Todd manages to get the SUV rolling on his second attempt. However, the SUV rolls in the opposite direction until the sniper shoots out another tire and disables it. Eric tries running toward nearby trees in the commotion. The sniper shoots Eric in his ankle as well as his leg. Eric hits the ground and eventually passes out. Keren uses a lighter to heat a hammerhead for cauterizing Todd's arm wound.

"Two aliens, Nukie and Miko, spend their time flying through space in the form of stars and looking for fun. The two come across the planet Earth and, while trying to survey the planet, get caught in its gravitational pull and end up crash landing. During the crash, the two are separated, with Nukie ending up in the African savanna and Miko falling into the hands of a Space Federation in the United States. Upon discovering Miko's crash site, the agency take the alien in to perform tests on him, while Miko cries out for Nukie. Miko reaches out to Nukie telepathically and informs him that he is being held captive in America. The head of the operation, Dr. Glynn sends Dr. Eric Harvey to Nairobi to investigate the other crash site. During their experiments, the scientists discover that Miko is a being made of pure energy. Nukie, meanwhile, begins to explore his surroundings, attempting to communicate telepathically with the animals he encounters to ascertain the location of America. The animals don't understand and – much to Nukie's frustration – run away. He then comes across two children, Tiko and Toki, who seem to be able to understand Nukie. He asks them for their help with finding America, but they run off vowing not to tell anybody about what has happened. In America, Miko is subjected to more painful testing to explore his physical makeup. Miko's brain patterns show images of the animals which Nukie sees, indicating that Nukie is transmitting his brainwaves to Miko. Nukie decides to rest in the shade of a tree, turning invisible as he does so. Tiko and Toki pass by and Nukie is awoken by a flock of birds, becoming visible once more.

"Two pairs of friends, Matteo and Francesca & Shary and Diego, decide to spend the summer together in a beach house at the foot of Mount Circeo. Matteo,  a psychologist, is married to Francesca with whom he has a five-year-old girl, Elena. Diego and Shary have a less stable relationship, having a son together, David, who attends college in the United States. David comes to Italy for the first time in five years to spend time with his family and celebrate his birthday. Upon David's arrival, he and Matteo begin to develop feelings for each other. Only Leonard, Shary's brother, who has returned from his travels around the world to spend some time with the two pairs, seems to sense what is happening. The balance of Matteo's marriage begins to crack, and the growing tension seems to corrode the two families. While the rest of the household is out preparing for David's birthday party, Matteo goes to David's bedroom, and they have sex.  When Francesca returns, she has no front-door keys and enters the house through a patio door into David's room where she finds the two men having sex.  She runs out, and Matteo runs after her.  She dashes around a corner and into the street where she is hit and killed by a car. Later, Matteo, Shary, Diego, and David are having supper. Shary asks Matteo accusingly where he was at the time of the accident, and the movie ends as he begins to cry from guilt.",564937d81471e8afbe2bb968799fc6a9,What is the name of the person who is hit and killed by a car?,Francesca,"David's room where she finds the two men having sex.

"Two songs, ""Kreuzberg"" and ""I Still Remember"", explore sexuality and homosexuality; the former is an account of promiscuity in the Berlin area of the same name, while the latter details an unrequited crush of a boy for his schoolmate.The leading track, ""Song for Clay (Disappear Here)"", was inspired by Less Than Zero, a novel by Bret Easton Ellis which depicts excessive hedonism and its effects on individuals. The song title references the protagonist Clay and a billboard in the book which displays the phrase ""Disappear Here"", while the action is relocated to Les Trois Garçons restaurant in Shoreditch, East London. ""Waiting for the 7.18"" provides an escapist counterpoint by mentioning a trip to Brighton following disillusionment with working life in the capital. The fifth song on A Weekend in the City, ""Uniform"", references London again and criticises the youth subculture in the area. It is directly inspired by Douglas Rushkoff's Merchants of Cool documentary, which details the corporate exploitation of popular culture by advertisement companies.Okereke read Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle and Henri Lefebvre's Critique of Everyday Life, works which analyse how people experience leisure in modern societies, and was inspired to pen several songs which detail the drug and drink culture present in a metropolis. ""The Prayer"" is based on drug use during nights out in clubs, while ""On"" specifies the effects and after-effects of cocaine. Okereke tried to treat the tracks as explanations of people's actions, rather than moralising tales; he has stated, ""In a time when so many people feel they can't communicate or feel hemmed in, I can see the appeal of cocaine."" ""Sunday"" details the morning-after hangover following a drunken and promiscuous night out, while ""SRXT"" takes the form of a suicide note following the loneliness and despair of hedonism in the metropolis.

"Unbeknownst to humans, there is a thriving, technologically sophisticated society of Martians living below the surface of Mars. The Martians Supervisor, while observing Earth, sees a mother persuading her son, Milo, to do his chores. The Martians decide to bring her to Mars, where her ""momness"" will be extracted and implanted into the next generation of nannybots. Meanwhile, Milo - who doesn't like following the house rules and doing chores and has been grounded as a result, tells his mother sarcastically that his life would be better without her, breaking her heart. Later that night, Milo goes to apologize, but discovers his mom is being abducted. He runs after her, but they end up in separate parts of the Martian spaceship. On Mars, Milo is taken to an underground cell. He escapes and is chased by Martian guards, but he follows a voice that tells him to jump down a chute, and lands in a lower subterranean level. There, he sees a trash-covered landscape that is inhabited by furry creatures. Milo is whisked away by the creatures to meet Gribble, a.k.a. George Ribble, the childlike adult human who had told him to jump down the chute. Gribble explains to Milo that the Martians plan to extract Milo's Mom's memories at sunrise, using a process that will kill her. Gribble, who is lonely and doesn't want Milo to leave, pretends to help Milo rescue his mother. His plan goes awry, leading to Gribble being captured and Milo being pursued by Martian guards. Milo is rescued by Ki, one of the supervisors who raise Martian babies. Milo tells her about his search for his Mom and what a human relationship with a mom is like, as Ki and her kin were mentored by only nannybots and supervisors and don't know of love.",9f233cfa774a1764b320e0a9d6db209b,What is the real name of the person Milo was whisked away to meet?,George Ribble,George,bert,e7075e4434b4f5901e24c403715c5272,What is the real name of the person Milo was whisked away to meet?,George Ribble,"Gribble,",bert,9bff188126026b4a2d2224160aba3938,Whose heart does Milo break?,his mother,a mother,bert,bd3b1a23f9b65affc966669e3dff4732,Whose heart does Milo break?,his mother,his mom,bert,0e8341c1a66241aa48a07983fa6527f8,What is the real name of the person Milo was whisked away to meet?,George Ribble,"Gribble, a.k.a.

"Valley View is a mid-19th-century Greek Revival residence and farm overlooking the South Branch Potomac River northwest of Romney, West Virginia. Valley View is atop a promontory where Depot Valley joins the South Branch Potomac River valley. The Valley View property was part of the South Branch Survey of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a large tract that was inherited by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, in 1719. It was settled by John Collins and his family in 1749, and acquired by the Parsons family before 1772. The Valley View house was built by James Parsons Jr. in 1855. After the Civil War, Parsons' widow sold the farm to Charles Harmison. His wife, Elizabeth Harmison, inspired by her childhood Virginia home, Western View, and the scenic South Branch Potomac River views, named the farm Valley View. The most recent of a series of owners, the Mayhew family, bought the property in 1979. Valley View's current proprietors, Robert and Kim Mayhew, have restored the historic residence and grounds. The house at Valley View is a two-story brick structure with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance is covered by a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear of the house, with a two-story wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements.

"Wallace was born in St. Mary's Hospital in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, on May 21, 1972, the only child of Jamaican parents, Voletta Wallace, a preschool teacher, and Selwyn George Latore, a welder and politician. His father left the family when Wallace was two years old, and his mother worked two jobs while raising him. Wallace grew up in Clinton Hill, on 226 St. James Place, near the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.At Queen of All Saints Middle School, Wallace excelled, winning several awards as an English student. He was nicknamed ""Big"" because of his overweight size by age 10. He said he started dealing drugs when he was around the age of 12. His mother, often away at work, did not know of his drug dealing until he was an adult. Wallace began rapping as a teenager, entertaining people on the streets and performed with local groups the Old Gold Brothers and the Techniques.At his request, Wallace transferred from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School to George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, where future rappers DMX, Jay-Z and Busta Rhymes were also attending. According to his mother, Wallace was still a good student but developed a ""smart-ass"" attitude at the new school. At seventeen, Wallace dropped out of school and became more involved in crime. In 1989, he was arrested on weapons charges in Brooklyn and sentenced to five years' probation. In 1990, he was arrested on a violation of his probation. A year later, Wallace was arrested in North Carolina for dealing crack cocaine. He spent nine months in jail before making bail.",5506d4d80e7d4f28d882199a5419f05c,What is the full name of the person that worked two jobs while raising Wallace?,Voletta Wallace,Selwyn,bert,c407e355ecfca7eea8cfcc9496d833c8,What is the full name of the person that left when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"George Latore,",bert,bf886198133cbf9cfab44e769d696bce,What is the full name of the person that left when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Latore,",bert,c72b3a196e6fe03bddb85db6a4a39d8e,What is the full name of the person that left the family when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"George Latore,",bert,4f8862cb4e9ad6b1cc6f05b40fcec2b5,What is the full name of the person that worked two jobs while raising Wallace?,Voletta Wallace,"Latore,",bert,c42c7f9043b8ab2fd34b247559ff6306,What is the full name of the person that left the family when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Voletta Wallace,",bert,bdb93d7705a7298fabf8d19ced51d742,What is the full name of the person that left when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Voletta Wallace, a preschool teacher, and Selwyn George Latore,",bert,15135d127212a2718921f229e40b681f,What is the full name of the person that left when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Voletta Wallace,",bert,d9abf27dc634c63763f9b2707da2d5ec,What is the full name of the person that left the family when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,"Voletta Wallace, a preschool teacher, and Selwyn George Latore,",bert,495a7273a9b0292b2ec391bbb29ec87f,What is the full name of the person that left the family when Wallace was two years old?,Selwyn George Latore,Voletta,bert,81fe06c6ff2bb8d6865d8bb99c318e79
"Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913–2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914–1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey. His father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member. In the early years of the Second World War, Waters' father was a conscientious objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz.Waters' father later changed his stance on pacifism, joined the Territorial Army and was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943. He was killed five months later on 18 February 1944 at Aprilia, during the Battle of Anzio, when Roger was five months old. He is commemorated at the Cassino War Cemetery. On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio. Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there. Waters' earliest memory is of the V-J Day celebrations.Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College) with Syd Barrett, while future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour lived nearby on Mill Road and attended the Perse School. At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND), having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation. He was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school's cricket and rugby teams. Waters was unhappy at school, saying: ""I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one ... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers.""Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his childhood in Cambridge, he met future Pink Floyd founder members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the University of Westminster) school of architecture.

"Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913–2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914–1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey. His father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member. In the early years of the Second World War, Waters' father was a conscientious objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz.Waters' father later changed his stance on pacifism, joined the Territorial Army and was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943. He was killed five months later on 18 February 1944 at Aprilia, during the Battle of Anzio, when Roger was five months old. He is commemorated at the Cassino War Cemetery. On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio. Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there. Waters' earliest memory is of the V-J Day celebrations.Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College) with Syd Barrett, while future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour lived nearby on Mill Road and attended the Perse School. At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND), having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation. He was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school's cricket and rugby teams. Waters was unhappy at school, saying: ""I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one ... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers.""Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his childhood in Cambridge, he met future Pink Floyd founder members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the University of Westminster) school of architecture.

"When American diplomat William Gridley arrives in London, he rents part of Carly Hardwicke's (Kim Novak) house from her and promptly begins to fall in love. Gridley doesn't know that many people think she killed her British husband, Miles Hardwick, because he has disappeared; but without a body, the police cannot do a thing.

"When Boston Blackie performs magic tricks at a Thanksgiving Day party for the inmates of a women's prison, Dinah Moran volunteers to enter a booth. She disappears after he draws the curtain, but as a former magician's assistant, uses the opportunity to escape. Police Inspector Farraday takes Blackie into custody as an accomplice, but Blackie easily gets away himself. A trip to the library reveals that Dinah was sent to prison for three years for a robbery that netted $100,000 (which was never recovered) and a dead victim. Her magician former husband, John Lampau, was acquitted. Blackie tracks Lampau down, still performing magic, but now under the name of Jani, to warn him. Dinah shows up minutes later, having heard that Jani intends to marry his new assistant, Irene. Dinah has come to make sure she gets her half of the loot. In a scuffle, she grazes Jani's right hand with a gunshot before fleeing. Blackie arranges to impersonate Jani, while the magician hides in Blackie's absent friend's apartment. That night, Blackie is awoken by sounds in Jani's apartment. When he investigates, a woman runs out of the unlit room.  Blackie eventually locates the money in Jani's safety deposit box and takes it, still disguised as Jani. Outside, Dinah forces him at gunpoint to give her the envelope containing the loot, but when she opens it, it is empty. Blackie had taken the precaution of pocketing the money. In the meantime, Blackie's friend returns home from a trip early and finds Jani's body in the closet. Farraday corners and arrests Blackie and his sidekick, ""the Runt"" (George E.

"When Brooklyn burlesque showgirl Maisie Ravier arrives at a small Wyoming town, she finds her new employer has folded after a single performance, leaving her stranded and nearly penniless. She persuades Rico to hire her for his midway shooting gallery. Her first customer is the unfriendly ""Slim"" Martin, the manager of a ranch. Slim accidentally drops his wallet full of money. Rico picks it up and leaves town. Slim has Maisie arrested for theft, but when a search finds she only has 15 cents, he admits his mistake. The deputy sheriff informs Maisie that as a vagrant, she must leave town by midnight, so she hides in the back of Slim's truck. When Slim returns to the ranch, he is displeased to discover the stowaway. He has Maisie driven to the railway station the next morning. Maisie meets the ranch owners, Cliff and Sybil Ames, who arrive on the train. Maisie fast-talks herself into being hired as Sybil's maid. The Ameses are trying to rebuild their marriage after Cliff discovered Sybil's extramarital affair with Richard ""Ray"" Raymond. Maisie's warm personality gradually overcomes Slim's hostility. Slim's demeanor is the result of past hard luck: he confessed to embezzlement to protect his girlfriend and spent a year in prison, only to discover after his release that she had run off with another man. Maisie also becomes friends with Cliff. Maisie and Cliff volunteer to drive needed supplies to the old ranch house but their car overturns and Cliff is pinned under the wreck. Maisie limps to the house and walks in on Sybil kissing Ray Raymond. Maisie sends the ranch hands to rescue Cliff, who is not seriously injured.",ef1d9f43b28b9cde7a36673cb3fa4d8e,What happened to the shooting gallery owner's girlfriend?,she had run off with another man,to embezzlement,bert,229703402d56bf68c60ed60efc3d741d,What is the original job of Sybil's maid?,burlesque showgirl,manager of a ranch,bert,56333a026a81d865c02337c192079d68,What is the original job of Sybil's maid?,burlesque showgirl,showgirl,bert,9da49e887402fc74633f999287656e82,What is the original job of Sybil's maid?,burlesque showgirl,midway shooting gallery,bert,4e1b5ba90226431a5f14821b64939289,What does the deputy sheriff call Sybil's maid?,vagrant,Maisie fast-talks herself,bert,e263e316cde9fc4082b7ace28bd0ab60,What is the original job of Sybil's maid?,burlesque showgirl,his midway shooting gallery,bert,8e2ec3ea1397f9ec140bfd4bdd2c84ac,What does the deputy sheriff call Sybil's maid?,vagrant,Maisie Ravier,bert,fb2aa081e61d244fd13f345aa6854386,What happened to the shooting gallery owner's girlfriend?,she had run off with another man,confessed to embezzlement to protect his girlfriend and spent a year in prison,bert,290b0b90444122538040a68b19ee7107,What does the deputy sheriff call Sybil's maid?,vagrant,"""Slim""",bert,450db88b760d049e4f8420f1bea2639d,What happened to the shooting gallery owner's girlfriend?,she had run off with another man,to embezzlement to protect his girlfriend and spent a year in prison,bert,94bc2205ea89254b730b42ce70178763
"When charter-boat skipper Jack O'Conner finds a gold Spanish dollar off the Florida Keys, he decides to go in search of a legendary hoard of Spanish doubloons sunk during the ""Hundred Years Storm"" of 1780. For, as Jack's friend Cap'n Billau reveals, the coin bears a clue to the treasure's whereabouts – one of four islands etched by the infamous pirate, Jacques Un-Oeil upon the original doubloon. At Billau's urging, Jack tracks down the two beautiful women who unknowingly hold the remaining clues. Streetwise Sandy Sequoia's piece of eight came from her murdered drug dealer boyfriend in Miami. And lonely-heart Portia Pennington inherited her coin from her merchant tycoon grandfather, who died at sea in the ""Hundred Years Storm"" of 1893, while hunting for the lost gold. Jack convinces the girls to go in search of the pirate treasure with him. But first, the two must learn to crew his 76' schooner; and then, all three adventurers must learn to trust one another, if they expect to navigate the treacheries of love and the unpredictable Caribbean. As Jack introduces the girls to life at sea, he starts to fall in love with Sandy. All seems to be going well, until Jack discovers Sandy with drugs on his boat – a kilo of her dead boyfriend's cocaine (which she has steadily been using since coming aboard). He has Portia dump the coke overboard; and while Sandy wrestles to overcome her addiction, Jack turns his attentions to Portia. When Sandy and Portia realize that Jack has seduced each of them in turn and convinced each to reveal to him the name of the island on her coin, they turn on him.

"When charter-boat skipper Jack O'Conner finds a gold Spanish dollar off the Florida Keys, he decides to go in search of a legendary hoard of Spanish doubloons sunk during the ""Hundred Years Storm"" of 1780.

"When the convention adjourned on April 13,  Austin went directly to San Antonio de Béxar to meet with Seguin.  Seguin called a series of meetings, held from May 3 to 5, for prominent locals to discuss the convention proceedings.  He was the only Béxar resident to fully support separate statehood.  Other residents suggested that the capital of Coahuila y Tejas should be moved to San Antonio de Béxar, giving Texas more power.  There was precedent for this; under Veramendi, the capital had just been moved from Saltillo to Monclova.  If the legislature rejected the move, these residents vowed to support separate statehood.A third group of residents believed that the convention, like its predecessor, was illegal.  Under their interpretation of the laws, only the state legislature would be able to petition the Mexican Congress for such a drastic change.  Austin argued that the laws really meant that no one could petition on behalf of the people unless the people had been consulted, and the convention served as that consultation.  The meetings ended with no agreement on how to proceed.  Austin wrote that ""the people here agree in substance with the rest of Texas, but differ as to the manner, and will express no opinion for, nor against"".Seguin declined to accompany Austin. Miller also withdrew.  Texas was in the throes of a cholera epidemic, and Miller, a physician, felt it his duty to stay and tend the sick.  Austin then visited Goliad but was unable to attract any more Tejano support.  He chose to go to Mexico City alone; he had visited several times and had established a good reputation among government officials.

"While Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate Henry Cobb had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. John Hancock Insurance chairman Robert Slater hired I. M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the Prudential Tower, erected by their rival.After the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the Trinity Church and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a ""background and foil"" to the older structures around it. When the Hancock Tower was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in New England. Serious issues of execution became evident in the tower almost immediately. Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. In response, the entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels. This significantly increased the cost of the project. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I. M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were ""not good and workmanlike"". LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I. M. Pei & Partners sued LOF in return. All three companies settled out of court in 1981.The project became an albatross for Pei's firm. Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in Australia and Pei took on jobs in Singapore, Iran, and Kuwait. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. ""Going through this trial toughened us,"" he said. ""It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other.""",47ca063faa09ec4a7d6f9ac40a1c9a38,Whose rival erected the Prudential Tower?,I. M.

"While Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve themes of sex and love. One of the Boys is a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences. Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life. The singer's fifth studio effort Witness is an electropop album that she described as a ""360-degree liberation"" record, with themes including political liberation, sexual liberation, and liberation from negativity. Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on love between teenagers; W described the album's sexual innuendos as ""irresistible hook-laden melodies"". Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.Perry describes herself as a ""singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star"" and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told Marie Claire: ""I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable."" Kristen Wiig commented that ""as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record."" According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, ""being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet."" The New York Times labeled her ""the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation"". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent ""clichés"". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, and Nicki Minaj.",a6d9fac8e10631dbb14994583676f0ab,What two types of music is Prism influenced by?,dance,pop music,bert,2aba1d8ba90770472b137f237fe6eb4e,What two types of music is Prism influenced by?,dance,pop,bert,58c1e15684f1b08bd5d31ac58711d64e,What was the name of Perry's fifth album?,Witness,"One of the Boys and Teenage Dream,",bert,ed95884240d3e88e92663dc93f46dee6,What are the name of the other artists who have recorded songs co-written by Perry?,Selena Gomez & the Scene,Selena,bert,ec8aed4434385860ed03bb0dd97588c5,What was the name of Perry's fifth album?,Witness,Teenage Dream,bert,d307ba649ca08e66973e0b2f63085052,What is the name of the magazine that Perry told that you become more relatable when you're vulnerable?,Marie Claire,Marie,bert,bf40321df61dd1a2cf32551ee8d83f32,What two types of music is Prism influenced by?,dance,dance and pop,bert,a36757c0ad533aa83d8cdebe392a811f,What two types of music is Prism influenced by?,dance,"dance and pop music.

"While cleaning one of his father's rifles as a birthday surprise, young Ed Jr. accidentally shoots his mother. Ed never forgives his son for this, and the two become estranged. Years later, while Ed and his friends are trying to think of something to do for their college's fall break, Big Ed calls, and demands Ed come to his beachfront condominium, and close it up for the winter. Ed's friends convince him to accept the job, and take them with him, so it will be finished quicker, and they can spend the rest of their break hanging around the condo. Ed's group arrives at the condo, which Big Ed is passed out drunk in the basement of, having dreams about killing his son. After dinner, everyone goes for a walk on the beach, and Mike and Linda go skinny dipping in the pool. Big Ed discovers the two, drowns Linda, and uses a trail of her and Mike's discarded clothes to lure Mike back to the condo, where he kills him with an outboard motor. A police officer stationed on the beach then stops by the condo, and is killed when Big Ed decapitates him with an axe. The others return to the condo, and as his friends get ready for bed, Ralph searches for Mike and Linda, and is killed when Big Ed impales him through the throat with a pitchfork. When Ralph does not return, Sue goes looking for him, and is caught by Big Ed, who stabs her in the crotch with a fishing gaff, and chops her head off. Ed and Pam find Sue's mutilated remains, and the bodies of the other victims, in the basement, and are attacked by Big Ed.

"While cleaning one of his father's rifles as a birthday surprise, young Ed Jr. accidentally shoots his mother. Ed never forgives his son for this, and the two become estranged. Years later, while Ed and his friends are trying to think of something to do for their college's fall break, Big Ed calls, and demands Ed come to his beachfront condominium, and close it up for the winter. Ed's friends convince him to accept the job, and take them with him, so it will be finished quicker, and they can spend the rest of their break hanging around the condo. Ed's group arrives at the condo, which Big Ed is passed out drunk in the basement of, having dreams about killing his son. After dinner, everyone goes for a walk on the beach, and Mike and Linda go skinny dipping in the pool. Big Ed discovers the two, drowns Linda, and uses a trail of her and Mike's discarded clothes to lure Mike back to the condo, where he kills him with an outboard motor. A police officer stationed on the beach then stops by the condo, and is killed when Big Ed decapitates him with an axe. The others return to the condo, and as his friends get ready for bed, Ralph searches for Mike and Linda, and is killed when Big Ed impales him through the throat with a pitchfork. When Ralph does not return, Sue goes looking for him, and is caught by Big Ed, who stabs her in the crotch with a fishing gaff, and chops her head off. Ed and Pam find Sue's mutilated remains, and the bodies of the other victims, in the basement, and are attacked by Big Ed. The two incapacitate Big Ed and try to drive away, but Big Ed jumps onto the car, and tries attacking them through the roof. Pam puts the car into reverse, and backs into a wall, crushing Big Ed into it, and cutting him in half at the waist. When a police car arrives, one of the deputies goes to inspect Big Ed's body, and has one of his legs sliced off when Big Ed springs to life. As Ed and Pam look on in horror, Big Ed finally dies laughing maniacally.",dfa7b18b81cadab9ef497f80331e2d40,What is the full name of the person Big Ed dreams about killing?,Ed Jr.,Linda,bert,9cfb8a17f69a4f0ec1461e0340b7a955,Who is stabbed in the crotch?,Sue,"Sue goes looking for him, and is caught by Big Ed,",bert,02e62b4889d1c9a2ac334196d9df9b46,What is the name of the last person Big Ed kills?,Sue,Mike,bert,863c5b458fb04b859157a909f099ba70,What is the first name of the person who kills Big Ed?,Pam,Mike,bert,07a2d3a372bd27235d5c8d67ab1d3926,What is the first name of the person who kills Big Ed?,Pam,"Mike and Linda, and is killed when Big Ed impales him through the throat with a pitchfork.

"William Etty was born in 1787, the son of a York baker and miller. He began as an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London ""with a few pieces of chalk crayons"", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters. He enrolled at the Royal Academy, and after a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. A follower of John Opie, who promoted the unfashionable painting style of Titian and Rubens over the then-prevalent formal style of Joshua Reynolds, Etty was unsuccessful in all the Academy's competitions and every work he submitted to the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in the 1810s was rejected. In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works in the Summer Exhibition, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). This painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received.",a6a9a704ed5f777c20cd6652af14f4be,What is the last name of the person whose intention was to become a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters?,Etty,Etty's,bert,113f651796bff80ee970c661aad351c5,What is the last name of the person who became well-respected for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones?,Etty,Etty's,bert,8034044319aab669f09651c6ef1ed2f6,What is the last name of the person who was admired by his fellow artists?,Etty,Etty's,bert,1bd97c58a691cc139f262c8374503270,What is the last name of the person who became well-respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting?,Etty,Etty's,bert,a78f4d64eecfbd436868dbe92130b394,What is the last name of the person who moved to London at the age of 18?,Etty,Etty's,bert,c4b11923b47af95c3ca318cee1126936,What is the last name of the person who began as an apprentice printer in Hull?,Etty,Etty's,bert,1fc60ef837a986dad5f220f9890c5ddc,What is the last name of the person whose repeated depictions of female nudity was condemned as indecent?,Etty,Etty's,bert,9f93803f05df901d30e5a45c4fa92568,What is the last name of the person who enrolled at the Royal Academy?,Etty,Etty's,bert,932e17820e1d79fa087d675d67a01d51,What is the last name of the person who studied under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence?,Etty,Etty's,bert,af54621c3bc74d08636e79eb85a70049,What is the last name of the person who completed his seven-year apprenticeship?,Etty,Etty's,bert,dd0423cb0377b84ae9c9a8cf952e16a7

"World-famous opera singer Alice Alquist has just been murdered at her home, No.9 Thornton Square. The perpetrator left without the jewels he sought after being interrupted by Paula, Alice's fourteen-year-old niece.  Paula was raised by her aunt following her mother's death.  After Alice is murdered, Paula is sent to Italy to train to become an opera star herself. Years later, an adult Paula meets and marries Gregory Anton after a two-week-long whirlwind romance.  Paula returns to London on his insistence, where she knows no one, to live in the long-vacant London townhouse of her deceased aunt Alice. To help calm her anxieties, Gregory suggests they store all of Alice's furnishings in the attic. Before they do, Paula discovers a letter in an old book addressed to her aunt by a man named Sergius Bauer.  Gregory's reaction is violent.  However, he dismisses his outburst as one of frustration at the bad memories his bride is experiencing. After Alice's belongings are locked away in the attic, events take a turn for the bizarre. At the Tower of London, Paula loses an heirloom brooch that Gregory had given her, despite its having been stored safely in her handbag. A picture disappears from the walls of the house; and Gregory says that Paula took it, one of many instances of her removing and hiding it.  But Paula has no recollection of having done so. Paula also hears footsteps coming from  the sealed attic, and sees the gaslights dim and brighten for no apparent reason. Gregory suggests these are in her imagination.",ebf683f81bbd0fd27aad302eda834408,Who is the man that has a violent outburst married to?,Paula,Paula discovers a letter in an old book addressed to her aunt by a man named Sergius Bauer.,bert,f9536ca30885f9d18d858168cf8501bf,What is the full name of the person that the woman who's mother died finds a letter addressed to?,Alice Alquist,Sergius Bauer.,bert,060147a6be84688ca43c332ce88fd63e,What is the full name of the person who raised Paula?,Alice Alquist,Gregory,bert,9f1a5a776e26d283c0987028f52f9625,What is the full name of the man that niece of the opera singer marries?,Gregory Anton,Sergius Bauer.,bert,495689098e85453a7b95338ff09c21c6,What is the full name of the man that niece of the opera singer marries?,Gregory Anton,Alice Alquist,bert,3d3b165bae34b35bcb69c20247c374da,What is the full name of the person who raised Paula?,Alice Alquist,Sergius Bauer.,bert,a0fd61130d9fcbc104e936c58d9002a3,What is the full name of the person that the woman who's mother died finds a letter addressed to?,Alice Alquist,Alice.,bert,dc9dc07242512c7d311c5e9cd54ba590,What is the full name of the person who raised Paula?,Alice Alquist,Anton,bert,988df3cfb58e08060dfaedc5cdc4550c,What is the full name of the person that the woman who's mother died finds a letter addressed to?,Alice Alquist,Gregory Anton,bert,ac8bc06895c471d06ccafc0d35a50e35,What is the full name of the man that niece of the opera singer marries?,Gregory Anton,Gregory,bert,ce41b24962910e9a2ff8827b998977ed
"Wormshill includes two farms: Yew Tree Farm (dairy farming) at the south end of the village, and Norwood Farm (fruit and other crops) at the north end. A third farm, Home Farm appeared on late 19th and early 20th centuries Ordnance Survey maps in the centre of the village. This farm is no longer in use, but some outbuildings remain. Wormshill at one time included a blacksmith's shop, which is recorded on Ordnance Survey maps until 1898.  According to the 1831 Census, 40 of the 48 adult males in the village were employed in the agricultural sector. Census records from the mid-to-late 19th century show a marked increase in the construction of new homes, representing the largest growth in the village for the next 100 years; however, the 1901 Census still described the majority of workers as ""labourers and servants"". The population spike between 1821 and 1901 is a trend typical to the general growth in the need for physical labour from parishes in the Kent downland agricultural region in the 19th century which was followed in the early 20th century by the increasing mechanisation of farming activity. Although the farms continue to employ from the village, as of 2008 Wormshill is largely a dormitory village, with residents employed in nearby towns or commuting to London. The socio-economic classification of Census 2001 indicated that the most common occupations were ""lower managerial and professional occupations"" (21.9 percent) and ""small employers and own account workers"" (15.2 percent).",7ff2d0a59566e1f301cff3a166668f41,What is the second most common occupation group for residents of the village that mostly commutes to London?,small employers and own account workers,lower managerial,bert,9f3e11ac87acfe2e96fdf764b25abc27,"What is the name of the farm where some buildings still exist, despite being closed?",Home Farm,"Wormshill includes two farms: Yew Tree Farm (dairy farming) at the south end of the village, and Norwood Farm",bert,6afbc22533e4acf8aa3437fbde8a8c32,What is the second most common occupation group for residents of the village that mostly commutes to London?,small employers and own account workers,lower managerial and professional occupations,bert,9cb19f350480b31e577cbb48e6b50be9,What is the second most common occupation group for residents of the village that mostly commutes to London?,small employers and own account workers,"lower managerial and professional occupations"" (21.9 percent) and ""small employers and own account workers",bert,06de15dfa10a897f29bde718372c1fb7,"What is the name of the farm where some buildings still exist, despite being closed?",Home Farm,"Yew Tree Farm (dairy farming) at the south end of the village, and Norwood Farm",bert,37dc5ef11e8f6b38c88eb6959b4a3891,"What is the name of the farm where some buildings still exist, despite being closed?",Home Farm,Norwood Farm,bert,d888842ad96e82a7f4b26e07bba3240d,"What is the name of the farm where some buildings still exist, despite being closed?",Home Farm,"Norwood Farm (fruit and other crops) at the north end.

"Young Judy Bellaire has trouble fitting in at school, causing trouble by introducing her jazzy style into music class and being expelled as a result.  Returning home to her dysfunctional and financially challenged family, where her playwright father, actress mother, and beautiful elder sister, Sylvia compete for attention along with the funny Russian maid, Olga and the hunky cook, Ricky, who is not-so-secretly in love with Sylvia.  Judy foils her father's attempt to ship her off to Europe by escaping from the ship and then trying out for a musical show as a blackface singer, taking advantage of her love of jazz to enchant the show's producer, who hires her and makes her a star of his new show.  Meanwhile, Ricky cuts a record, musically expressing his love for Sylvia.  Nevertheless, Sylvia is forced into engagement with another man.

Following his ""success"" at killing Zohan, Phantom opens a muchentuchen restaurant chain. After his arrival in America, Zohan befriends Michael by helping him against a bullying motorist, and is taken in by him and his mother, Gail. He also meets a fellow Israeli named Oori, who owns an electronics store, at a disco; Oori recognizes Zohan but vows to keep his identity a secret. After being refused by Paul Mitchell's and other hairstyling salons due to his lack of experience, Zohan is taken by Oori to an area in lower Manhattan populated with Middle Eastern immigrants, including Palestinians and Israelis. Zohan attempts to land a job in a struggling salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia.
