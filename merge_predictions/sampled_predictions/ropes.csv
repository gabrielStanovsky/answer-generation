"A After a rock forms, nuclei of a radioisotope inside the rock start to decay. As they decay, the amount of the original, or parent, isotope decreases, while the amount of its stable decay product, or daughter isotope, increases. By measuring the relative amounts of parent and daughter isotopes and knowing the rate of decay, scientists can determine how long the parent isotope has been decaying. This provides an estimate of the rock’s age.   Gregory is a geologist who went on an excursion to Australia. While hiking in a cave, Gregory found two radioactive rocks containing Uranium. Gregory then brought the rocks back to his lab in Germany to conduct tests. Gregory discovered that rock A had high amounts of the original uranium isotope present, and low amounts of the daughter uranium isotope present. In rock B, however, there were low amounts of the original uranium isotope present and high amounts of the daughter uranium isotope present.",389ec9d2de6dec7b9686635fdb7b0a90,"Which rock, rock A or rock B, had been decaying over a longer period of time?",rock B,"rock A or rock B,",bert,891adb69f5ad217fbb653cbdccaa7e48,"Which rock, rock A or rock B, had been decaying over a longer period of time?",rock B,A,bert,0f38680447370643f5d7d478caba4782,"Which rock, rock A or rock B, had been decaying over a shorter period of time?",rock A,A,bert,426c32ef0b2686f8f0aeba9c96d99572,"Which rock, rock A or rock B, had been decaying over a shorter period of time?",rock A,"rock A or rock B,",bert,325d75b2b73f049d0e791c928248f2dd,"Which rock, rock A or rock B, had been decaying over a shorter period of time?",rock A,"A or rock B,",bert,cb7c1d1b697d52433d04bb61212f25bd,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"A car’s gas pedal, like the one in Figure below , is sometimes called the accelerator. That’s because it controls the acceleration of the car.

Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force.   Eric is driving on a highway.

"A catalyst works by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products. The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier.

"A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection.

"A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

One adventure involves taking his family on vacation, and his son has been interested in seeing different formations of limestone.

"Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both.

People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration.

"According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential ""rogue planets"" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:   John is an amateur astronomer.

"Active immunity can also result from immunization. Immunization is the deliberate exposure of a person to a pathogen in order to provoke an immune response and the formation of memory cells specific to that pathogen. The pathogen is often injected. However, only part of a pathogen, a weakened form of the pathogen, or a dead pathogen is typically used. This causes an immune response without making the immunized person sick. This is how you most likely became immune to measles, mumps, and chicken pox.

Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do.

"All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure.

"All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure.

"Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05 mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0 mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l.During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.   Woodland had two nearby fish hatcheries. Pine hatchery had great result the past few years because they found a way to reduce ammonia water toxicity. Spruce hatchery has big ammonia toxicity problems and hadn't find a way to remediate them.",083461f51e3663360e59c6b5a99a57c6,Which hatchery found fewer fish with altered metabolisms?,Pine,Pine hatchery,bert,1fbfb495e19f629fe2e8642cfb820847,Which hatchery found fewer fish with altered metabolisms?,Pine,Spruce,bert,8d02441467bf00be2dc1f898812fb0d4,Which hatchery found fewer fish with an increased body pH?,Pine,Spruce,bert,37dc9d75d020a8f758ff472072ff9572,Which hatchery found fewer fish with an increased body pH?,Pine,Pine hatchery had great result the past few years because they found a way to reduce ammonia water toxicity.

"Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05 mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0 mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l.During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.   Woodland had two nearby fish hatcheries. Pine hatchery had great result the past few years because they found a way to reduce ammonia water toxicity. Spruce hatchery has big ammonia toxicity problems and hadn't find a way to remediate them.",621255bd4a0927d7e194f264114d70a5,Which hatchery found more fish with an increased body pH?,Spruce,Pine hatchery,bert,9612c09887ae0c53a307c88f13f0ec3b,Which hatchery found more fish with an increased body pH?,Spruce,Pine hatchery had great result the past few years because they found a way to reduce ammonia water toxicity.

"An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen . Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes.   A pharmaceutical company is trying to find the cure for allergy.

"An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure below . In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure below looks familiar to you, that’s because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure above . If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works.

"An enzyme is a protein that acts as a biological catalyst. Recall that a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being consumed in the reaction. Cellular processes consist of many chemical reactions that must occur quickly in order for the cell to function properly. Enzymes catalyze most of the chemical reactions that occur in a cell. A substrate is the molecule or molecules on which the enzyme acts. In the urease catalyzed reaction above, urea is the substrate. The Figure below diagrams a typical enzymatic reaction.

"Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.   John was studying the species in African Savannah.

"Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.   Nate and Andy were two zoologists. They have been studying the characteristics of nocturnal and diurnal animals.

"As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature.

"As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.

"As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid.

"As a star begins to run low on hydrogen, since the initial quantity has been fused into the denser helium gas, the core will contract due to gravity.

When that happens, the outer portion of the star expands greatly due to the higher temperature. The star can expand to 1000 times the diameter of the sun. At this point, the star is called a red giant . If our sun became a red giant, its surface would expand out past the orbit of Mars. Red giants are red because the surface of the star is cooler than white or blue stars, but remain highly visible because of their gigantic size.   John is an amateur astronomer. He recently found two stars, star A and star B. Upon observation, he figured out that star A is a blue star, but star B is a red giant. He had to do some research to find out the differences between them.",63b9e427fe7774f9541dde35b43d74b4,"Which star's surface would have higher temperature, star A or star B?",star A,star B?,bert,e2717cde9cb15a1c6fe4ce94b8c8bd6b,"Which star's surface would have lower temperature, star A or star B?",star B,star A,bert,3fc3cfa9c101bedd905cc27606c62670,"Which star's surface would have lower temperature, star A or star B?",star B,A or star B?,bert,1295ea0201a6fc2808694b4434067091,Would star A be less or more visible than star B?,less,less or more,bert,4ffb1dde03603fbf5d3eee8f121a2f8c,Would star A be less or more visible than star B?,less,less or,bert,58e0d49a5f98040fb8149af895a098e5,Would star A have greater or smaller diameter than star B?,smaller,greater,bert,e176bb3c24c013c3f1b1a7cf94ef6af8,Would star A have greater or smaller diameter than star B?,smaller,greater or smaller diameter than star B?,bert,d2da24ad49a048fe91253cbadf2a13f7,Would star B be less or more visible than star A?,more,or more,bert,8591e90b31a951e35454e0e234500c54,Would star B be less or more visible than star A?,more,less or more,bert,e87e60b9f1bed644d25f9c625e644e57,Would star B be less or more visible than star A?,more,less or,bert,02079424ce807075051ebd066b4934b6,Would star B have greater or smaller diameter than star A?,greater,smaller diameter than star A?,bert,1f016815331534a9f35e4622c608c617,Would star B have greater or smaller diameter than star A?,greater,smaller,bert,8626047316b3ad16bf12115d3ab69f9b,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"As the atoms first begin to interact, the attractive force is stronger than the repulsive force and so the potential energy of the system decreases, as seen in the diagram. Remember that the lower potential energy increases the stability of the system. As the two hydrogen atoms move closer and closer together, the potential energy continues to decrease. Eventually, a position is reached where the potential energy is at its lowest possible point. If the hydrogen atoms move any closer together, a third interaction begins to dominate and that is the repulsive force between the two positively-charged nuclei. This repulsive force is very strong as can be seen by the sharp rise in energy at the far left of the diagram.   Ken is a scientist who studies atomic systems. He is currently responsible for studying two systems that they are referring to as Omega and Alpha. These two systems are essential to the research that is being done to potentially allow humans to travel to Mars in a reasonable amount of time. Little is known about these systems currently, but scientists have observed that Omega has been steadily gaining more potential energy. Alpha has been rapidly losing potential energy. Ken is hoping to discern why this is happening and try to utilize his findings to further space exploration.",579f5f9d2b8d45851ec0b1c7ebb9bd1e,Which system is less stable?,Omega,Alpha,bert,58e07d87612a72bd1bd3c07c8012cdd3,Which system is less stable?,Omega,Omega has been steadily gaining more potential energy.

"Capital flight, in economics, occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an event of economic consequence.

"Capital flight, in economics, occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an event of economic consequence. Such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength.  This leads to a disappearance of wealth, and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country—depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime.  This fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also, their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods and acquire any form of foreign facilities, e.g. medical facilities.

"Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds.

"Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge.

Group A was domesticated and therefor never learned to communicate danger to each other. Group B was rescued from a bad storm but lived in the wild for years before they were captured then released. One day the two groups encountered a lion that was trying to eat them. One of the members of group B made a peculiar high pitched sound, alerting the rest of it's members that there was something dangerous nearby and they all went inside their burrow and hid.

"Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates.

Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms.

"Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

"Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects.

"Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues.

"For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp.

"Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B.   Two sexually active men are currently at the doctor getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases. Before performing the actual tests, the doctor takes a brief physical examination of the men. The doctor notices that Jake's heart is beating irregularly and his arm appears to have a rash on it. While examining Scully, the doctor takes note of how yellow Scully's eyes are, and Scully also reports to the doctor that he has been throwing up lately. After the physical, the doctor has the men both pee into a cup so that he can run a standard STD test for them.",fe76dc499a89f1bcf64b206b8ff4b443,Does Jake have a higher or lower chance than Scully of contracting liver cancer?,Lower,lower chance than Scully of contracting liver cancer?,bert,e66cdc70ed8c6af2423e5e21d74ebcbb,Does Jake have a higher or lower chance than Scully of contracting liver cancer?,Lower,higher,bert,e2a323b53c201d0f149d1aeb7d91840c,Does Scully have a higher or lower chance than Jake of contracting liver cancer?,Higher,higher or lower chance than Jake,bert,71e7a8e9daa4aa9fc8ce0e707025d917,Does Scully have a higher or lower chance than Jake of contracting liver cancer?,Higher,lower chance than Jake,bert,0ae5f78ae5adbb4425d9402df426c16d,Which man is less likely to have Hepatitis B?,Jake,Scully,bert,33ddf440f68099cdb22bd8db2124b6a3,Which man is less likely to have Hepatitis B?,Jake,"Scully's eyes are, and Scully",bert,10f32c1d0fd195047950e5d2b64f508b,Which man is less likely to have Hepatitis B?,Jake,"yellow Scully's eyes are, and Scully",bert,cf2793dabc2d8e3424755fcb58a6d5ca,Which man is more likely to have Hepatitis B?,Scully,Jake's,bert,b7e805c001a91113b8c3a6f22894b49e,Which man is more likely to have Hepatitis B?,Scully,yellow,bert,187daf961e017161f3f3f7f19f514b03,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"Human populations are on the rise. The human population passed the 7 billion mark in October of 2011, and will pass 8 and 9 billion probably before the middle of the century. All these people will need resources such as places to live, food to eat, and water to drink, and they will use energy and create waste. Essentially, human population growth can effect all other causes of extinction. For example, more people on the Earth means more people contributing to global warming and pollution. More people also means more clearing of land for agriculture and development. Recall that development by humans often causes habitats to be destroyed. This destruction can force species to go extinct, or move somewhere else.   There are two identical neighboring planets, Krypton and Gotham, inhabited by the same species of creature. Both civilizations utilize the same technology and have the same city structures. However, the creatures on Krypton use substantially more energy than the people on Gotham.

"Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes.

"If all other factors were the same, the highest temperature stars would also be the most luminous (the brightest). In the main sequence of stars, we see that as the temperature increases to the left, the luminosity also increases, demonstrating that the hottest stars in this grouping are also the brightest.

"In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.

"In deep water, particles of water just move in circles. They don’t actually move closer to shore with the energy of the waves. However, near the shore where the water is shallow, the waves behave differently. Look at the Figure below . You can see how the waves start to drag on the bottom in shallow water. This creates friction that slows down the bottoms of the waves, while the tops of the waves keep moving at the same speed. The difference in speed causes the waves to get steeper until they topple over and break. The crashing waves carry water onto the shore as surf.   Bob had seen the ocean before but only from the shore. He had always associated the ocean with waves moving towards him. Now he was on a boat for the first time he was awed by how still the water appeared to be.

"In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.   Two regions, region A and region B, shared a common border, a river. Region A was favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria, while region B was more favorable for the developement of Non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes.",a92c1dade9c969c55fb46ab4a5048165,Which region had more acetogenesis?,region A,"region B, shared a common border, a river.

"In the long term, the greatest changes in the Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages. As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter at a rate of ten percent every 1.1 billion years. In about 600 million years, the Sun brightness will have disrupted the Carbon Cycle to the point that trees and forests (C3 photosynthetic plant life) will no longer be able to survive and in around 800 million years, the Sun will have killed all complex life on the Earth's surface and in the oceans. In 1.1 billion years' time, the Sun's increased radiation output will cause its circumstellar habitable zone to move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life will be reduced to single celled organisms. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life. By 3.5 billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today.   Rob knows a brilliant scientist who has made a time machine.

"Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.   Bill and Jane are two farmers. They both had aphid infestation problems over the last few years, so Bill decided to use many types of insecticides in order to keep the aphids under control. He was only partially successful. Jane didn't do anything about it yet, because she has fewer aphids on her farm, but she vows to do so in the near future.",01fdab89605f782d1595749579bc3744,Which farmer had fewer aphids resistant to carbamates?,Jane,Bill decided to use many types of insecticides in order to keep the aphids under control.

"Matter, dark matter, and dark energy are distributed homogeneously throughout the Universe over length scales longer than 300 million light-years or so. However, over shorter length-scales, matter tends to clump hierarchically; many atoms are condensed into stars, most stars into galaxies, most galaxies into clusters, superclusters and, finally, large-scale galactic filaments. The observable Universe contains approximately 300 sextillion (3×1023) stars and more than 100 billion (1011) galaxies. Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million (107) stars up to giants with one trillion (1012) stars. Between the larger structures are voids, which are typically 10–150 Mpc (33 million–490 million ly) in diameter. The Milky Way is in the Local Group of galaxies, which in turn is in the Laniakea Supercluster. This supercluster spans over 500 million light-years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million light-years. The Universe also has vast regions of relative emptiness; the largest known void measures 1.8 billion ly (550 Mpc) across.   Rob is an amateur astronomer. He was looking at the sky with his telescope. First he took a longer length observation. He noted his observation as case A. Then he took a shorter length observation.

"Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases.

"Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts.   Scientists have recently discovered two organisms deep in a cave in the hills of Paris. One organism, Boncho, has many enzymes. The other organism, Hojo, has very few enzymes.

"Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry.

Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]   Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B took them to an ecological site where they wouldn't affect ground water and spread disease.",cca20b7b27e6b41da47d164dba873dc2,Which town is experiencing more child mortality?,Town A,"Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B",bert,ef2ac6c359ddc3b33c6e485c39ab5ad3,Which town is experiencing more child mortality?,Town A,town B,bert,58dc0a3bcfd8b8390a99ed7616b2d8e5,Which town is experiencing more child mortality?,Town A,B,bert,db85117fe353e5b1e46929f915ae3b47,Which town is experiencing more groundwater contamination?,town A,"A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B",bert,41cbc42520dc8454d1f069fedc47bbad,Which town is experiencing more groundwater contamination?,town A,town B,bert,b91439bdf9e444e439f464215d0de753,Which town is experiencing more mosquitoes?,town A,town B,bert,069ab3cf041562377976c3bfba41772b,Which town is experiencing more mosquitoes?,town A,"A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B",bert,68e35932310699cd0a2a85e7ff47f32e,Which town is polluting their groundwater less?,town B,Town A,bert,85d4199cce13fb9d37af1661ce172bd4,Which town is polluting their groundwater less?,town B,B,bert,add55ad5861a156ede58861fa7fee6f3,Which town is polluting their groundwater less?,town B,"A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B",bert,158ccf10ee6b0970679beb8706f583a8,Which town is polluting their groundwater more?,town A,town B,bert,cc4e76f8f335859a984ac2d5596f9a46,Which town is polluting their groundwater more?,town A,"A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B",bert,7bb6ba0bc1280e3b03d5ab40e073751f,Which town is polluting their groundwater more?,town A,"Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B",bert,49a4c60c0cac19375cab20e0cc0946fd,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behavior while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both spinning and fly fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases.   Jeff loves to go shad fishing. He prefers using fly fishing tackle and is planning a fishing trip up North with his buddies. They decided to take their trip in May when everyone can get off work over the Memorial Day holiday. Sam enjoys shad fishing as well, but the only time he and his buddies are able to take off work is during their slow season in March.",436f09a3b5a498bf4db4c5f0b6381ec7,"Who will have better fishing conditions and likely catch more shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam?",Jeff,Jeff or Sam?,bert,028b8d4cf8506985d0a875757847cd1e,"Who will have better fishing conditions and likely catch more shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam?",Jeff,Sam,bert,a80fbd8cb14d1c1b69880272d334c3d4,"Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam?",Sam,Jeff,bert,ec4a2a29cca55c2ad2c7aa0ca3f170c3,"Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam?",Sam,Jeff or Sam?,bert,dc9b659d5c25a736421f1d3833a017c9,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
"So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher.   Beach town was hit hard by the hurricane.

"Soil formation, or pedogenesis, is the combined effect of physical, chemical, biological and anthropogenic processes working on soil parent material. Soil is said to be formed when organic matter has accumulated and colloids are washed downward, leaving deposits of clay, humus, iron oxide, carbonate, and gypsum, producing a distinct layer called the B horizon. This is a somewhat arbitrary definition as mixtures of sand, silt, clay and humus will support biological and agricultural activity before that time. These constituents are moved from one level to another by water and animal activity. As a result, layers (horizons) form in the soil profile. The alteration and movement of materials within a soil causes the formation of distinctive soil horizons. However, more recent definitions of soil embrace soils without any organic matter, such as those regoliths that formed on Mars and analogous conditions in planet Earth deserts.An example of the development of a soil would begin with the weathering of lava flow bedrock, which would produce the purely mineral-based parent material from which the soil texture forms. Soil development would proceed most rapidly from bare rock of recent flows in a warm climate, under heavy and frequent rainfall. Under such conditions, plants (in a first stage nitrogen-fixing lichens and cyanobacteria then epilithic higher plants) become established very quickly on basaltic lava, even though there is very little organic material. The plants are supported by the porous rock as it is filled with nutrient-bearing water that carries minerals dissolved from the rocks. Crevasses and pockets, local topography of the rocks, would hold fine materials and harbour plant roots. The developing plant roots are associated with mineral-weathering mycorrhizal fungi that assist in breaking up the porous lava, and by these means organic matter and a finer mineral soil accumulate with time. Such initial stages of soil development have been described on volcanoes, inselbergs, and glacial moraines.   Ben and Jerry studied agricultural sciences.

"Some Chinese martial arts instructors focus more on their qinna techniques than others. This is one of the many reasons why the qinna of one school may differ from that of another.[2] All martial arts contain qinna techniques in some degree.

"Some processes in the body are regulated by positive feedback. Positive feedback is when a response to an event increases the likelihood of the event to continue. An example of positive feedback is milk production in nursing mothers. As the baby drinks her mother's milk, the hormone prolactin, a chemical signal, is released. The more the baby suckles, the more prolactin is released, which causes more milk to be produced. Other examples of positive feedback include contractions during childbirth. When constrictions in the uterus push a baby into the birth canal, additional contractions occur.   John is a doctor at the children's hospital.

The more the baby suckles, the more prolactin is released, which causes more milk to be produced. Other examples of positive feedback include contractions during childbirth. When constrictions in the uterus push a baby into the birth canal, additional contractions occur.   John is a doctor at the children's hospital. He had two different cases to investigate, case A and case B. In case case A, a baby continued to suckle mother's milk. But in case B, a baby stopped suckling mother's milk. He had to determine the different effects these two cases were causing.",d90548bb7cc5e1e55575b3d2fb6c4e52,"In which case less prolactin would be released, case A or case B?",case B,case A,bert,64b697a97991a0a65d8c461260bb2acb,"In which case less prolactin would be released, case A or case B?",case B,A,bert,5c10d052758e791c70ee93e351606f94,"In which case more milk would be produced, case A or case B?",case A,A,bert,3c0d7cd84e02287f2d245b2a6f4c6cc2,"In which case more milk would be produced, case A or case B?",case A,A or case B?,bert,d5fd5b4fcd45bb32956540f7d0bec975,"In which case more milk would be produced, case A or case B?",case A,case B?,bert,ef4983d3a92fd8e82ab9a5c3e2af033b,"In which case more prolactin would be released, case A or case B?",case A,case B?,bert,dc3d40ddc38d50813722300504da2688,"In which case more prolactin would be released, case A or case B?",case A,A or case B?,bert,99127a195140b8f7c0d42e1fb6c35343,"In which case more prolactin would be released, case A or case B?",case A,A,bert,8b1b5359780c37153812c4d94ea5bf00,"Which is an example of positive feedback, case A or case B?",case A,B?,bert,919a01f2521fb81098273ddb6daf5ede,"Which is an example of positive feedback, case A or case B?",case A,case A or case B?,bert,54e6dcc2ce284c385c928f9b667e525e,"Which is an example of positive feedback, case A or case B?",case A,case B?,bert,1cbd82eed06690242589362789d2c268,"Which is not an example of positive feedback, case A or case B?",case B,A or case B?,bert,49bf0e4f2c654a4314e389b5c6c1a9f4,"Which is not an example of positive feedback, case A or case B?",case B,case A or case B?,bert,a28eef01379be87e65751cd4ec4b306d,"Which is not an example of positive feedback, case A or case B?",case B,B?,bert,347384eb673d3aa3f844ddad2df4bb56,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"The Hubble space telescope shows that technology and science are closely related. Technology uses science to solve problems, and science uses technology to make new discoveries. However, technology and science have different goals. The goal of science is to answer questions and increase knowledge. The goal of technology is to find solutions to practical problems. Although they have different goals, science and technology work hand in hand, and each helps the other advance. Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space telescope. New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in new ways.

"The above example shows how science generally advances. New evidence is usually used to improve earlier ideas rather than entirely replace them. In this way, scientists gradually refine their ideas and increase our understanding of the world. On the other hand, sometimes science advances in big leaps. This has happened when a scientist came up with a completely new way of looking at things. For example, Albert Einstein came up with a new view of gravity. He said it was really just a dent in the fabric of space and time.   This year scientist found concrete evidence of existence of black holes by taking photograph of one.

"The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.   A species of animal called a markalong was discovered that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo.

On a recent deep sea dive, he discovered two new organisms. James took the organisms back to his lab to study them. While in the lab, each organism produced an offspring. Since the organisms were previously undiscovered, James must determine how these organisms reproduce in order to correctly classify them. After examining the DNA of each offspring, James finds that the offspring of organism A shares the exact same DNA as the parent organism and the offspring of organism B does not contain the exact same DNA as the parent organism.",a1437172f14315ab8daa1ec8c25c4845,Did organism A reproduce sexually or asexually?,Asexually,sexually or asexually,bert,218a42df9277ccce4c71222547239229,Did organism A reproduce sexually or asexually?,Asexually,ually,bert,f26dce6a1826949ad31b67c95369ec79,Did organism B reproduce sexually or asexually?,Sexually,sexually or asexually,bert,8475d632376141280f78e56a5086b777,Did organism B reproduce sexually or asexually?,Sexually,ually,bert,b78290d4a024c1e2cbdf010a9f605cda,Did organism B reproduce sexually or asexually?,Sexually,as,bert,d26ee51bcf0f80af3c7ac0b3fd21c4e6,"Which organism reproduced asexually, organism A or organism B?",Organism A,B?,bert,5e91d4f77b85eec71ad1e667504f95b3,"Which organism reproduced asexually, organism A or organism B?",Organism A,organism B?,bert,c7d30a46239aa631251bf1f580329c3a,"Which organism reproduced asexually, organism A or organism B?",Organism A,A or organism B?,bert,303262b3c1b4b3ffbed4615f13de8800,"Which organism reproduced sexually, organism A or organism B?",Organism B,organism A,bert,4f382669b01e29621ce80e2c6e59e5df,"Which organism reproduced sexually, organism A or organism B?",Organism B,B?,bert,a383e06c45268612faa92f7c68a4ec4a,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

"The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.   Students studied two groups of organisms. Group A composed of organisms that reproduce sexually, and group B composed of organisms that reproduce asexually.

"The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth.

"The first evidence of baking occurred when humans took wild grass grains, soaked them in water, and mixed everything together, mashing it into a kind of slippery and wet broth-like paste.[3] The paste was cooked by pouring it onto a flat, hot rock, resulting in a bread-like substance. Later, when humans mastered fire, the paste was roasted on hot embers, which made bread-making easier, as it could now be made any time fire was created. The world's oldest oven was discovered in Croatia in 2014 dating back 6500 years ago. The Ancient Egyptians baked bread using yeast, which they had previously been using to brew beer.[4] Bread baking began in Ancient Greece around 600 BC, leading to the invention of enclosed ovens.[4] ""Ovens and worktables have been discovered in archaeological digs from Turkey (Hacilar) to Palestine (Jericho) and date back to 5600 BC.""[5]   Students learned about bread making in school, and were fascinated by the history of bread.

"The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted.

"The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.   Bob is a financial analyst. He used to work for company A. Bob noticed that company A is mostly financed by debt. Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A.

The types of strong bond differ due to the difference in electronegativity of the constituent elements. A large difference in electronegativity leads to more polar (ionic) character in the bond.

"What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.

"What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law.
