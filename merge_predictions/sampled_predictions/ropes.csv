"A car’s gas pedal, like the one in Figure below , is sometimes called the accelerator. That’s because it controls the acceleration of the car. Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force.   Jordan and Alejandro are drivers currently in an intense car race. Some dust blows into Jordan's car, causing him to sneeze and take his foot off of the gas pedal. At the same time, Alejandro gets a burst of adrenaline and presses down  very hard on the gas pedal in his car.",14ce06004ccc19bdbb18da8ac67054a9,Who will cause their car to increase in speed?,Alejandro,Jordan's,bert,c16c7a1abb204c8aea10a6e253e9702f,"Will both of their cars be accelerating, yes or no?",yes,no,bert,c1a48f109fd9ffe4ceae8d1728da4ad3,Who will provide their car with more gas?,Alejandro,Alejandro are drivers currently in an intense car race.

"A catalyst works by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products. The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier.   A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change.

An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

"A related herpes virus causes cold sores on the lips ( Figure below ). Both viruses cause painful blisters. In the case of genital herpes , the blisters are on the penis or around the vaginal opening. The blisters go away on their own, but the virus remains in the body. The blisters may come back repeatedly, especially when a person is under stress. There is no cure for genital herpes. But drugs can help prevent or shorten outbreaks. Researchers are trying to find a vaccine to prevent genital herpes.   Mark noticed that he had a painful blister on his mouth again. Mark frequently got cold sores when he was under a lot of stress.

"Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well.   Johnny is playing with a toy train set his parents bought him. The controls for this train set allow him to make it go faster or slower and it even has a rail switch to make it travel on different tracks branching off to the left or right.",b075ab332db8ede8af259991f5bdd80a,"Will making the train switch to a different track be considered acceleration, yes or no.",yes,faster,bert,69d6813c01d9f792d0f837b0dda7a6ae,Will Johnny using the rail switch be an example of a change in direction or a change in speed?,direction,faster,bert,98aea72f9fe9c4714ac57bac65ed50b8,"Given Johnny decides to make the train accelerate and change tracks, will the velocity of the train increase or decrease?",increase,increase or decrease,bert,40812433cb45a83bd10d602e4d79f27b,"Given Johnny decides to make the train accelerate and change tracks, will the velocity of the train increase or decrease?",increase,decrease,bert,b6f6d0fc5e8896c24e0f91df197b86a2,Will Johnny using the rail switch be an example of a change in direction or a change in speed?,direction,faster or slower,bert,3bc09dbfc9fbfca09ee55fb2a65a0fcb,"Given Johnny decides to slow the train down, will this be an example of acceleration or deceleration?",deceleration,ration,bert,75b61210bb375168a0b3f7559c6e0796,"Given Johnny decides to make the train accelerate and change tracks, will the velocity of the train increase or decrease?",increase,will the velocity of the train increase,bert,2cdcbbbbe8ae3c460a156921bb073fb2,Will Johnny using the rail switch be an example of a change in direction or a change in speed?,direction,change,bert,b531627905259270b085f1077ba81135,"Will making the train switch to a different track be considered acceleration, yes or no.",yes,no,bert,a7fca1a6cc1cd34eef0ef07a48aaf18e,"Given Johnny decides to slow the train down, will this be an example of acceleration or deceleration?",deceleration,acceleration or deceleration,bert,5c1fb07363fb8e1235a21dec78a120b9
"According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential ""rogue planets"" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity.

Immunization is the deliberate exposure of a person to a pathogen in order to provoke an immune response and the formation of memory cells specific to that pathogen. The pathogen is often injected. However, only part of a pathogen, a weakened form of the pathogen, or a dead pathogen is typically used. This causes an immune response without making the immunized person sick.

"Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.

"All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire.   Beth was finally done making spaghetti sauce. Now she just need to put it all in jars.

"All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space.

"Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05 mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0 mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l.During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.   Woodland had two nearby fish hatcheries.

"Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.   John was studying the species in African Savannah.

"As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.

"As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature.

"As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid.

"As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid.   Sarah is cooking dinner for her husband's parents and puts two pots of water on the stove to boil. She turns the heat on pot A to high, but forgets to turn on the heat for pot B. Eventually, pot A begins to boil but pot B is still room-temperature.",7c558539d0cdc7066e57d1de35cfbbc6,Is the rate of evaporation higher in pot A or pot B?,Pot A,B?,bert,24473a46b56cc849ac98928248d67caf,Is the rate of evaporation lower in pot A or pot B?,Pot B,A,bert,11d7e5b5c51a0ae4a47bbc7a379d6b12,Does pot B have more or less average kinetic energy than pot A?,Less,less average kinetic energy than pot A?,bert,910310f3717f4382b71b8a0fbd145aa5,Does pot A have more or less average kinetic energy than pot B?,More,more or less,bert,60a6ee1f110d3b5df1c6a427eee1488a,"Which pot has a greater average kinetic energy, pot A or pot B?",Pot A,pot B?,bert,20338bd218921eff9d45495ad068a2de,Is the rate of evaporation higher in pot A or pot B?,Pot A,A,bert,1a783be61620efc8b7b87036b17cac88,"Which pot has a lower average kinetic energy, pot A or pot B?",Pot B,pot A or pot B?,bert,f6f105b7873b352d2af2aea59116ac63,Is the rate of evaporation higher in pot A or pot B?,Pot A,pot B?,bert,514f7ffc615f7b788c3a7fc6667e1251,Does pot A have more or less average kinetic energy than pot B?,More,less,bert,2adadc55407afd1d62717fdae0da5b5e,Is the rate of evaporation lower in pot A or pot B?,Pot B,pot A or pot B?,bert,71eab3221a3b8ce5f7ee58bbcb568865
"As a star begins to run low on hydrogen, since the initial quantity has been fused into the denser helium gas, the core will contract due to gravity. The collapsing core increases temperature to the point that the star can begin to fuse helium into carbon. When that happens, the outer portion of the star expands greatly due to the higher temperature. The star can expand to 1000 times the diameter of the sun. At this point, the star is called a red giant . If our sun became a red giant, its surface would expand out past the orbit of Mars. Red giants are red because the surface of the star is cooler than white or blue stars, but remain highly visible because of their gigantic size.

"Capital flight, in economics, occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an event of economic consequence. Such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength.  This leads to a disappearance of wealth, and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country—depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime.  This fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also, their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods and acquire any form of foreign facilities, e.g. medical facilities.   As an economist Dan is interested in economies of South America. He has extensively studied two countries, Venezuela and Bolivia.

"Capital flight, in economics, occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an event of economic consequence. Such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength.  This leads to a disappearance of wealth, and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country—depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime.  This fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also, their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods and acquire any form of foreign facilities, e.g. medical facilities.

Luckily, he has invented a device that allows him to analyze far away planets from the comfort of his own home.

"Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.

"Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds.

"Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction.

"Collision theory tells us that molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place. All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction.

Food preparers who are infected with parasites can also contaminate food if they do not thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom and before handling food. Trichinella is a type of roundworm parasite. People may be infected with this parasite by consuming raw or undercooked pork or wild game.   Two sisters attended a wedding.

"Communication is any way that animals share information. Many animals live in social groups. For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict. Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators. It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring. In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing.   Evey body knows that peacocks are beautiful birds with their long colorful tail feathers.

"Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms.

"During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina.

"Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation.

"Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues.

"Extending the period of time over which a force acts in order to lessen the force is a common practice in design. Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time.

"For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat.   Customers bought two types of electrical ovens, type A and type B.

"For example, your body has an internal thermostat. During a winter day, in your house a thermostat senses the temperature in a room and responds by turning on or off the heater. Your body acts in much the same way. When body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the brain sense the temperature change. The temperature change triggers a command from the brain. This command can cause several responses. If you are too hot, the skin makes sweat and blood vessels near the skin surface dilate. This response helps decrease body temperature.

"Human populations are on the rise. The human population passed the 7 billion mark in October of 2011, and will pass 8 and 9 billion probably before the middle of the century. All these people will need resources such as places to live, food to eat, and water to drink, and they will use energy and create waste. Essentially, human population growth can effect all other causes of extinction. For example, more people on the Earth means more people contributing to global warming and pollution. More people also means more clearing of land for agriculture and development. Recall that development by humans often causes habitats to be destroyed. This destruction can force species to go extinct, or move somewhere else.   There are two identical neighboring planets, Krypton and Gotham, inhabited by the same species of creature. Both civilizations utilize the same technology and have the same city structures. However, the creatures on Krypton use substantially more energy than the people on Gotham. Furthermore, the inhabitants of Krypton have started clearing more land than Gotham.",ea9c64c3c608f40b3e0c687a89525091,Which planet has a smaller population?,Gotham,"Gotham.

"Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes.

"In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals.

"In deep water, particles of water just move in circles. They don’t actually move closer to shore with the energy of the waves. However, near the shore where the water is shallow, the waves behave differently. Look at the Figure below . You can see how the waves start to drag on the bottom in shallow water. This creates friction that slows down the bottoms of the waves, while the tops of the waves keep moving at the same speed. The difference in speed causes the waves to get steeper until they topple over and break. The crashing waves carry water onto the shore as surf.   Bob had seen the ocean before but only from the shore. He had always associated the ocean with waves moving towards him. Now he was on a boat for the first time he was awed by how still the water appeared to be.

"In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems.

"In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.

"In the long term, the greatest changes in the Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages. As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter at a rate of ten percent every 1.1 billion years. In about 600 million years, the Sun brightness will have disrupted the Carbon Cycle to the point that trees and forests (C3 photosynthetic plant life) will no longer be able to survive and in around 800 million years, the Sun will have killed all complex life on the Earth's surface and in the oceans. In 1.1 billion years' time, the Sun's increased radiation output will cause its circumstellar habitable zone to move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life will be reduced to single celled organisms. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life. By 3.5 billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today.   Rob knows a brilliant scientist who has made a time machine.

"Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel.   Two ladies sit in a coffee shop.

"Matter, dark matter, and dark energy are distributed homogeneously throughout the Universe over length scales longer than 300 million light-years or so. However, over shorter length-scales, matter tends to clump hierarchically; many atoms are condensed into stars, most stars into galaxies, most galaxies into clusters, superclusters and, finally, large-scale galactic filaments. The observable Universe contains approximately 300 sextillion (3×1023) stars and more than 100 billion (1011) galaxies. Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million (107) stars up to giants with one trillion (1012) stars. Between the larger structures are voids, which are typically 10–150 Mpc (33 million–490 million ly) in diameter. The Milky Way is in the Local Group of galaxies, which in turn is in the Laniakea Supercluster. This supercluster spans over 500 million light-years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million light-years. The Universe also has vast regions of relative emptiness; the largest known void measures 1.8 billion ly (550 Mpc) across.   Rob is an amateur astronomer.

"Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts.   Mark is a biologist.

"Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%).

"One possible answer is that helping others often means helping close relatives. Close relatives share many of the same genes that they inherited from their common ancestor. As a result, helping a close relative may actually increase the chances that copies of one’s own genes will be passed to the next generation. In this way, a behavior that puts oneself at risk could actually increase through natural selection. This form of natural selection is called kin selection .

"Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations under control. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. Protozoa are also important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.

"So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher.   Beach town was hit hard by the hurricane.

"So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge.

"Soil formation, or pedogenesis, is the combined effect of physical, chemical, biological and anthropogenic processes working on soil parent material. Soil is said to be formed when organic matter has accumulated and colloids are washed downward, leaving deposits of clay, humus, iron oxide, carbonate, and gypsum, producing a distinct layer called the B horizon. This is a somewhat arbitrary definition as mixtures of sand, silt, clay and humus will support biological and agricultural activity before that time. These constituents are moved from one level to another by water and animal activity. As a result, layers (horizons) form in the soil profile. The alteration and movement of materials within a soil causes the formation of distinctive soil horizons. However, more recent definitions of soil embrace soils without any organic matter, such as those regoliths that formed on Mars and analogous conditions in planet Earth deserts.An example of the development of a soil would begin with the weathering of lava flow bedrock, which would produce the purely mineral-based parent material from which the soil texture forms. Soil development would proceed most rapidly from bare rock of recent flows in a warm climate, under heavy and frequent rainfall. Under such conditions, plants (in a first stage nitrogen-fixing lichens and cyanobacteria then epilithic higher plants) become established very quickly on basaltic lava, even though there is very little organic material. The plants are supported by the porous rock as it is filled with nutrient-bearing water that carries minerals dissolved from the rocks. Crevasses and pockets, local topography of the rocks, would hold fine materials and harbour plant roots. The developing plant roots are associated with mineral-weathering mycorrhizal fungi that assist in breaking up the porous lava, and by these means organic matter and a finer mineral soil accumulate with time. Such initial stages of soil development have been described on volcanoes, inselbergs, and glacial moraines.   Ben and Jerry studied agricultural sciences.

"Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur. They are called beneficial mutations . They lead to new versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to changes in their environment. Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to occur.

"Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since:   John was studying the history of dinosaurs. He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B.

"The Hubble space telescope shows that technology and science are closely related. Technology uses science to solve problems, and science uses technology to make new discoveries. However, technology and science have different goals. The goal of science is to answer questions and increase knowledge. The goal of technology is to find solutions to practical problems. Although they have different goals, science and technology work hand in hand, and each helps the other advance. Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space telescope. New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in new ways.   Stan Lawson is a biologist who studies marine life and has been keeping hand written notes for many years on experiments that he has performed. Jack Smith is an inventor and engineer who wants to create a new type of plastic companies can use that won't harm the ocean.

"The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased.

"The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape.

"The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.   Humans have just discovered the ability to asexually reproduce if they wish. Some people choose to use this option, but others still sexually reproduce. Billy was born by asexual reproduction and his parent has a genetic disease called Horkrumatis.

"The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low.

"The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.

"The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt.

The types of strong bond differ due to the difference in electronegativity of the constituent elements. A large difference in electronegativity leads to more polar (ionic) character in the bond.   Frank is studying covalent bonds in his chemistry class. He is trying to determine the polarity of different types of bonds. He has observed that bond A has a larger difference in electronegativity than bond B.,9e746d52f629e74b77c70c5324afb00a,Is bond B more or less polar than bond A?,Less,more or less polar,bert,c0ee850d79d90ab8160f47f3bcaf1c0d,Is bond B more or less polar than bond A?,Less,less polar,bert,787bef2630baf452fe86b72cbca60f18,"Which bond is less polar, bond A or bond B?",Bond B,bond A or bond B?,bert,a06528d965a72148ea35804b1529074b,Is bond A more or less polar than bond B?,More,more or less,bert,8cc3c9843f3a1d4fe2748496f130997f,"Which bond is less polar, bond A or bond B?",Bond B,bond A,bert,b2b3ad54bd31b536ce11cf9f43ae8cc1,"Which bond is more polar, bond A or bond B?",Bond A,bond A or bond B?,bert,075092bd5a59962fd35f957d909d5984,Is bond A more or less polar than bond B?,More,less polar,bert,3e02c0dd122f9651195fc16e8b1539b8,Is bond A more or less polar than bond B?,More,more or less polar,bert,c08d84df8711869c0a63edbd33fd4be9,"Which bond is more polar, bond A or bond B?",Bond A,bond B?,bert,f48f9937856390cac8708f499a9fd1e7,Is bond B more or less polar than bond A?,Less,more or less,bert,a3e13052364a754af45cd228bb58eb0f

"Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]   Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake.

"What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.

"What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.   Ryan and Krista are both traveling from Ohio to Florida. Ryan doesn't like to fly in airplanes, so he decides to drive. Krista prefers less travel time, so she chooses to fly. Since Ryan is staying on the ground, the air pressure around him will remain constant throughout his trip. On the other hand, Krista will experience a change in air pressure from high pressure to low pressure as the plane ascends.",aa6835491bd23fe66b488cf90b95d441,"Who is least likely to experience popping in their ears, Ryan or Krista?",Ryan,ta,bert,1d3d032819f66e0e5ac7f1a6ad4e3828,Is Krista more or less likely than Ryan to experience popping in her ears?,More,more or less likely,bert,7e07b53e9cfe17203df470fb07548a15,"Who is more likely to experience popping in their ears, Ryan or Krista?",Krista,Ryan or Krista?,bert,77ff317384117424c199d6085330ab5f,"Who is more likely to experience popping in their ears, Ryan or Krista?",Krista,ta,bert,8fcdd34b103e17aec1e34474e0431d4c,"Who is least likely to experience popping in their ears, Ryan or Krista?",Ryan,Ryan or Krista?,bert,66f5bc868dfd3c6b2bf785888df402e5,Is Krista more or less likely than Ryan to experience popping in her ears?,More,less likely,bert,ce94e9310185e0b5555e90766bb0745e,"Who is more likely to experience popping in their ears, Ryan or Krista?",Krista,Ryan,bert,eaebd2ec4ada47490f34d1afbeec7733,Is Ryan more or less likely than Krista to experience popping in his ears?,Less,more or less,bert,a45d5c310a04659252245fb57f2c0d58,"Who is least likely to experience popping in their ears, Ryan or Krista?",Ryan,Krista,bert,3ee7337ee4a8788df5c66b29f2b13337,Is Krista more or less likely than Ryan to experience popping in her ears?,More,more or less,bert,1ae47ab3fb318f9b21b60814d40766ed

"While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds.

Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred.   Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather.
