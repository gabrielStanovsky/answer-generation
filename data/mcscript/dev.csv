"This past weekend, my family made so much food that there was still plenty of it going into the week. Knowing this, we chose not to make any new food, because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend. All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top. The stove is a gas stove, which produces a flame that, in my opinion, cooks food much better than an electric stove. On Monday after getting home from work, rather than making a new meal, my mom took some of the food that we had saved from the weekend and put it into a pan, and put that pan on the stove. She turned the gas on until the burner ignited, and left the heat on until she felt that the food was warm enough. When she ate it, she swore it was as good as it was when it was freshly made.

"I was excited to go to the museum and learn more about history. I waited in line with the other people wanting to go in, and when it was my turn I paid for my ticket and then went inside. There was so much to see! There was a room about different kinds of rocks and where they came from. Another part of the museum had skeletons from all different kinds of old animals--dinosaurs, a sabretooth tiger, and even a mammoth! The plaques next to them told me all about when and where the animals lived. While I was at the museum, I moved from one room to the next and took my time to read as much as I could so I could really enjoy the trip. I spent all day learning about natural history, and there were still things I didn't get to see so I planned to return to the museum as soon as I could. It was a wonderful day!

"Time to make breakfast! I'll get the coffee started because it will be the perfect temperature by the time all the food is done. I grind the beans and put filtered water into the electric kettle and get it started. I need to put a filter in the Chemex and pour in my ground coffee beans. Meanwhile, I'll gather my ingredients from the fridge. I want eggs, butter, English Muffins, and Canadian bacon. A breakfast sandwich sounds good. I'll get the English muffins toasted in the toaster. My water just finished boiling, so it's time to pour that in the Chemex over the ground beans. I need to get the frying pan and put a little butter in there and turn on the pan. I grab and egg and scramble with a fork. My pan is heating and the butter is melting I put my egg in and swirl it to cover the bottom of the pan. While I wait for my eggs to set up, I'm going to microwave my Canadian bacon. Back to the eggs, they are almost set so I'll fold them into a half circle and flip.

I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire. Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry. I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs. Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper. I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it. When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs. As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning. I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on them.

"First I go to the store and buy bread.  For the freshest bread, I get a whole loaf and bring it home to slice it there.  I use a bread knife which makes cutting it easier, and cut off just what I need for the toast, leaving the rest whole.  I wrap and store the remaining loaf for next time.  Then I get the toaster out of the cabinet and place it on the counter, then plug it in. I choose the darkness of the bread - not too dark, somewhere in the middle for flavor and safety - then indicate the slice thickness using the knob on the toaster. I place the first two slices of bread in the slots and press down on the big button, which causes the bread to drop in and the toaster to get very hot. The timer counts down and I pay attention to it carefully, making sure the toast pops up and the toaster turns off.  I unplug it immediately but let it cool down before putting it away as it is very hot.  I butter the bread using a knife and then put away the knives and butter.

"I like to ride on trains because you can see lots of countryside without having to worry about driving . One time , when I lived in Alaska , I rode on a train from Fairbanks to Denali park . Just like with all train rides , I had to buy a ticket first and then I had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station . Then I climbed onto the train and picked a seat . The different places you can sit in a train are called cars . You do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit . So , I picked one in a car in the back and sat right beside the window . After the train started moving , a train attendant walked through to check our tickets and then I stood up to walk around . You can walk from car to car on a train and can even go out of the back of the very last car and stand outside , so I did that . It was very fun to be standing outside while the train was moving and I hung onto the railing to be sure I was safe . Then I went back inside and went to the dining car where I bought a sandwich and water . After I got back to my seat , I ate and watched the scenery through the window . I saw lots of interesting things including a moose and we arrived at Denali right after that . Were they traveling by themselves?","I like to ride on trains because you can see lots of countryside without having to worry about driving .

"I miss my best friend Shelly and so I decided to send her a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister’s house in Alaska, and to also tell her that I hoped she was well. I finished writing my letter and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send it, I had found that I did not have any. I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes, and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail my letter in.  After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers, and chose a heart design that I liked. I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to. When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly’s name and address in the middle, and wrote my sister’s address in the top left corner of the envelope. I stuck the stamp with the heart design on it in the upper right corner. Now it was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive it in about one week. I drove to the post office and put my letter in the outgoing mail slot. Shelly will be so surprised!

"The previous night and this morning before work I noticed I was missing a lot of necessary ingredients for my future meals . I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work . After I finished working I drove over to the store . It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot . Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . First , I picked up my deli . They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home .

Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . First , I picked up my deli . They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home .",What did they do when they had their groceries?,Packed them into their car and drove home

"My family and I decided that the evening was beautiful so we wanted to have a bonfire.  First, my husband went to our shed and gathered some dry wood.  I placed camp chairs around our fire pit.  Then my husband placed the dry wood in a pyramid shape inside the fire pit.  He then set some small kindling ablaze using a long lighter.  Once the kindling reached the dry wood, it set the wood on fire.  We then sat around the fire for some time, adding more logs as the previous ones burned out.  We cooked marshmallows on sticks over the open flames.  When the marshmallows were golden brown, we placed them between two graham crackers with chocolate pieces.  We ate our S'mores as we joked, laughed and told stories around our beautiful fire.  When we finished, I put away our camp chairs.  My husband made sure the fire was out by dousing it with some water and we went inside to bed.

"Last night after dinner, I had ""dishwasher duty."" That means that it was my turn to do the dishes and unload the dishwasher.

Inside there is a brown and jelly mixture that doesn't smell too good to me. Felix has already smelled it and he is purring at my leg.

"After an extremely hard week at work, I decided that I wanted to treat myself to something nice. For this something nice, I decided to go to a sauna.

"Last night, my friends and I wanted to make a bonfire. So, we made sure that we had some fire wood. We went to the back of her yard and gathered up some dry wood. My friend reminded us that the wood had to be dry, or else it would not burn very well. Next, we all helped out by placing the chunks of wood into the fire pit. Once we stacked the wood into the fire pit, my friend grabbed a lighter and lighter fluid. My friend poured some of the lighter fluid out onto the wood, and then used the lighter to light the wood.

Yesterday I made a flight reservation to fly from Boston to Chicago.  The first step in making a flight reservation is to determine which airline you would like to fly.  I picked American Airlines because I have most of my airline miles with them and I always like to earn more miles.  I accessed the American Airlines website and entered the desired dates of my flight.  The website then provided me a bunch of different flight options for both my departing and returning flights.  I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable and I selected them.  I was then directed to pay for my flight which I did via my American Airlines credit card.

"We spent a week getting our gear together for our big camping trip. After making sure everything was packed and the tent had no holes from the last trip, we put everything into the car and set out on our way. After a four hour drive we arrived at the campgrounds. We found our spot and unpacked the car. First up was pitching the tent, then we set about making a fire to cook dinner. It took awhile to collect all the wood we needed and get it roaring, but once we got the food on the fire we could finally relax. After soaking in nature and enjoying our campfire meal, night had fallen and it was time for bed. We curled up in our sleeping bags and told scary stories until we drifted off. The next morning we awoke early to stoke the fire and get breakfast started. A day of hiking and fishing went by far too fast and after another night under the stars we packed up our gear and headed home. Are they camping in a tent?","We spent a week getting our gear together for our big camping trip.

After making sure everything was packed and the tent had no holes from the last trip, we put everything into the car and set out on our way. After a four hour drive we arrived at the campgrounds. We found our spot and unpacked the car. First up was pitching the tent, then we set about making a fire to cook dinner. It took awhile to collect all the wood we needed and get it roaring, but once we got the food on the fire we could finally relax. After soaking in nature and enjoying our campfire meal, night had fallen and it was time for bed. We curled up in our sleeping bags and told scary stories until we drifted off. The next morning we awoke early to stoke the fire and get breakfast started.

"It was a very hot sunny Saturday morning and me and my family decide to go to the beach. Before going to the beach we had to pack the car. We packed some snacks. We packed a cooler with all our drinks and water. We put on our bathing suits and brought towels, beach chairs, a beach umbrella, beach toys, and a beach ball. Mom brought sun tan lotion to protect us from the sun. Once we got to the beach mom and dad setup all off the chairs, umbrella and towels. Mom laid down on a towel while dad went running to the ocean. We swam but not too far because the water was very deep. There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards. There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles. Dad helped us build our sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in it would fill in our pool. At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water. There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguard had to blow his whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach. I have heard that sometimes you can see shark in the ocean but lucky for us we did not see any sharks. Visiting the beach was very fun for the whole family as mom can relax and get a tan and dad could play and swim with us.

"Yesterday I hosted a barbecue for about twenty people. It was a really fun event and I enjoyed having my friends over to my beach house.  To prepare for the barbecue I went shopping at the grocery store for hamburgers, hotdogs, rolls, chips, salad and soda.  When I returned from the store I prepared the salads and laid all of the food out to be cooked on the grill.  As my friends began to arrive one of them volunteered to cook all of the food while the rest of us socialized and played volley ball.  As the food was prepared we all enjoyed eating a burger or hot dog and then we quickly returned to playing different lawn games such as croquet and horseshoes.

"I need to buy a new dress, so I am going to the shopping centre. There are many stores there, so I am likely to find a nice dress. It is for a celebration I will attend. I drive to the center. It is three miles away and traffic is good. When I arrive, I easily find a parking space near the entrance. I walk to the entrance. The shopping center is very large and modern looking.

"In the morning I felt hungry and decided to make myself some scrambled eggs for breakfast. I took out a carton of eggs from the refrigerator and placed it on the counter.

"Yesterday your father and I decided to go play a few rounds of tennis.  Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with two people, sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs.  There is a low net between both people playing the game.  We use tennis rackets and tennis balls to hit the ball back and forth to each other.  Sometimes one person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball so that person scores.  The person with the highest score without any fouls or out of bounds wins the set.  We played for a few hours before both of us became extremely tired, then we came home.

We wrote down the food and the amount that we would have to buy to make the recipes.  We circled all of the food on the list that we thought we might not need to buy.  We took the shopping list and also wrote down where in the store we would find the food.  We organized it from the fruit to the dairy in an organized order.  We put the shopping list on our fridge so that we wouldn't forget it the next day when we went to go buy the food. Were they outdoors when they made it?","After the week was over, my wife and I sat down to make a shopping list.  We thought about foods we wanted to eat that week.

"Sometimes for dinner I like to have fish instead of chicken or beef.  When I want to have fish for dinner I will go to my local fish market and pick out something I like.  Some times it might be salmon, sometimes tuna, or maybe a white fish like tilapia or flounder.  I will buy a pound of it, and the fish monger will wrap it in wax paper and put it in a bag for me.  Once I have it home, I check it, finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish.  I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, vinegar and olive oil.  I might put a few onions in with it.  I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad.  Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer.  While the fish bakes, I will make other side dishes.  When the timer rings I know its done and I carefully take it out with oven mitts.  It smells so good of garlic and its nice and cooked through.  While I set the table, I let it cool and after a few minutes I serve my self a piece and my salad and side dishes.

"It was afternoon and I was not sure what I was going to fix for dinner. I asked my little boy and he requested ham and cheese croissants.

"The other day, my friend wanted to go outside.  I suggested that we go and play tennis.  He said that he had some racquets that we could play with, so I told him to bring them.  I drove to the tennis court that was at the park and we got ready to play.  I brought some balls to hit and he gave me a racquet to play with.  We started on opposite sides of the court and practiced hitting the balls over the net.  We did a really good job and decided to start playing.  We kept score by whoever made two bounces on the opposite team's court.  I did really well and I won over 40 points.  That meant that I had one the game.

"I decided that for Mother's Day I wanted to make a camping trip, so I called the camping grounds to reserve a space. Once I confirmed that our space was reserved for our trip, I began to pack our belongings in art suitcases. I packed pillows, bed sheets, pillows, food, medicine, toiletries, shoes, and anything else that I felt we needed to have with us while we were away. Additionally, I ensure that we had bug  repellent spray, hats and jackets to protect ourselves while out in the wild. We also brought pots, pans, gallons of water, eating utensils and even an electric griddle so that we could cook and eat- even if we did not have a stove or oven.

We changed into our formal wedding wear once we arrived at the hotel where we would be staying for the evening.  We drove to the church and walked in.  The wedding was about to start so we quickly found some seats near other friends of ours.  An organ began to play, which let us know that the ceremony was starting.  Members of the wedding party arrived in a procession.  The bride was the last to arrive at the altar.  A minister performed the ceremony.  The bride and groom exchanged vows and also exchanged rings.  When the ceremony finished, the couple kissed, and everyone applauded.  Then the bride and groom and their bridesmaids and groomsmen marched back out of the church.  Afterwards, they took many pictures before the reception.

"It was a cool spring evening and we wanted to have a family get together on the beach around a bonfire. After getting permission from the city, we began to plan the night. First we went to a local man and bought all of the necessary bonfire wood, which is much bigger than the logs that would go into a fireplace. We went to the grocery store to pick up all of the necessary ingredients for a cookout next to the bonfire. We bought burgers, hot dogs, and buns for each. We made sure we had every vegetable available to go onto a burger including condiments and cheeses. We picked up several bags of chips and ingredients for s'mores. We arrived at the beach just before sunset and built the bonfire with the very long logs. Once we felt like they were all in place, we lit the fire and began to cook so everything would be ready for our guests once they arrived. Did they have fun?","It was a cool spring evening and we wanted to have a family get together on the beach around a bonfire. After getting permission from the city, we began to plan the night.

"We were excited about the awesome new mall and planned all week to visit it this past weekend! I called my sisters and friends and we all decided to meet in the front at noon on Saturday. There was plenty of parking and nice security cameras to keep us safe. We walked in the first large store and everyone decided to split up and meet at the food court two hours later. Alone, I looked at the ladies shoes. I bought a pair of dress up shoes and walked over to the nearby makeup. They were having a promotion so I bought my favorite kind to get a free bag and then checked out a new kind before I bought some and lipstick. Both were priced great. Next, I went to the housewares section and bought a coffee maker in black. Hand mixers were on sale across the isle so I bought one for the camp. The color I chose is red to match the blender. Next, I left the large store and went to nearby children's store to pick out toys for my kids. Four games and two balls looked great and exactly what they would like. Then I spotted some outdoor clothing and searched for something to give me to a little relief from daily laundry. After I went to a wonderful new ladies purse store and bought a new Gucci for the job interview ahead, I realized it was time to meet at the food court. Realizing it was all the way across the mall, I hurriedly walked that way and saw my friends and sisters standing in front waiting. We shared some strawberry ice cream and coffee before we walked back to our cars and said goodbye. As I drove home and thought about my purchases and good time with friends and family, I smiled. I live in a nice city. Were they shopping for themselves?","We were excited about the awesome new mall and planned all week to visit it this past weekend!

"Yesterday I woke up and decided to wear my favorite cardigan sweater to work.  After taking a shower and eaten breakfast I started getting dressed.  I put on a pair of jeans and then I reached for my favorite black cardigan.  As I began to button it up I realized that one of the buttons had fallen off.  Of course I did not want to wear any other sweater, just this one as it was my favorite.  I went to my spare room and dug my sewing kit out of the dresser.  I found a thread and button that would match and I quickly threaded a needle.  I began to methodically move the needle through the holes in the button to sew it back onto the sweater.  After a few minutes I cut the thread and secured the button to the sweater.  Finally I was able to put my sweater on and head off to work.

"My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married .

People on the flight were pretty happy to finally leave and a lot of people were having drinks . Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas .

I wanted to spruce up my house before my team members from work came over for a training. I had three paintings of plumeria flowers waiting to be hung on the wall. These paintings were very special to me. A friend gave them to me. They use to hang in her house that she recently sold. I was happy to receive them and hang them in my house. I first decided which wall would best display the pictures. I picked the wall in the dining room. I put the paintings on the floor at the base of the wall to see how I would space the paintings. I then asked my daughter to hold one painting up so I could measure the distance from the ceiling with a measuring tape. I measure the distance and marked the wall with a pencil. I hammered a nail on the mark and then hung my pictures. How long did it take to hang it?,I wanted to spruce up my house before my team members from work came over for a training.

"Today I went to the sauna and relaxed in the room for thirty minutes. I went with a friend and when we opened the door to the sauna, we realized that it was cold.

"We normally set a menu on Sunday for each day of the upcoming week to avoid chaos during dinner time. Before I leave for the day in the morning, I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal. At around five-thirty, I begin preparing the meal. One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and seasoned green beans. I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs, ketchup, and a bit of egg to bind it. I also lightly season it for flavor. I push it into the loaf pan, and put it in the oven to cook. I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans. I like to use fresh green beans. They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking them, but they taste so much fresher. I season them with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice. When the oven dings, dinner is ready for my family and I to enjoy.

"My hair is dirty and feels oily when I touch it today, so it is time to wash it. I like washing my hair in the shower because it is much easier than in a bath tub. I turn the shower on and make sure the water is nice and warm, but not too hot. I step in the shower and get my hair nice and wet. It is good to use shampoo and conditioner. First, I take some shampoo that I like and rub it onto my head. This cleans the part of the hair that is close to your head and also cleans the skin there that gets oily. After the shampoo is rubbed into my head, I let the water from the shower rinse out all the soap. Once the soap is out, I take some conditioner and rub it into the longer parts of my hair and the ends. This keeps it nice and soft and healthy. I let the conditioner sit in my hair for a while, and then rinse it all out in the warm water. I dry off, and feel better knowing that my hair is nice and clean again.

"This morning, like any other morning, I woke up still tired. Coffee is something I require daily to function. Up until last year, I used a regular coffee pot, and would brew about six cups, and drink most of it. Last year, for my birthday, I got a Keurig machine that brews individual cups. It has become a hobby of mine to collect different coffee and tea flavors, and try something new. Today, I felt like having one of my fancier kinds of coffee. This kind is a Gevalia mocha latte. It tastes like a hot chocolate and coffee blended together. I added some water to my Keurig machine, and within a minute it was ready to brew. I put the k-cup into the slot on the machine, and added the chocolate packet to an empty coffee mug. Today I used my favorite teal coffee cup with birds and flowers on it. The machine sputtered out a delicious cup of coffee, I stirred the chocolate powder into the coffee until it was blended.

"In my English class I was recently assigned to read the book brave new world .

Calling in ahead to make sure that they did indeed have the book that I wanted , I then headed in the direction of the library . When I arrive they had already had the book up front as I requested so that all I had to do was go pick it up . Or so I thought . In actuality I had to spend time getting a new library card . The librarian walked me through the process while also giving me a little background on the book I was about to read .

"For my anniversary with my husband, I decided to cook him a very fancy and nice breakfast. One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice. I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this! I went to my local farmer's market and got the biggest, juiciest oranges I could find. I got about ten oranges because I wasn't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband. I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink. It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use! I was excited to try it. I sliced all of my oranges in half and plugged the juicer in. I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice. To my luck, I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later. I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice, and he said that the juice was his favorite part!

I got about ten oranges because I wasn't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband. I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink. It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use! I was excited to try it. I sliced all of my oranges in half and plugged the juicer in. I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice.

"I went for a driving lesson when I was sixteen years old. In my town, the driving lesson had to be 3 separate days of driving for two hours at a time. My driver was very cool and relaxed. Driving for the first time is a very nervous experience so it was good to have such a laid back guy as my instructor. It helped to put all of the worries to rest. I was very nervous at first. But we started driving around town and I got more used to it. In the instructor's car, they have pedals on their side of the car as well. So that is a comfort knowing that they can take control of the car if anything goes wrong. That really helped to make me worry a lot less.

"It was a Monday evening in a warm July heat wave. My wife and I had just completed a particularly tasty meal that I had prepared for the both of us. We were both very full and sat in momentary silence as we pondered the situation in front of us. We knew we had to clean the table off, but neither of us were particularly excited about the task at hand. At last, we came to a conclusion. I would clear the plates, silverware, napkins and drink glasses from the table and put them in the dishwasher.

After the plates, silverware, napkins and glasses were clear, she sprayed the wood cleaner across the surface of the table.

"When I was a boy scout, we went fishing to a lake.  When we were on the lake (it was frozen), we decided to fish for some fish.  We drilled a hole into the lake and caught a lot.  We wanted to cook them, so we cleaned them out of all the nasty stuff in their body and started a fire.  When the fire was getting calmed down, the hot coals started to steam.  When it started steaming, we got the fish out and put it on a cast iron pan.  We put the pan on the middle of the fire with the lid on it and we waited while the fish cooked.  It smelled really good to us, especially with how hungry that we were.  After it started to smell almost burned, we took the pan off of the fire with hot gloves and ate the fish inside when cooled.

While casually browsing through my friends pictures online I discovered a new revelation . They are called Lush bath bombs and the are colorful scented fizz balls . I quickly ordered a few online from their website and when they came I was overcome with excitement . I brought a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one . I put the Hello Kitty tub stopper in my bath tub and ran my bathwater until the tub was halfway full . Then I dropped the bath bomb in the water and was anointed by the wonderful smell of lavender . The water in the tub fizzled with pretty blue glitter . I got in an soaked for more than an hour and got out feeling like a million bucks . I seemed to be a thousand times cleaner than I was before I got it . I even smelled great the whole entire day .

"I am so excited to learn how to drive today with Scott. We are in a large vacant parking lot and no one else is around so it will be perfectly safe for us, the car and anyone else. As we both get in the car, we put on our seatbelts. Check. Now he instructs me to put the key in the ignition and give it a gentle turn forward toward the front of the car. I hear the engine crank and can feel it hum. He tells me to grab the crankshaft and put it into the ""D"" position. I feel the car surge forward and immediately hit the brake pedal on the left and car stops. He tells me it's fine and to give it a little gas. The car begins to move forward as travel in a straight line. The more gas I give it from the pedal on the right, the faster we go!

Who is the coach of the lesson?","I am so excited to learn how to drive today with Scott. We are in a large vacant parking lot and no one else is around so it will be perfectly safe for us, the car and anyone else. As we both get in the car, we put on our seatbelts. Check. Now he instructs me to put the key in the ignition and give it a gentle turn forward toward the front of the car. I hear the engine crank and can feel it hum. He tells me to grab the crankshaft and put it into the ""D"" position. I feel the car surge forward and immediately hit the brake pedal on the left and car stops.

I love shopping online. Last weekend I wanted to order some vitamins. I looked on two web sites to find exactly the kind of vitamins I wanted. And I also looked at prices. I even tried to find some near me so that they would be shipped to me quick. The quickest way to get them and not have to pay too much money would cause them to get to me in four days. So I decided to order and wait. On Monday morning there was a package by my front door. I opened it. It was the vitamins. It took less than 24 hours for them to get to me. I was happy the vitamins were here. I tried to figure out how they go to me so quick. Then I figured out that they came from an Amazon facility near me. I might order from Amazon again since they got here quick. What website did they shop on?,I love shopping online. Last weekend I wanted to order some vitamins.

"Last night I decided to make Mexican Bean Salad for dinner. This is a really nice, light, and flavorful dish to eat during the summer. I looked up the recipe and took out a notepad and a pen so I could make a list of all of the ingredients I needed to get at the grocery store on my way home from work. Some of the ingredients I already had - like olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and cumin. However, I needed many of the other necessary ingredients in order to make the recipe. On my shopping list, I wrote that I needed one can of black beans, one can of kidney beans, one can of cannellini beans, a bag of frozen corn, one red onion, one green bell pepper, one red bell pepper, and one bunch of cilantro. I put the shopping list in my purse so I could reference it later at the store and make sure I buy everything that I need for dinner.

"This morning when I woke up, I noticed something was strange about my alarm clock.  Instead of being loud, like normal, it was fairly faint, and changing volume on it's own.

"I was invited for a party, and I had a very nice dress that I decided to wear. But when I saw, it has one button missing. So I had to fix it. That button had 4 holes, so I wanted to fix in such a way that it looks good. So I had to choose exact matching color with my dress. The button was golden. I started to sew it on back side so , the knot will not show up. Then I poke my needle in one of the hole and stretched my thread all the way, then I inserted the needle in to the opposite side of hole. When it went down, I pulled it all the way, and then, got it out from the hole as which was empty so far, and then from above again I will repeat the same thing and insert the thread opposite to that hole. I will continue doing that till I feel like it is strong then I will make knot and fix it firmly with button. my job was done.

I started to sew it on back side so , the knot will not show up. Then I poke my needle in one of the hole and stretched my thread all the way, then I inserted the needle in to the opposite side of hole. When it went down, I pulled it all the way, and then, got it out from the hole as which was empty so far, and then from above again I will repeat the same thing and insert the thread opposite to that hole. I will continue doing that till I feel like it is strong then I will make knot and fix it firmly with button. my job was done.",Were they experienced in sewing?,"Yes, they were able to reattach the button with no help."

"Baking a Birthday Cake For an Awesome Nephew It was the day before my nephew 's third birthday . I wanted to bake him a very special birthday cake . He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . I poured yellow cake batter in the medium-sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' I topped off the cake with a number 3 candle .

"2 summers ago, my brother and went on a trip to stay with our aunt and her family for a whole week. We spent the entire week before we left preparing for this trip. The main thing that we needed to worry about was having clothes for the week. Knowing this, we got our suitcases, and made sure to set aside different clothes, including underwear, for just about each day of the next week. Then, we took some extra clothes for swimming just in case we would be doing this while we were over there. After the clothes, we made sure to pack our toiletries, like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, and so on. We packed these in a small bag the day before we left.

"I had been putting of visiting a doctor because my regular primary care provider was nearly a mile away, and I owed the money that I simply did not have. I decide to visit an office that was much closer.

I filled out all the necessary paperwork and had a visit scheduled. The date came and I went to see my new primary care provider. I had anxiety as I always do when seeing a medical professional.

"After a day of washing and drying clothes, I gathered aside the items of clothing to be hung up in a separate basket. I wanted to make sure to get rid of any wrinkles in them before hanging them up. I then brought the laundry basket upstairs and brought the ironing board out of the closet. I unfolded the ironing board and got out the iron from the closet as well. I brought the iron to the sink so I could fill it in order to use the steam function. I then brought the iron to set it upon the ironing board. I plugged the iron's cord into the socket. As I heard the iron start to heat up, I set the first item to be ironed on the board. I flattened the pants on the board so the creases would be right at the seams.

I gave him the choice of toppings and he just wanted pepperoni and cheese. I got his half with pepperoni and my half with vegetables. We put in our order and added some chicken bites, for some extra protein. We built our fort while we waited for the pizza to arrive. The pizza came and we had a pizza fort party by lantern light. I was an amazing memory from a situation that was less than positive.",Why did they choose to order take out and not go out?,they wanted to have a fort party

"Yes going on a train , this is was our ideal weekend activity not too long ago . We purchased tickets to travel from Boston to New York City . As we entered the platform of the train is was pure steel and looked so solidly strong . We walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there . Shortly the train horn blasted making me jump of my seat lol . Anyway we soon started moving and our train ride was underway . The conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets . love scenery so I had the window seat watching everything along the way . First I saw large suburban areas but as we got into Connecticut many farms were being spotted . It was n't very hilly but sure was a country atmosphere . Soon we approached NYC and the train came to slow stop , we had arrived at our destination . The ride overall was rather smooth and it did n't seem to take all that long .

"I saw from my alarm clock that it was time to feed my fish. I tend to feed them every day at 5:00 pm. I walked over to the tank to see how they were doing. They were swimming around and ready to be fed. I grabbed my jar of fish food and screwed the cap. Then I scooped out just enough food to feed them for one day. The scooped food went right into the water. My fish were in a slight frenzy to get fed. They swam all at once to the surface to eat up the food that I had given them.

"Terri likes to vacuum the carpet, it is one of her chores she does every other day.  After school, she has a small list of little chores to do around the house.

"Last night I decided I was going to go dancing. My husband, daughter, sisters and their husbands and nieces went out to a nice place where a lot of people go. We got to the place we were going dancing. There was a guy at the door checking ID's to make sure there wasn't anyone under the age of 21 going in. Of course we were all over 21 so there weren't any issues. We all went in and found us a table. We then decided to order some drinks and about that time a waitress came over and asked us what we would like to have. We all gave her our order and she went to get the drinks. While she was away a good song started playing and we all decided to dance. We all went out on the dance floor and danced until the end of the song.

"When I cooked pasta last, I had a great experience. I was with my girlfriend and we were in the mood for pasta and meat sauce. In order to do this, we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box. We then boiled the water, before putting the pasta in. As we put the pasta in, we stirred it and watched the water boil. After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes, we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat. Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste, we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let it get hot. Upon both the pasta and the sauce getting hot, we put it all on bowls and ate the pasta.

I had a pile of clothes that needed to be washed. First I separated the white clothes from the colored clothes. I washed the white clothes first. I put the clothes into the washing machine.

Yesterday my wife and I wanted to watch a new movie that had just hit the video stands.  I went to the local store which had a Red Box video vending machine outside of it.  I looked over the selections it had till I found the one I wanted.  I put my credit card into the slot for paying and purchased a copy of the movie to watch.  I took the copy from the machine and headed home after stopping at the store to buy some popcorn for the movie.  I placed it into the DVD and watched the movie while enjoying the popcorn.

"I sometimes put a gift in a box, if it doesn't already have one, to make it easier to wrap. It's nice to put tissue paper inside the box, too. That makes opening the gift more interesting. After I have the gift boxed, I assemble my wrapping supplies. I use rolled wrapping paper, clear tape, scissors, and ribbon. Next, I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper. I  study it, trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll. I don't want to waste paper, but I also want to neatly cover the gift. Once I decide how much paper to cut off, I mark the place with pencil, then fold there, and cut the paper along the fold line. Now I turn the gift upside down, and position it in the center of my paper. I pull up one end of the paper, and tape it to the center bottom of the box. I pull the other end of the paper smooth, pull it around  the box and tape it in place too. Then I do the ends of the package, folding the paper down, cutting it shorter if I must, and smoothing it neatly around the gift box. I tape it in place, and decorate the box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made. did they put a bow on their gift?","I sometimes put a gift in a box, if it doesn't already have one, to make it easier to wrap.

Now I turn the gift upside down, and position it in the center of my paper. I pull up one end of the paper, and tape it to the center bottom of the box. I pull the other end of the paper smooth, pull it around  the box and tape it in place too. Then I do the ends of the package, folding the paper down, cutting it shorter if I must, and smoothing it neatly around the gift box. I tape it in place, and decorate the box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made.",Who offered to help them?,Nobody
"Today, I had to pack a suitcase. I put all of my favorite things into it, as I was going to be gone for a very, very long time.

"Yesterday afternoon, my sister and I went to the outdoor neighborhood swimming pool. The pool requires that visitors either live in the neighborhood or be guests of a neighborhood resident in order to enter, and because we met those criteria, we had no problems getting in. The day was sunny and above eighty degrees. I wore my teal one-piece swimsuit and my sister wore her pink bikini. After we had walked to the pool from our house, we both lathered up with sunscreen and laid our towels and pool bags on vacant lounge chairs. There were only a dozen people at the pool. One of them was my sister's friend, so she left immediately to go splash around with her and hang out on a raft. I ordered a raspberry smoothie and laid out with my copy of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" while the sun heated my skin. When I started to sweat, I rinsed off in the provided shower and then put on my goggles and got into the pool to swim laps. Thankfully, the lap swim lane was clear, and I got a good work-out in. The day started to cloud over, and my sister's friend left, so after that the two of us sat in the shallow end of the pool with the warm water rising to our shoulders and chatted until we had both had our fill of pool time.

"Now we stood here in the line in front of the large glass window with people inside. Once our turn came up, we bought tickets to the movie we wanted to watch. The showtime wasn't for another 30 minutes. So we decided to go the arcade next door and play some games. They have real old classic arcade games there.  Remember Galaga? Donkey Kong? Even the old Star Wars simulator. That was my favorite game when I was a kid...  Once we're inside the theater, we bought some candies, popcorn, and some drinks. With our hands full with goodies, we headed into viewing room. It was already packed with people. We find a pair of good seats towards the back. There are nice old couple seated towards the aisle.

"To remove and replace a garbage bag, first lift the full garbage bag from the garbage can. Some garbage bags have ties or strings that are attached to them and can be used to close the top of the garbage bag by pulling on the strings until the opening completely closes. Then the ends of the strings can be tied in a knot so the bag will not open. If the bag does not have strings attached, use a twist tie to close the opening by gathering the top of the bag together and wrapping the twist tie around the end of the bag and twisting the ends of the twist tie together. Take the full, closed garbage bag outside so the garbage man can pick it up. Then, take a new garbage bag out of the box and unfold it before putting it in the garbage can. You can fold the top edge of the garbage bag over the rim of the can so that garbage does not get between the can and the bag.

She was so excited to be there she had not gone to this particular shopping centre before. Sally's first thought was to go to the book store and see what kind of new hits that she wanted to read. She made it to the book section and picked out a book that was titled: the magical uses and wonders of Flippity Floppity Bibbity Boppity Boo. and she thought it was wonderful so she brought it up to the counter and paid for the book. Sally was getting tired after all that shopping so she got back in her car and went home. she had to stop at the gas station to fuel up her car and then when she was done, she got back in the car and drove home. she was very tired so she went to sleep. Goodnight Sally. What did they do after finding what they wanted?","Sally just got her pay check in the mail and she felt like she deserved to go shopping and treat herself to something nice.

"Today was the start of Spring, so I decided it was time to get some cleaning done. The first and largest thing to deal with was my apartment flat. I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place. I put as many items into drawers and closets as possible to reduce clutter. I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where the furniture is normally sitting. I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun. Then I swept the rest of the floor after dusting any surfaces that needed it. Afterwards, I cleaned all the windows, inside and out, and moved to the bathroom. After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner, I took a look around my flat to assess my work. My apartment was now clean and it felt great! When did they change what area they were cleaning?","Today was the start of Spring, so I decided it was time to get some cleaning done. The first and largest thing to deal with was my apartment flat.

"Cleaning the table is done after every meal. Sometimes people make a big mess when they eat and sometimes not. It sometimes depends on what we eat. Usually I like to get the plates off the table first. If there is not much food left on the plates then I will stack them on top of each other with the dirtiest plate on top. And I take the dishes to the sink. Next I get the silverware and take them to the sink. If there is food left I remove the food from the table and put the food into bowls to be saved in the refrigerator as left overs. Glasses, coffee cups and dessert plates will be removed from table.

"I had been wanting to get my tattoo fixed for 5 years now and I just couldn't seem to save up the several hundred dollars it would cost to get it fixed.

"This morning I woke up and all the covers were off my bed. Even though I don't normally make up my bed, this morning it was necessary. I decided to change my sheets, since they were off anyway.

I plugged  it in the it in the power outlet.  I turned on the vacuum. I cleaned in rows, so I do not skip any area. Then, I attached flat vacuum to clean the sides of walls and the area under the furniture. the sound was very loud  I placed  the bottom of the vacuum on the carpet . I vacuumed all of the carpet and it was finally all clean . I called my family to all look at it. It was good and I was finally done with it.",Where does the dirt go?,in a bag
"This weekend , I decided I wanted to try baking my first cake . I found a recipe online for an easy to make cake , printed out a list of the ingredients , and went to the grocery store to get them . I knew about some of the common things , like eggs , flour , and sugar , but the list helped me get a lot of things I did n't own and would n't know to get . When I got home , I followed the recipe as closely as I could , adding each of the ingredients at the exact amount of the recipe asked for . I mixed them all up as described , and put them into a pan that I had borrowed from my mother . I put the pan in the oven and let the cake cook . I checked on it occasionally to see if it was looking OK , and because I was really excited to see how it was turning out . When it was done in the oven I removed it , and applied an extra thick coat of frosting . I was supposed to wait for the cake to cook , but I was too excited to try it out and ate it much sooner than recommended . It was delicious !

"One day our family decided to go on a one-day outing.  We got into the car and buckled our seat belts.  Dad put his car key into the ignition slot on the side of the steering wheel and started the car.  He carefully backed out of the driveway, using the side rear view mirror to watch for oncoming traffic.  He put the car into the D slot to move forward and we were off on our trip.  Dad drove in the right lane on the freeway most of the way.  When he wanted to pass another car, he used his turn signal to signal that he was going to change lanes and pass.  After passing the other car, he would use his turning signal to signal that he was getting back into the right lane.  It started to rain and he used his windshield wipers to clear the window.

"Mary makes her bed up every weekend with new sheets from her mother's sheet closet.

"The grass on our front lawn was beginning to get tall and thick, so before it grew any higher, I thought it would be a good idea to cut it.  I decided to pull out our lawnmower from the shed in our backyard.  There are several kinds of lawnmowers, but the kind of lawnmower we own in gas-powered.  Because our lawnmower had no gas in it, I pulled a gas storage container off of a high shelf in our backyard shed and filled the gas tank.  To start the lawnmower, I pulled the starting cable vigorously a few times.

"Keeping a clean bathroom to me is an important part of good hygiene. This is something that I had to do just recently. I noticed that the toilet and counters were stained, and that the mirrors were filthy. I then set aside all of the necessary cleaners to use in the bathroom, and got to work. I first worked on the counter tops. I used a special marble cleaner to clean them, and it really made them shine. After the counters, I did the mirrors. I used a very strong glass cleaner to get the job done, and by the time I finished, the mirrors were spotless. Lastly, I took care of the toilet. I cleaned the outside of it with the same marble cleaner I used on the counters, and used a special toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of the bowl. Just for good measure, I mopped the floor of the bathroom, washed out the bathtub with shower cleaner, and sprayed the room with air freshener to make it smell nice.

"Yesterday evening, my friend Jasmine called me on my cell phone. We talked about so many things and we were on the phone for about 2 hours. She asked me how life was ever since I moved from Denver to Atlanta. I told her that life had been amazing and the only thing that sucks, is the horrible traffic. Jasmine also mentioned that she will be visiting me next month for a week long vacation. I was so excited to hear that I will have a visitor because sometimes it can get lonely not having family in the same city as you. I told Jasmine that I will plan to take her to some of the best restaurants in town and plan a big shopping trip. During our phone call, we also talked about the days when we were in college together. After a while of talking, we decided that it was time to get off the phone and take care of some things at home.

"It was time for my cat to eat her dinner. Her name is Gracie. When it's time for her to eat, she will meow constantly and paw at her food bowl. She also will follow you sometimes. When I noticed her doing this, I walked to the kitchen cabinet where her food is kept and pulled out one small can of tuna and chicken flavored wet cat food, which is her favorite. She saw that I did this and affectionately brushed up against my legs. I opened the can using the pull tab on top of the lid, and used a spoon to scrape all of the food out of the can and into her food dish.

"My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish. Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market.  When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up.  When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones. Some of the fish he buys still has the head, fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too. The head of the fish is really good to make fish soup. I like it better when he leaves the scales (skin) of the fish as it tastes really good. There are many different ways that he cooks the fish. Sometimes he will  fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it.  He also bakes the fish in the oven which makes it soft and tender. My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi.  In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it.  My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain.

"We had just come home from the beach one Saturday afternoon . We had a great time , but were very sweaty , sandy and sticky with old sunscreen , sweat and salt from the ocean . After unpacking the car , I had to take a bath . I love our deep soaking tub . I put in the drain plug and started running the water , making sure the temperature of the water was just right , and put in my favorite bath scents and soap . When the tub was full , I immersed myself deep into the tub and just let my body soak for a while . It was good to sit in the nice , warm water and let everything just relax and melt away from me . I washed my hair with my favorite shampoo , as I had a lot of sand in it from playing at the beach that day . I scrubbed my body well with a washcloth , to get off all the sand and ocean salt that had dried on my skin , along with the sunscreen that I had been using . It was very relaxing and I felt really good . I then pulled the drain on the tub and let all the dirty water go down . I had a big , fluffy bath towel that I dried off in , and I put on clean clothes . I was ready to finish up our fun day with some dinner and good times with my family .

I put in the drain plug and started running the water , making sure the temperature of the water was just right , and put in my favorite bath scents and soap . When the tub was full , I immersed myself deep into the tub and just let my body soak for a while . It was good to sit in the nice , warm water and let everything just relax and melt away from me . I washed my hair with my favorite shampoo , as I had a lot of sand in it from playing at the beach that day . I scrubbed my body well with a washcloth , to get off all the sand and ocean salt that had dried on my skin , along with the sunscreen that I had been using . It was very relaxing and I felt really good . I then pulled the drain on the tub and let all the dirty water go down . I had a big , fluffy bath towel that I dried off in , and I put on clean clothes . I was ready to finish up our fun day with some dinner and good times with my family . Why did they stay in for a long as they did?","We had just come home from the beach one Saturday afternoon .

"I own a giant, diesel, 4 door truck that is red in color and mean in appearance. I work construction for my job so I need to have something that is able to tow and haul a lot of weight. One of the unfortunate side effects of owning such a large, mean truck, however, is the need to constantly put fuel in it! I usually go to the gas station twice a week to fill up my tank and empty my wallet. I pick a pump at my favorite gas station that is easy to drive into so I don't risk hitting other vehicles. I hop out and insert my credit card into the pump machine. After my card is read, I pull the gas nozzle off of the machine and insert it into my truck. I wait for what seems like forever as the pump fills my tank and the dollar amount endlessly increases.

"When I was at camp last summer, I wasn't allowed to use email, so I had to write a letter to my parents to tell them that I wanted to come home. I sat on my bunk with my notebook propped against my knees and thought about what I wanted to say. After a few minutes, I decided I knew what I wanted to say, so I picked up my pen and started moving it across the paper. First I put the date in the upper right hand corner. Then I wrote ""Dear Mom and Dad"" on the first line. I kept writing all the words I needed to use in order to convince my parents to let me come home. Then I signed the letter with my name. I folded the letter in half and then folded it in half again so that it would fit in an envelope. Then I put the letter in an envelope. I taped the envelope shut. Then I stuck a stamp on the upper right corner of the envelope. I wrote my parent's address on the middle of the envelope and then I walked to the camp office and gave my letter to the secretary so she could mail it for me.

"I decided to make a split pea soup for dinner, so I cleaned off a cutting board, wiped down the table, and got all of my needed ingredients ready.

Following this, I washed off the several stalks of celery I picked out, and chopped off the ends, throwing them away.

"This past month, I was very busy with planning a party for my younger brother. I had to find out a number of things, but the most important one was figuring out who I could invite to the party. After I had a good enough idea, I went to the store and bought several themed party invitations. After buying the invitations, I spent a long time writing names and addresses for people that I wanted to invite to the party. After finishing the writing and putting all of the invitations in envelopes, I put stamps on them so they could all be mailed out as soon as possible. I made sure that all of the invitations had stamps and the correct addresses of the people who would be getting them, and put them in my mailbox for the postman to take them to the post office to be sent off. On the day of the party, almost everyone I sent an invitation to came to the party, and that made my brother very happy.

"I always wash the dishes for my family, I think it a fairly fun chore, and I like it much better than other chores. One night, after a large family dinner, we had a lot of dishes to do.

Well, I stacked them so high that they kept falling over. Thankfully, none of them were made of glass.

"Last night, my pants ripped and I felt the need to sew them. The seam was ripped and the button fell of and I couldn't find it.

I turned this machine on attached it to the pants and began to sew. I noticed that the pants slowly begun to get fixed. Upon finishing, I turned off the machine and checked to make sure that my pants were completely fixed. I noticed that they were and tried them on.

"One of my lights in my lamp went out yesterday so I investigated to see what was the matter.  I checked and the lamp was plugged and circuit breaker not tripped so I checked the bulb in the lamp.  Further inspection revealed the bulb was brown so I knew it had burned out and needed replacement.  Not having any extra in the house, I decided to go to the local Home Depot to buy the bulb I need.  I checked the store and looked at the wide variety of available bulbs to purchase.  I finally settled on a 75 Watt equal LED bulb and went to the counter to make my purchase.  The clerk was friendly on check out and I got the five dollars from my wallet to buy the home.  I then drove home and returned to my house.

After taking a two week trip to Europe I arrived home with lots of laundry.  I decided that I should start washing my clothes the night I arrived home.  I did three loads of laundry but I was so tired that I tossed all of the clothes onto the couch without folding them.  I woke the next morning feeling a bit refreshed and decided that is was time to tackle the pile of clothing on the couch.  First I separated the clothes into heaps based on clothing type and then I began folding all of the items.  I used to work in a clothing store so I began folding my clothes very precisely.  I folded everything neatly and made piles based on how the clothes would be stores in my closet.

"Yesterday I decided to boil some milk so I could make cottage cheese. The first thing I did was select a pan to boil the milk. I decided to choose the widest pan I had, because the wider pan would let me boil the milk more quickly.

I crack my eggs into a bowl and whisk it up to make some scrambled eggs. But I need to cook the bacon first. I cook the bacon in butter until golden brown and crispy. My pan is full of oil and butter. I am going to scramble my eggs in that. It will be deliciously decadent. I scramble my eggs in rendered fat and butter mix until they're almost done. Then I put the eggs and the bacon on the plate. along with the bagel with cream cheese slathered all over it. It's time to eat. I need a dollop of pico de gallo for my eggs. Perfect.",How does the breakfast taste?,delicious!

"My friends and I love to go to the movie theater.  Every Tuesday, the movie theaters have cheap days, where you can go see a movie for $5, and then buy a drink and small snack for $5 too. So, we check online to see when the movies are playing, and we decide what we will see.  Then, once we do that, we all go in the car and drive to the theater right before the movie begins.  We park, and get out and stand in line for the tickets.  We usually all buy our own tickets, and then go in and order a drink and snack.  After that, we all go into the theater, and take our seats.

I needed to put wall paper on the walls of my room. The room was in dire need of new wall paper. The old wall paper was looking bad. I asked my friend Ryan to help me put new wall paper up. He was a painter and regularly did this kind of work. I first removed the old wall paper from the walls with Ryan. We then got the new wall paper and applied it to the walls. It required us to brush down the paper so it would stick. We checked to make sure everything was even. I did not want uneven wall paper. After we applied the first sheet we started applying the other ones. We checked to make sure the sheets were even as we went. Finally after applying the new sheets we cut the excess paper away. I wanted my room to look tidy and fresh. Overall it was fun putting up new wall paper with my friend. Why did they paper the room?,I needed to put wall paper on the walls of my room.

"It was a sad day.  June's great Aunt Martha had died a few days ago, and today was the day they would have her funeral.  Everyone in her family was dressed nicely, and made there way across town to the funeral home where the service would be held.  As the entered the room, there was a strong smell of flowers that made June's nose ache a little.  Her mom signed a book with her and her brothers names, and they made there way into a parlor where other people had gathered.  At the front of the room was a casket that was half way opened with Aunt Martha's body lying in it. The family made there way up to the front of the room to look at Aunt Martha. She looked as if she was taking a nap in her finest clothes.  Her make up and hair didn't really look like she used to wear them, but she didn't look scary like June had imagined.  They met some family members that were sad and crying, but others were laughing and remembering funny stories about Aunt Martha.  They made there way to a seat at the back of the parlor and a few songs were played while the curtains were drawn in the front  of the room.  When the curtains opened back up, the casket was closed with a large spray of flowers on top.  A pastor stood up and said some really nice things about Aunt Martha, and prayed.  The curtains closed again and the pastor told the crowd that the funeral would resume at Shady Oak Cemetery.  Afterwards, the group of people that had gathered made there ways to their car for the funeral procession to the cemetery.  June's family followed a long line of cars following a hearse with Aunt Martha's casket in the back.  A police man escorted the group of cars, and stopped traffic so the funeral procession didn't have to stop at red lights on the way to the cemetery.  As they pulled up to the gravesite, June saw a green tent with lots of folding chairs underneath, and a metal frame around a hole in the ground.

"I'm hungry and I think I want some scrambled eggs. I need to get my ingredients first. I open the refrigerator and grab two eggs, butter, and the milk.

They then asked me if I would like delivery or pick up. I wanted to spend the evening relaxing after a long day and just watch movies with my pizza, so I opted for delivery. Twenty minutes later the delivery man arrived at my door with my pizza. I pull out my debit card and swiped it, because that was my preferred method of payment. I then had to sign for using my debt card, and also made sure I filled in the empty line that said tip bedside it. I made sure to leave the delivery man a generous one since he was here in a timely manner and was quite polite in dealing with me. After he proceeded back to his car,  I sat down on the couch and ate my pizza while watching one of my favorite movies. It was a successful evening and the pizza was scrumptious!

"Last night I invited some friends over for dinner. I decided to set the dining room table for dinner, rather than have us all eat around the coffee table in the living room like my partner and I usually do. First, I chose the tablecloth. We have a purple tablecloth, a light blue snowflake patterned tablecloth, and a bright colored floral tablecloth. I chose the floral one because I felt it was most appropriate for summertime. Next, I put a cloth napkin at each place and set utensils on top of the napkin - a knife, fork, and spoon. Then I placed a plate at each setting, four in total. I added a water glass at each setting as well. Then I put out the salt and pepper in the middle of the table so it was accessible to everyone. Lastly, I lit two candles and placed them in the center of the table as well. The dining room table looked great and ready for a dinner party.

"It was a long day at work and I decided to stop at the gym before going home.  I ran on the treadmill and lifted some weights. I decided I would also swim a few laps in the pool.

"Today was a really hot day. It was 95 degrees. I decided to go to the swimming pool in my neighborhood and cool off. I put on my bathing suit, a cover up dress, a hat with a large brim, sunglasses, and flip flops. I packed a bag with sunscreen, a towel, and a cold bottle of water. Then I walked three blocks to the swimming pool. It was crowded, but I was able to find an available lounge chair on the side of the pool. I put my things down and took the sunscreen out of the bag. I prayed the sunscreen all over my body. Then I laid down on the chair to relax. After about twenty minutes, I was ready to go in the water and go swimming.

"Last weekend, my friend and I decided it would be a good time to paper our living room. The previous residents of the house we live in had used wallpaper on the living room walls that was a very odd shade of red, which we thought looked strange. We wanted the living room to get a new color of wallpaper, and we wanted to choose a color that would match our personality. We first went to Sherwin-Williams, which is a paint and wallpaper store. We looked at the wallpaper color samples and picked up a few brochures with examples of how the samples would look on our walls. We decided that a cheery yellow color would look best on our walls, and selected that color. We then returned to Sherwin-Williams and purchased the yellow wallpaper. We then applied the wallpaper to our walls and stood back to admire our work. Who did the work?","Last weekend, my friend and I decided it would be a good time to paper our living room.

I will also pack some pre-made sangria and lemon water in spill-proof bottles. I think chocolate chip cookies are great picnics too. They can go in a container so they don't get crushed.

"When you work in a restaurant, after the customers have paid the bill and left, you have to clean up the table and prepare it for the next customer.  Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person, but if it was a large family it could be very messy.  All the left over plates, cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed.  The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills, so it is fresh and clean for the next diners.   And if there are placemats they too will need replacing.  My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in, especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use.  Once the new place mats are down, a whole new table setting can be done.  Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table.  It may involve fancy folded napkins, or how the glasses or utensils get lined up. Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates, utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers.

"My name is Katie and I am a professional photographer.  My seven year old daughter Penny also takes pictures with her camera. When Penny was five she asked me to show her how to take photos.

"It has been raining a lot and the lawn has been growing. So I mowed the lawn this morning. I had to go to the gas station to get some more gas to put into the lawn mower.

I think it needed some more oil. I but a bit of oil in and it started right up. I mowed in rows as I usually do. There were several sticks on the ground I had to pick up.

"It is an exciting time when going to the movie theater. My mom takes me and my siblings every summer. The theater is about 30 minutes away from our house. My mom always buys tickets ahead of time to make sure we have tickets since the theater is a little distance away. Once we are at the theater we pick up our pre ordered tickets. We then head to the snack line. While waiting in the line we all decide what snacks we want. I love to get popcorn with lots of butter, a pickle and a large Dr. Pepper. After we get our snacks we head to the theater to watch the movie. Once inside, we pick out what seats we would like. We don't want to be too close or too far, the middle is the perfect spot.

My mom always buys tickets ahead of time to make sure we have tickets since the theater is a little distance away. Once we are at the theater we pick up our pre ordered tickets. We then head to the snack line. While waiting in the line we all decide what snacks we want. I love to get popcorn with lots of butter, a pickle and a large Dr. Pepper.

"I enjoy drinking tea.  I made tea just this morning as a pleasant start to my day.  I filled my kettle up with water and put it on the stove.  I turned the heat all the way up so that the water would get hot quickly.  When the kettle started to whistle, that let me know the water was hot.  I poured the water into a mug, being very careful not to burn myself.  I scooped out some tea leaves into a little tea infuser, which I put in my mug.  After several minutes, I felt like the tea was probably strong enough to start drinking.  I like to add a little honey to my tea to make it sweet.  After I finished my cup of tea, there was enough hot water to make more! I poured water into a thermos, added more tea to the tea infuser, and sealed it up tight so that I'd have some nice strong tea ready to drink when I got to work.

"Last night my air conditioner stopped working. It was so hot and sweaty while I was sleeping. It was clear when I woke up that I was going to have to change my sheets!

"I always wash my hair at the beginning of my shower. I make the water hot and stand under the hot water to make my hair wet. I switch between different shampoo and conditioner brands so grab whichever scent I want to smell that day. I squeeze a big glob of shampoo in my hand and rub my hands together then lather it into my hair, I rinse the shampoo out. I squeeze the matching conditioner into my hand and start at my roots rubbing it up to my scalp.

I liked the big entrance with all types of art all around. First we went to the painting area. There were many paintings. We could have spent the whole day looking at all the paintings and talking about them. One painting had a lady in front of a house. It looked simple, but my friend Becky explained the painting to me. The painting had meanings or symbolism in it. She said it was like a story looking at the lady's facial expression and how her house looked. Next we went to look at the sculptures. There were very old ones and some modern ones as well. I think I liked the paintings better. I liked the colors of the painting. Did they have dinosaurs at the museum ?","I went to the Dallas Museum of Art yesterday. It was so much fun. I took my friend Becky. She loves art. When we got there we bought our tickets.

"Our poor Baby saw the Doctor and she had a ear infection. The Doctor gave her some medicine to take for 10 days, to make her feel better. She likes bubblegum flavored so we had it made to taste just like bubblegum. We loaded her medicine dropper to the amount she needed. When she saw me with the dropper she curled her lips and started crying. I showed her I liked the medicine and that it was tasted really yummy. Then I pretended it was a truck and it drove right into her mouth. She looked puzzled at first then she smiled and reached for more. I laughed at her and said no you will need to wait until it is time for you to take it again. Now when she sees the dropped with her medicine she smiles at me and claps.

"When my girlfriend and I decided to take a vacation to Florida and we knew we needed to make flight reservations.  We went online and looked at our favorite airline to see what flights they had to Florida the day we wanted to leave and a flight the day wanted to come home.

We choose two seats together in row 10, a window seat and a middle.  While the middle seat isn't as much fun as the window it meant we could sit together.

"I went out to eat at a restaurant last weekend with my husband. We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but soon enough we were seated. The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel, and our waiter appeared right after we were seated. She was warm and friendly too. She greeted us and asked for our drink orders. My husband just wanted water, but I got an unsweet tea with lemon. We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on. We ordered our entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. Our waitress took the order, then promised to have our food out soon. We sampled the bread while she was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving, which we are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong. The smell was off and it had a bad taste. I thought it must be bad. I waited until our waitress was coming back by, then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different, because I felt like the salmon was going bad. She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. He said his was delicious. The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely. She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic. She kept checking on us throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert. He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. It was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed our meal, overall. Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal. We tipped generously and left satisfied.

She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. He said his was delicious. The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely. She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic. She kept checking on us throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert. He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. It was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed our meal, overall. Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal. We tipped generously and left satisfied.",How did the food taste?,Everything was good except for the salmon.
"I went out to eat at a restaurant last weekend with my husband. We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but soon enough we were seated. The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel, and our waiter appeared right after we were seated. She was warm and friendly too. She greeted us and asked for our drink orders. My husband just wanted water, but I got an unsweet tea with lemon. We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on. We ordered our entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. Our waitress took the order, then promised to have our food out soon. We sampled the bread while she was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving, which we are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong.

"Going to the dentist was hard for Mike. He was a little bit afraid of going, but his mom always went with him.  When he got to the dentist office, they were all nice to him.  He had to go sit in a dentist chair, and lean back for the lady to check his teeth.  Then she started to clean his teeth with a little machine and a little stick.  The machine made a whirring sound , but it was just water in it, and it washed his mouth out when she finished.  She then rubbed his teeth with a buffer, that made his teeth shine.  It tasted like bubble gum. He liked that part.  Then the dentist came in and examined his mouth, to make sure the lady cleaned them well. He was also checking for cavities.  Mike had no cavities that day, and the dentist was happy with Mike's clean mouth. He gave Mike a bag of things to take home, a new toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss.

"I always want to cook and finally I did it last night. I chose to have an egg-drop soup since it should be easy to do and great to taste. I prepared all ingredients: two scrambled eggs on a bowl, one teaspoon of corn starch mixed with water, a handful of chopped green onion, one teaspoon of sesame oil, a half teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of soy sauce. I placed them in sequence of cooking order so I could just keep pouring them into the pot without messing up orders. Darn, I missed the most important item - boiling water. With water started boiling in the pot, I began putting ingredients in as plan. The soup finished good, but still seemed to be missing something. Oh, it was the white pepper power and black vinegar. It was not too late to add them in. With the final touch, it tasted much better. That was not too bad for my first soup.

With water started boiling in the pot, I began putting ingredients in as plan. The soup finished good, but still seemed to be missing something. Oh, it was the white pepper power and black vinegar. It was not too late to add them in. With the final touch, it tasted much better. That was not too bad for my first soup.",Where was the soup made?,at home

"If there’s one cleaning task I used to put off the most, it was definitely cleaning the shower. I mixed up a batch of the homemade shower cleaner and sprayed it liberally my bathroom shower, which needed some serious help at the time. The homemade shower cleaner consist of  a spray bottle, 1 cup of dawn dishwasher liquid and 1 cup of vinegar and regular water. After I sprayed my homemade solution around the shower I let it sit for around an hour. After an hour, I grabbed a scrubbing brush and began to scrub away all the mildew stains that were in the shower. I find it best that you have the bathroom well-ventilated when you start scrubbing because you don't want to inhale all those nasty chemicals when your scrubbing away at your shower.

"I decided to go camping tomorrow night.  To prepare, we needed to get some supplies.  We took our sleeping bags from the closet, and put them in the trunk of the car.  We packed a bag with food; snacks like pretzels, canned beans and corn, sandwiches, fruit and some water.   We carried blankets, flashlights, hats and gloves to the car, and packed a separate bag with clothes and extra shoes.  We made sure that we had a map that would direct us to the campsite, and extra batteries for our flashlights.  We were only staying one night, but had to make sure we were prepared for cold weather and had enough food.  When the car was packed, we went to the gas station to put extra gas in our car to make sure we would have enough to get to and from the campsite the next day.

"Billy decided he wanted to hang his new painting of a locomotive in his bedroom, he had the perfect spot picked, right above the cat tree in the corner of his bedroom. He held the picture up to the wall finding the perfect spot and marked the center of it with a pencil so he knew where the nail should go. Billy then went to his hallway closet where he had a small dresser where he kept his tools and he picked up a hammer, a nail, and a level. Billy then gently tapped the nail into the wall with the nail angled upwards a little to help hold the picture in place with his hammer being careful not to tap the nail in to the wall too far as it would’ve been hard for him to pull out. He then hung the picture on the nail and used the level on the bottom of the picture so he could make sure the picture was straight on the wall.

"My wife had a stressful week at work and the weekend had finally come. I knew she needed to relax and feel pampered, so I arranged for us to visit the local sauna. I surprised her with the news and she seemed very happy. We both put on some comfortable clothing and headed to our relaxing retreat. When we got there the attendant took our information and asked what services we would be needing. I arranged for massages for both of us and we were given locker keys and robes. We parted ways to go into the appropriate locker rooms and change into our robes and the swimwear we brought along. After changing we had our massages, relaxing all parts of our bodies. Then we both went into a private sauna room and closed the wooden door. There was a pot of hot coals in the middle of the room and we had been instructed how to use it. I took a ladle of water from the pedestal  in the corner and poured it on the hot coals. Steam poured out of the coals and filled the warm room. Soon the sauna was filled with warm soothing steam and we both laid down together on the benches and took in the sensations. We became extremely relaxed and had forgotten about the stresses of work.

"An unfortunate truth of life is that some day we all die. Sadly, I lost my grandmother a couple weeks ago. She was in poor health for the past eight years due to a stroke, and a second major stroke several weeks prior to her death left her completely incapacitated. It was a long distance to get to Wisconsin, so I flew out from New York the day before the wake. All my family was there, including my aunts, uncles, cousins, and parents. The wake was sad, but my family put together photos and a video from my grandmother's life, and we talked about the good times we remembered. The following morning, we attended the funeral, where my uncle gave a eulogy, the pastor gave a sermon, and we sang some of grandma's favorite hymns. We then drove in a procession, or long line of cars, to the graveyard, where we said our final goodbyes and cried. Funerals are always sad, but we get to reminisce on memories of good times with our departed loved ones. Where was the funeral held?","An unfortunate truth of life is that some day we all die.

"Beth and Tim usually prepare dinner almost every night at their house.  They have two children, and when they get home at night from work, Beth and Tim usually start by getting out the pots and pans to cook with.  They look into their refrigerator, and see what they have to cook that night. Last night they picked out steak, some vegetables, and some bread to make a dinner.  They put all the food onto the counter, and started to wash the vegetables first.  Then they cut up the vegetables to make a salad.  They put the salad to the side, and made sure that they had some salad dressing in the refrigerator, so that they could use that for the salad.  They put salt, pepper and some steak sauce on the steak for seasoning.   Next, they heated up the oven, and put the steaks into the oven on high heat.

"The other day was so crazy! I came home and the kitchen was on fire! I guess Dave left the stove on when he cooked lunch and went back to work and forgot about it. But I could see smoke coming out the door the second I got my key out and it was so warm in the garage. I was freaking out, ran out to the car and got my cell phone. I called 911 as fast as I could.

"I was driving home from work when I noticed that the low fuel light on my dashboard had turned on. I needed to stop for gas otherwise I probably wouldn't make it back to my house. As I was driving, I looked for a gas station. When I found one with good, affordable gas prices, I turned in and pulled up next to a gas pump. I took my wallet out of my purse and got out of my car. I swiped my credit card at the pump and chose the type of fuel that I wanted. I put the gas pump into my car and began fueling. My gas tank was almost empty so it took awhile for my tank to fill up. The gas pump clicked off automatically when my tank was full, and I took the pump out and put it back in its place. I shut my gas cap, took my receipt, and got back in my car to drive home.

"My shower was filthy and grimy. Whoa! All that shower dirt had to go. So what I did was, I went over to my local Walmart, and I bought a sponge, a pair of rubber gloves, any empty five gallon bucket, bleach and shower spray cleaner.

"I was thirsty so I decided to make a cup of tea. I looked through my box of teas and rifled through the assorted flavors. I settled on Earl Gray, which is a black tea flavored with bergamot orange.

"I really wanted a painting for my hall bathroom. I decided to order a painting of my girls in the bathtub in black and white print. It took a lot of convincing for my husband to hang the painting. He first took out the stud finder and tape measure. He always wants it to be perfect. He found the center of the wall and the stud. He then took out his drill and drilled the screw in the wall. After the screw was in the wall and perfect, I gave him the painting to hang on the wall. Once it was up I made sure it was straight on the wall. I am very happy with the painting that I chose for my bathroom. It just goes perfectly in there and I was very happy my husband decided to hang it for me since he hates hanging pictures in the house!

I did not want anyone to walk through the room and trip on any of the toys that had been left out. I decided to clean up the toys.

"On a hot summer day nothing is better then going to a swimming pool.  There is one at the community center by us so we can walk there.  Before we go, we get into our bathing suits and put on our flip flops.  We make sure to pack snacks, and towels and drinks into a bag, and grab a float and a ball to play with.  We walk to the pool, the hot day making us even more excited to going swimming.  Once there, we hurry to find empty lounge chairs to put our towels on and waste no time getting into the pool.  The water feels so cold at first, but its so refreshing.  We swim around and realize we have friends there.  We play a game with the ball for a while before getting out for snacks.  We dry out in the sun while we eat and drink and when we are hot again we get back into the water to swim some more.

"Today I wanted to read the newspaper, but I do not have a newspaper subscription.  I decided that the best way to get the newspaper would be to go to the library and read it there.

"Last weekend I woke up in a bad mood.  I went to make some coffee to wake me up.  I ground up the coffee.  The coffee grinder was loud and woke up my wife.  She asked me to make her some coffee too!  I had to grind up some more beans.  I put some filtered water in a microwave safe container.  I put the container into our microwave, which was three years old!  I had to heat up the water for six minutes because our microwave is not that fast.  I placed a filter on top of a coffee cup for my wife.  I filled the filter up with the coffee I had ground.  I tamped down the coffee grounds with my hand.  Then I carefully poured the hot water from the microwave over the coffee grounds.  I allowed the water to soak into the coffee grounds, and I allowed the grounds to come to rest in the filter.  Then I slowly poured more of the water into the grounds.  I gave my wife her cup of coffee when the water was done draining. Did the coffee taste good?","Last weekend I woke up in a bad mood.

"My wife and I have been married for over 50 years and we aren't quite as athletic as we used to be.

"Having pets requires a good amount of responsibility. One of the biggest responsibilities any pet owner has is making sure their pets are fed. This is the case for me and my cat. Just this morning, the first thing I did after waking up was feed him. The cat usually always has a way to tell me that he's hungry.

Once I see that he's hungry and trying to tell me, I go over to the pantry and grab a can of cat food. I use a can opener to crack it open, and then I pour it into his bowl.

"On a bright, sunny Monday morning I put on some light clothes and headed outside to mow my lawn. I opened the garage door, put on my sunglasses, and grabbed a bottle of cold water. I gassed up the lawn mower with my portable gas tank. I pushed the mower into the yard where I normally started to mow. I cranked to mower, and on the third try it started. I pushed the mower back and forth throughout my yard, creating straight and conformed lines. Once I had completely mowed the front of my yard, I turned the mower off and took long drinks of my water. I then pushed the mower to the backyard and started it up again. Making straight lines in the grass, I completed the backyard, as well.

"I had to clean the floor yesterday. Sometimes it seems like a big chore, but once I start it does not seem that hard. I have a lot of throw rugs and pick them up first before cleaning the floor. I fold the rugs so that any dirt in them does not get on the floor. I like to sweep. I sweep all around the floor and even along the wall and corners of the room very well. I saw a spill mark in the kitchen and got a damp paper towel to clean up the mark. It took some scrubbing but finally came off the floor. I went outside to shack out my throw rugs. It was a nice day outside. I vacuumed my big rugs. Some of my floor needed to be mopped, so I did that and let the floors dry.

"Today I woke up and decided to make bacon and eggs for breakfast. I walked to the kitchen and got out all of the ingredient I needed, which included, eggs, bacon, cheese, onion, and green pepper. I placed a skillet on the burner to heat up, and cracked two eggs into a bowl. I threw away the shells and stirred them up until mixed. I also put the bacon in the frying pan and flipped each piece after several minutes. Once the bacon was cooked, I poured the veggies and egg mixture into the pan, stirring occasionally, until the mixture set up and was solid. Once cooked, I removed the eggs and placed them on a plate along with the bacon. I put the plate on the table and poured out a glass of orange juice to go with my meal.

"Just recently, the light in my hallway went out, and since my younger brother is afraid of sleeping in the dark, this became an unnecessary problem. In order to calm him down, my dad went to the nearest hardware store to buy a brand new light bulb. He needed to make sure that the light bulb was the right size, so he took the old, burned out light bulb with him to compare. After finding the right size bulb, he paid for it and brought it back home. He then grabbed a nearby chair so that he could stand on to reach the empty socket where the bulb would go. He had me turn off the light switch, which would make sure that he would not get electrocuted while putting the bulb on or burned when it turns on. After less than 5 minutes, he is finished screwing in the bulb. We flip the switch to see if it works, and it does. My brother was now relieved.
