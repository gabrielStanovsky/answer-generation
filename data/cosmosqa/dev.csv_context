These girls are the women who will lead us to a brighter tomorrow ."

I was rather insulted that they had done this to me and wanted to get on me for not doing it and also for the fact that so many others have probably been some what taken by this also if they did n't look at the receipts .

The stuffing was nice enough , and the fish was cooked well , but there was a bit of sinew or something attached that made it hard to cut through . I do n't know if sand whiting is always like that , or they just did n't clean it properly , but I do n't expect to need a steak knife to eat fish . There was no seasoning on the fish , and too much in the saffron broth ( which was more like a reduction ) that was poured over it .

"Sunday August 31 was a pretty good day for me . I woke up around 10 am . I went on line first I noticed my messengers were n't working , I then tried opening explorer . That would n't work either ."
"Anytime i have had fees in the past ... as soon as i went in to check out more books ... i paid them as soon as i found out . They did n't send me any notice in the mail or anything ... no phone call either . So , i was shocked when i read the email .

'Little did I know until the night before , but my girlfriend \'s husband who ordered the tickets for us managed to get centre front row . We were so close that Piper was a little scared with the loud music and bright lights and hung onto me for dear life through out the entire show . My and my girls just before the show started The next few days were n\'t so much fun with Piper and Brett getting the " back end " of gastro and then it was my turn again . I can honestly say that I think gastro has hit our house 4 times over the last few months , and am now begging you to PLEASE STAY AWAY ! !'
"Just to say that my sister is OK . She 's home now - they could n't find out what was causing her stomach pains and the high white blood cell count . She stayed overnight and for the next day and then they said she could go home and see how she went . If she continues to get the stomach pains we are going to take her back to the GP and see if he will refer her to a specialist or something . Went to Brighton today to meet Louisa ."

'We scrambled backwards , but then there was another explosion behind us . BAM . We heard laughter , and when we looked up , we saw some kids on the roof , and they were hurtling cement construction blocks off the roof and down on our heads , and it was these concrete blocks that were shattering on the sidewalk around us . We took off running , yelling back at these maniacal attackers .'
"Cars and trucks ( it 's a major thoroughfare ) were whipping around them . I was sick when I saw this . It may as well have been a freeway . It is an extremely dangerous road . There have been many accidents and deaths on it , and it is very twisty as well . The baby had light brownish / blondish hair and looked not more than about a year old ."

"I was worried at the time about being mentally unprepared and flunking out , or of being unprepared to juggle all the responsibilities and losing my job , or of something unpredictable happening like my mom dying and not being able to finish what I 'd started . ( I was also afraid I could n't afford it , but getting loans was ridiculously easy . ) None of these things happened , largely because community college is far less challenging than I could possibly have imagined , and so I have an easy success story as my example for taking a risk ."
'On Sunday we went canoeing and kayaking on the river . We chose to go upstream which was also against the wind . We stopped on an island in the middle of the river and had lunch snacks there .'
"Emmy is n't feeling well . I woke up this morning with a little bit of vom on the bed near her mouth . Dog 's puke all the time though , so no big deal .

"There were about three or four of them who spoke to her on an average night . Most of them were from Spain or America or Greece . What 's your name , these men would eventually get around to asking me , when they noticed that we were together ."
"I asked them about it and they said no problem and she could bring the cake to the place earlier that day and they would keep it safe . They offer a limo for the entire day . I seriously could n't find anything wrong with the place . It was absolutely gorgeous and I am so incredibly excited ."
"So I took Mom out to dinner for Mother 's Day tonight ( since I 'll be busy tomorrow with Sam coming back from New Brunswick ) , after finally managing to get her to choose what sort of food she actually wanted to eat . We went to the Fish Market in Byward , somewhere I 'd always wanted to try , and it turned out rather well all told . I liked my blackened Cajun swordfish , and it was very generously seasonedThe Market in general was bustling , even more than I expected for a Saturday night in May. I guess this winter gave the entire city an acute case of cabin fever ."

"So far , no luck . When it gets close I may settle for another breed that I do n't yet have . Or maybe I 'll time myself out and not get another egg before I have four hatchlings again . If the split hatchling turns out to be female , she will be abandoned or potentially up for adoption if I can coordinate that and someone wants her . It appears that server difficulties are behind us , knock wood !"

"I think that before my life revolved around books and writing . Then I hit the real world and now with a job and classes ... I just do n't have the energy to use my imagination . I still miss it though . I do n't want to be a professional ( not that I could ) , but I did really enjoy it ."

I sat out in the driveway a few days with my laptop and snuck on to a neighbor \'s " unsecured " wireless account ... just enought to check email .'
"My brother and I finally saw The Dark Knight last night(we wanted to wait ' til the crowd died down a little ) . And , yeah , it was well worth all the hype -- it was awesome ! Heath Ledger was amazing .... but , how sad it is that he 's not here to see how great he was ."

"They were beautiful lamps but the switch on one of them melted a while back . While they changed the switch for us , one of the lamp shades cracked one night last week , so we decided to get something totally different . They were n't the most stylish but given our bad experience with the stylish and expensive lamps , these would do for now : We had dinner at James Street Market , followed by Campos for coffee and cake . Campos is suppose to make the best coffee in Brisbane ."

'Another hour and a half on the bus to Kasai , walk to the office , then another hour or so ( at least ) of sitting and waiting for things to process while intermittently signing forms and filling out information and finally we were done . Now we just need to go to the post office so we can set up some accounts there and also to pay for the insurance .

'Clive Owen is no longer my dentist . Today I had a little lady called Preethi ( pronounced " Preeeetteeeeee " ) who finished almost every sentence with " please " and told me NOT to brush my teeth after drinking orange juice because the citric acid would make my teeth squishy and my gums would bleed . I still have a dentist fetish though and if my International Rockstar career should inexplicably fail I will be sure to become The Best Dentist Ev0r . The lyrics are not " it \'s a big ad " .'
"The food was unbelievable . We each ordered heaping plates of hummus , pitas , lamb , beef , and olives . It was more food than one person could eat If that was n't enough they load up another plate with Mediterranean fries which were just plain french fries needless to say it was a ton of food .

"Today I was driving up 14th St. near Kensington Road , going about 60 km / hr , when some moron hurled a full ( but open ) beer can at my windshield .

"But cutting her down , right when she was so scared , right when she was so weak , would n't be what he needed .

While reading on the small display is not ideal , it is very convenient and allows me to read while waiting at appointments or any other spare moment . Finding the time to read is very important for technical people , and this fill that need very nicely as I always have my iPhone with me . I had looked at the Kindle for a while , and while I really love the idea , I just ca n't get past the idea of carrying yet another device in this age on convergence ."

"It 's one 's tangible representation to others . You need not be gorgeous to look good . I guess the effort to be clean , healthy and to carry a positive outlook is enough to exude the look that you are taking care of yourself .

'There was also talk of " eventually " catching him and getting him adopted . Well , I tell ya , there is no guarantee that there will ever be an " eventually " for a stray and the busy main street nearby made that possibility even less likely . I knew that not matter how much he may have been clinging to the bushes so far , it was only a matter of time before something scared him enough to send him shooting out into traffic . And after Horatio , I just could n\'t turn my back on that possibility . All that talk about " eventually " and how " nobody could really get near him " ... amateurs .'

'Ever since I left my FT clinical job in March , I \' ve been at Stage " 11"- the bottom of a new chapter in my life .

'Also , Sam \'s shocked he \'s even saying any of this . " You want to go back to how it used to be . " Sam answers for him , and kind of gets it because he remembers when they would just hunt for the sake of hunting - not because they were trying to find their father or because they needed to kill a demon . When they were teenagers , back then the demon was sort of this thing at the forefront of their father \'s mind and more or less at the back of theirs .'

"My nails aching I can feel that and I do n't know what to do ? Even those stupid doctors do n't know . I even met an internal specialist and he said you are depressed .

"The new Youth Specialist was scheduled to begin this week , but an unexpected circumstance means she 'll have to start next week , instead . Meanwhile , starting next week , I 'll be the Lead Tutor for Franklin 's Homework Hub system , which means more hours than last year , and more money per hour . Most of my extra duties are things I was doing anyway , and I 'll still get to spend some time in the Teen Center .

'I thought I would have to be top seed in that group by being 1750 or so . Discounting Randy as the favorite , any of the rest of us can easily win , making for a potentially really exciting event .

'At one point , Tizzy terrified us with a shriek , " STUCK ! ! ! " Establishing that both of his feet and his hands were , in fact , free as they should be , I determined correctly that he was , hanging by his knees , suspended precariously between the narrow gapped spindles of a porch railing .

'Yesterday on Marketplace , they were broadcasting from outside Lehmann Bros. in New York City . They mentioned that as former employees were coming out with their stuff in boxes , not only was the press chasing them down the street with cameras trying to get a comment , but tourists were actually snapping photos . I know how horrible I felt the two times I was laid off from a company I really loved , believed in , and had put my whole heart into .

"The backdrop is of post - war Germany and all of its peoples ' homecoming tales , and later , the nation 's divided self reuniting . The book touches on evil , justice , ethics and morals and the place of each in both the psyche and the modern world . I related to the protagonist quite strongly ; his ultimate decision reflects my own approach to dealing with my father 's behaviour , and for many of the same reasons . My only criticism is that the female characters , with the exception of the protagonist 's mother , while believable and real , seemed a little two - dimensional , a little too straightforward in their complex world ."

In addition to this , we also had a small photo booth where we could take reasonable quality photos for customers .

"Today ( April 17 ) I left my trailer expecting the usual roasting sun and temps - we had a steady climb into the 90s last week . Instead , I found this : The temperature must have fallen 20 or 25 degrees overnight . It is quite pleasant . The dust has an odor that 's not completely an odor : it 's like walking into a woodworking shop where someone is using a very fine grit power sander ."
"My family 's dog since I was in high school , Gingersnap , was put down this morning at 9:30 . Ginger was a big sweetie with a very expressive face , stubby legs with big paws , and a wagging tail that would beat you half to death .

'She sat up and sighed , knowing that this would be a difficult morning . She made her way downstairs , not bothering to change , and found a perfectly put together Miranda pouring searing coffee into two mugs . " Good morning Andrea . How do you take your coffee ? "'
"They had gone through my phone and called dad to notify him of what happened , but he would n't have been able to come get me in a timely fashion so he gave permission for my lab teacher to take me home . They gave me two bottles of water to drink on the way home and also some contact numbers in case the light headedness did n't go away or if I started throwing up etc . I found the humour to it , but mum was slightly less amused when my teacher dropped me off lol . Now for something completely unrelated , why is it that all the cool characters with awesome costume design belong to shounen - ai or yaoi titles ?"
'And that included themselves . If nothing was said it could never be wrong , and by not expressing verbal insecurities their bodies learned a way of letting each other know what they wanted , needed , craved , feared ... getting along in silence was a bond that would live with them forever , but tonight forever was too strong a word for two carefree , curious and close friends . John moved and broke the hug .'

'I saw a bust of someone standing in the middle but did n\'t stop because I was in a hurry to take pictures of the school , afraid that it will be too dark for good photos when the night approached . All the offices and classrooms were closed . I was walking along the quiet corridor when I saw a notice board saying " Working Class . No entrance " Perhaps that \'s a late class .'

"Blaming Democracy Thursday , August 14 , 2008 ; A16 YOU MIGHT think , at a moment such as this , that the moral calculus would be pretty well understood . Russian troops are occupying large swaths of Georgia , a tiny neighboring country , and sacking its military bases . Russian jets have roamed Georgian skies , bombing civilian and military targets alike . Russian ships are said to be controlling Georgia 's port of Poti , while militia under Russia 's control reportedly massacre Georgian civilians ."
"I mean , I went to my Catholic Catechism class last Thursday night with no bra on -- I did have a sweater on to conceal that fact -- but the fact remains -- I went to church with no bra on and no one cared .

"I ' m a huge fan of the imperial cream ale , then with the sample of imperial stout , about 5 distinct flavors and a aftertaste that kept on going , and that was n't even carbonated yet . A little bit later , he placed a glass in front of me . FREE GREAT BEER !"
"I feel not even second place to the bottle but more along the lines of fourth or fifth . He cares about the bottle , he cares about that fucking piece of shit drunken druggie slut whore whom he calls his girlfriend , and he cares about himself before he cares about me because if that was not the case he would be upstairs right now and not calling here probably drunk and angry from some payphone . He lost everything to drinking , everything . He lost his jobs ( he has n't been able to keep a job in years ) , his children , my mother who was with him for over 23 years , his health , and still he s too blind and selfish and stupid to stop ."
'The next day we spent taking it easy and doing a little more shopping . I was a bit disappointed that it was harder to find gifts to bring back than I expected . I had expected cool beach gear to buy the kids , but found more ` americanized goods ` that would appeal to European visitors .'
'My parents came to visit today ... We went shopping . I had 1 thing I needed and ended up with a lot more .... No more spending until I get to Vegas !

'Whether there is any baby Hartnell , I am not sure ; I am unsure of all my Doctor - voices except for Ten , and a lot of One \'s mannerisms are very old - man in nature . Anyway , what I set out to write has very little bearing on what I did write . What I actually wrote , after discovering my frustration with explanations for the Master such as " the girl he was in love with ultimately caused it " ( TM George Lucas ) , " he was just always a bit evil and crazy " ( TM JK Rowling ) , and " he was bullied as a child " ( TM ... psychologists profiling serial killers ? ) , was my own origin story .'

"See this movie . It 's great statement about recycling and the environment and extremely funny too . And sometimes cute and heartwarming , but not too squicky . Even though it 's probably for kids there 's a lot of adult matter in the subtext . I also saw You Do n't Mess With the Zohan ."

"So if we ca n't go , especially because of a technical hitch , then there 's nothing anyone can do , but I will not be a happy bunny . I may have to go use some Scientologists for dart practice . Talking of , I finally found out exactly what Scientology is today , hence my new - found lack of respect for them . Basically , it 's just like every other religion I ca n't fathom , or more to the point , that I can fathom , but can not understand why the followers can not see that their religion is not the divine truth , but adult fairytales created so that people could have a socially acceptable comfort blanket , as it were . Anyway , apparently Scientology is basically Buddhism with aliens , executed with a typical cult format ."

"Next spring I plan on planting some zinnias in the back next to the fence , and some marigolds in the spaces up front . A close up : I have been wanting to do something with the front yard , instead of the ugly junky bushes and weeds that were there already . There were a bunch of big rocks right up next to the house , so I pulled those out to make a border , and planted some flowers I got from my parent 's house . They are moving soon , and rather than loose all of my mom 's flowers , we dug some up to put at my house ."

"Yes , I had to stop often , but that was the plan all along - up 2 flights , stop and cool completely down ( read a page , maybe ) , fan myself madly , then up another couple of flights ...

"They were all talking about their Christian Ministry and the Church to which they all belonged ; discussing the politics that existed within the hierarchy and how best to approach some of the problems of accepting both themselves and others and giving to God .

"The initial greeting and sipping coffee in the office takes about 15 minutes . If there is a welcome ceremony , it is about ten minutes . The schools where we have lunch have a built in activity , but if we arrive at 11 , lunch is n't until 12:30 , and then we stay until 2 ."
'I was sleeping under a mountain of the softest sheets in the world when I was rudely awakened by a pleasant tingling sensation .

"Even though I was n't buying for myself - I leave Wednesday morning for Nashville and except for a day to turn around will be away though mid - August - I walked the entire market to look things over . During the afternoon I was at Union Station for hotel departures ; I guess I 'd forgotten , but that Grand Hall is beautiful .

'I want to see him , but I \' m so scared to hear what comes out from his mouth .. I keep telling myself to " be positive " , " be happy " ... Maybe he \'s just sick of seeing my depressed sad face and hearing me nag . But when I think back to the way he treated me , was there any way to avoid acting that way ?

"It is played multiple times a day in this homestead . And well , other than Hope , Coffee and Melody ... you know I need my chocolate too .

And it was overpriced at $ 20 ."

"Seriously , I ca n't tell if girls actually just enjoy playing around with him while he tries to spray water on them or if they are just going along and having fun with it because girls are not used to beginning conflict and not tolerating what someone is doing . I ' m going to guess some of both . Oh , and this guy has a girlfriend back home who apparently takes care of his every need and is the best girlfriend ever and cute . So I and two girls hanging out with him half - jokingly asked what does she like about you , why is she with you ?"
'The Olde Boar \'s Head in Middleton is a venerable institution dating back to 1632 and its stone flagged floors have seen many comings and goings over the years .

"Last night I fell into a very deep sleep and this morning I woke up and instead of being sloth - girl I got up and ran at a proper swift pace for an hour . I was back at my good running pace rather than the trudge I ' ve been dragging myself through recently . Thank goodness . I listened to the whole of the Super Furry Animals album Phantom Power and then a spot of PJ Harvey ."
"Maybe they were out of the normal bread . There was a lot of juice so I thought that maybe , just maybe , if I continued to dip the dripping bread , the juice seasoning would mask the overpowering flavor of the bread .

'We need to ask our patients to exercise more days in week , we need to talk to our patients about the need to be the vanguards of their health . Ask your patients to recite their blood pressure reading at every visit , ask your patients to tell you about their weight changes at every visit , ask about detailed smoking and drinking habits . When you call your relatives in the village ask them if they know their blood pressure readings , if they answer no tell them to get it checked and get back to you .

'His friends who helped him out with it were all incredibly hilarious . Some were french like him , one was Australian , and a couple others were Americans they happened to pick up in New York . Phillippe Petite still performs to this day .'

"I was really happy with the race considering how tired I was going in . It was also fun trying to track Conrad down . I knew there was n't really any chance of that but it was cool knowing he was the only one ahead me and I was actually racing against him ."
"Uber has been in my life for twenty years or more . At first , I really did n't like her . She was everything about an end - of - the - eighties professional yuppy woman that I could n't stand ."
"The strangest thing that has happened was when they were singing the Chinese National Anthem she was standing in front of the TV swaying and singing ... the words were n't really the words but it was kind of freaky ! I asked her is she knew the song and she said yes : ) She also is screamed fireworks a lot ! ! ! She did enjoy naming everyone she knows who is Chinese too ( that took a while LOL ) and she was so cute as the parade of countries happened ."
'Continuing with the story ... As he approached this lady , she said , " well , are n\'t you a cutie ? " She continued by asking me , " Why are you dropping him off ? " I responded by telling her the story of how he was " waiting " when we got home . She said , " Well , please do n\'t take him in yet . Can I spend a few minutes with him . I was looking for another animal but was waiting for someone until I went inside . " I was glad to do it because my goal was to find a good loving home for this wonderful loving dog .'
'We laughed , we got serious , we joked , we drank mountain dew and listened to an older - man duo with guitars at a coffee shop . ( We left because their loudness was invading our conversation . ) It was simply a great great day .'

"We went out last night for dinner at my favourite restaurant , Watt , to celebrate the bonuses we both got from work . We got ourselves a bottle of Verdelho and started with the same entree - scallops crumbed in sesame seeds in a wasabi sauce : Then we went onto our mains . I had a king snapper pie type thing and Sam had a duck curry : As usual , Watt did n't disappoint . We polished off every single bit of our dinner . We then went to Freestyle for their famous desserts : I had the upside down pear cake while Sam had the chocolate souffle ."
'While at the last CDA meeting talking about the MOU , it was made clear that things are moving along . Slow , but they are moving . I was happy that the city is looking at putting a provision in place that if Wal - Mart would decide to close the store and move that we would not be left with just an empty building . I would like to share an email I received that poses a question with Alderman Sean Smith leaving .'
"One day , he did just that , taking the first exit . Unfortunately , this was useless to us , since we live in New Hampshire , not New York . Most people who were so clearly committed to a direction would continue on their path , take the first exit , and reverse direction . At least that 's what I would do ."
'Sorry this update too so long . I have out of town guests until Sunday night . After they all left I went to my sister \'s to play with my new " Toys " . I did n\'t get home Sunday until late and I crashed .'

'Apparently I signed up for a credit card through citibank sometime in 2005 . I sort of remember doing this , but either never got the card in the mail or threw it away as soon as it came in . I would get statements from time to time , but usually just threw those away too .'
"Today was Faye 's birthday . I made banana bread last night to have with coffee this morning , and Bev made a chocolate cake ( to which she added apples and fennel - surprisingly delicious ! ) and Yelena made vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce and drove out at lunch time to deliver it . Faye seemed very happy with all this , and of course everyone else was very happy with the delicious food ."
"Let 's see I like sports , cartoons , and cheesy sci - fi movies , so all I need is a picture of aliens playing volleyball against a bunch of cartoon animals . Which is just strange enough to be a fairly accurate representation of my personality . I even fail when asked to describe myself in a single word . Ummm tall ?"
"It would have been easy to close the distance , control the center , and stack the deck heavily in my favor , but I played soft . Sparring time is too precious to waste on that old dilettante bullshit - fight or do n't fight . Nothing in between . On the up side , I learned that putting all that weight on my shield foot was limiting my offensive options , so I ' m going to a more balanced stance . Also , I figured out the mechanics of a funky off - side shot that was used against me at Pennsic , and even managed to score with it once or twice ."
"Monday , September 8 Better late than never , do n't you think . These are the photos of the necklace I made in class last month . It matches the earrings I posted earlier . Made with bronze colored 8/0 seed beads for the base and embellished with 11/0 seed beads ."
"Even that young , Peter had realized where the anger came from , why Nathan was only ever truly angry with a few people around him , why he was always far more upset ( emotional ) with Peter than anyone else . Peter 's always known one thing for sure in his life , one utter certainty and that is the simple fact that Nathan loves him , completely and totally and despite everything , it 's the one thing that he 's never once doubted . The hours before the explosion ( his mother and his brother and the doubt that had crept in ) had shaken that belief but his brother had pulled through , had been the man who had checked him for injuries years before ."
'Either way , the contents were inedible . " Uh , I just went to the store if you \'re hungry . " Kanji offered the bag with his meager dinner to Kei , not even considering that it really was n\'t enough for two people to make a meal out of .'
'Right before my alarm was supposed to go off , I heard a strange mewing sound . I thought it might be one of the bigger cats playing too rough with the kitten , so I jump out of bed to break up the fight . Except ... there was no fight , and the mewing continued , and when I followed it into my office I realized that Mama had given birth again . Now , this pregnancy was not a surprise , but she was looking much more tiny than the last time .'
'Afterwards , when I loved again , it was invariably with much reservation . In fact , I have never loved whole heartedly any more . I lament , I hold back , I back off , I isolate or insulate myself . How fruitful or fulfilling can life be then ?'
'My youngest sister and I have always been really close , and we agree on things like , say , disabling the air conditioning immediately on entry ( so freaking cold ! ) . We kept the screen doors open at night , and fell asleep to the sounds of the ocean . I still dream of that .'
"Cor had logged off by that time , and my stomach growled loudly . Reminding me that my last full meal had been two days before at lunch , snacks and water did not count . So I told Jen I would be back and headed upstairs for breakfast . Ordered fruit salad ( lots of mangos ) , a mango lassi ( hopefully mangos ) and nutella on toast ( I ' m almost certain there were no mangos ) . A little too much sweet for me , but filling and made me happy ."

"Something to cheer about : I finally finished my first X - Files vid ! Woohoo ! ! ! Something to jeer about : Back to work tomorrow . ( It would n't be so bad if I could just go to my office ; instead , I 'll be subjected to at least half a day of meetings and administrative pep talks first ."
'There are trees and bushes and plants and grass growing all over , throughout campus , downtown , everywhere . I can hardly see the building across the street through my dorm window because there are too many trees . People smile at you everywhere .'
"But also there 's my waist , and my bust , and my calves . The negative : now people really know that I ' m fat ( as if they did n't before . ) The positive : now they know what my fat really looks like , and that I do n't expect them to be scared of it or repulsed by it . This is n't meant to be a fat manifesto ; I do n't speak for all fat people 's experiences because I ca n't ."
"I ' m all excited about new fall colors in clothing , as well as fleshing out our house a little more with some certain items ... Instead of going on a crazy bank breaking shopping spree , I decided to draw it all to get it out of my system temporarily ! If you would like to see the larger version , its here on my flickr . Very laid back lots of resting type of weekend . Chris was off working at the Faster Mustache 24-hour urban race and I was home alone for the majority of the weekend ."
"It seemed quieter , but that 's most likely because the Iron Chef celebrity tour bus was n't there . Actually , some of the usual market vendors were n't there , either . I do n't know if it was the crazy week , dehydration , or both , but I felt fairly miserable when I arrived , so I hung out for a bit and then took it easy on the ride home . After I got home , I sat around for a brief while and then set out again for a second round of errand - running and grocery - shopping ."
'If I am concentrating and focused I can make out 80 % of what is being said to me . This makes the show of nodding and saying " Oui " or " bon " almost convincing . Of course , the instant I spy a shiny metal object , my attention is dragged away from the speaker and I am lost once again . Terrance , however , makes real and authentic attempts to speak in French .'
'Roses were the flower of the day , hot pinks and light pinks with chocolate brown accents . Ryan joined Erin on the dance floor for their first dance together and as the sun began to dip down into the horizon . I love the look on their faces as they shared this intimate moment together dancing for the first time as husband and wife .'
'I was informed that Pickle naps every single day at rest time which blew me away because he quit napping at home a good 7 months ago . His teacher , magic . My mom is having surgery on the 30th for a torn rotator cuff . I have been popping over there now and again to see if she needs anything .'
"First my ENT finally offered me the deviated septum surgery , which will be happening soon . Then the periodontist turning out to be extremely nice so that I actually got the gum graft I ' ve been putting off . And now this guy convincing me to try the ring , not to get my period more often ( dear god , I ca n't miss any more work from it -- who wants it 12 times a year ? )"
"My only reservations lie with the financial situation , otherwise I would LOVE to go up there and just have fun with Jan. I ' m also excited to learn how to snowboard / ski all over again . Since it 's been about ... 8 fucking years ."
"Max was pissed that I did n't walk him though . He 's too big , and he killed a dog down that road , so it 's best he stay at home . It started to rain , so we only made it to the stop sign ."
"This one is linked to being to the bus stop first , so that 's usually not a problem any more . One other thing was that the woman 's house where the bus stop is has a baby swing on the tree , and he and the younger girl try to set ' records ' by winding up the swing more than the other . Audrey always says she wins , and Paul always breaks down . She 's quite the antagonizer , and her mom has to keep yelling at her about that ."
"A lot of stuff has happened since the last time I posted ! I ' m sorry I ' ve dropped the ball on that one - in my defense , we did go on vacation and drive halfway across the country . That did take up some of my time !"
"Of course , he had him in the boat all day . Meanwhile , I was cleaning out the studio . The mice had been quite active there in the years I have n't used it . Took me most of Saturday and half of Sunday to get things into reasonable shape and sort out all the clay materials ."
'However there was one pair of black capris that I knew should fit me . They were very tight on me last year , so I thought , oh yeah they will definetely fit me this year . So I pulled them on thinking I could still wear these to work , but as soon as I had the zipper done up and let go , they dropped back to the ground . So in the long run .'
"I remember going out the back door and having to walk around the building . It seems like such a real memory , but I know it never happened . What I do n't know is why I have dreamt about it at least twice , and possibly more times that I do n't remember , when I have never actually been there . Most of the time my dreams are just strange and do n't make much sense , but there are times , like last night , when they seem earily real or that they are trying to show me something ."
"Finally , even though we were having so much fun , it was time to leave and go pick up our little peanut . Debbie 's friend Nancy was kind enough to watch her so Mom and Dad could get away for a night . Thanks so much ! And congratulations to Dawn and John ."
"It sounds cliche , but I really meant to post . At first I was just whatever , I 'll post tomorrow and then it just got worse . I tried once at the end of July but when I got here and started writing I broke down ."
"During the actual part of the concert I let loose . I danced around , played air guitar , did crazy moves that correlated to their lyrics and jumped up and down banging my fist in the air to the beat of the melodies . My heart was so alive and free that I could n't stop smiling ."
"I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL oh fuckin shit i did it . I waited so long to be done with high school and be done with getting up at fucking 6 oclock every morning . I ' m so proud of myself that i graduated i never really doubted that i would n't graduate but I ' m just glad its done and over with . Naomi comes today and I ' m about to go leave and pick her from jfk and I ' m excited but scared haha she can be so much fun or make the day miserable ."
"The air is a bit thin , making exercise ( like climbing mountain passes ) a bit of a challenge . We entered the basin via the Grandview Trailhead , with a 4 mile hike back to Betsy Lake where we established camp . Here 's a map of the area : We reached the trailhead at about 11:00 , when the boys decided to have their lunch before hitting the trail . We ate and put the finishing touches on our packs and took off ."
"Has he already done it ? Is he already dead ? I ca n't swallow when my mind asks this question the first time and the second time it swirls back around ; I am finding it hard to breathe . Then that voice is back telling me that I still have time , that I just have to find him before it is too late . And I have to believe this because , even though it seems unlikely that he would still be alive ; if he is not , there is no hope for the world ... or at least not my world . This conviction that spread through me gives rise to other questions ."
'I had gone to the Library briefly yesterday morning to see if Storytime was in session . It was n\'t , and I did n\'t stick around to get a card . So , last night , I started reading Farenheit 451-which may come as a surprise since I \' m generally not known for my fondness of sci - fi . It \'s really " hard sci - fi " that I do n\'t care for , and it \'s not for any other reason than it simply is not my cuppa . It \'s nothing against the genre itself . But this book could be more my speed .'
'This guitar is in brand new condition , plain and simple . I bought the guitar in Jan of this year . Guitar is just not for me , so the guitar has sat in the case for months .'
"One group of 12 mothers had cesarean sections and the other delivered naturally ( vaginally ) . All women were interviewed and given brain scans two to three weeks after giving birth . During the brain scans , parents listened to recordings of their own baby 's cry during the discomfort of a diaper change ."
"During the twilight hours on Sunday evening , G and I took a walk on Castle Island . After having so much rain the previous few days , the weather finally cleared up and we figured it would be a nice time to visit . Castle Island is located in South Boston , which is practically a walk from Quincy , but I had never been there . It 's also very close to Logan Airport , so there are planes flying overhead seemingly every two minutes ."
"So there 's no denying we went to Rome ... yeah yeah , everybody looooves Rome ... Got ta tell ya ... Did n't love it , was kinda nasty ... We were excited to arrive in Rome , escaping unseasonably bitter Autumn weather and a top of about 3 degrees in Finland ... It was hot , sunny , Italian , what more could we ask for . After waiting for an hour for our bags to make their leisurely way from the plane to the terminal we made our way to the Leonardo Express , the direct train to Termini , Rome 's Grand central railway station ( I wondered what LDV may have thought of his cartoon face emblazoned across every carriage as we rocked and rolled slowly into Rome ) ."
"At work , I keep hearing a metallic / wood block sound that Rebecca tells me originates in the vents . This sound reminds me of a percussion instrument that is used in Air 's Universal Traveler , and every time the knocking starts in the vents I expect accompanying guitars . What a wonderful punishment it is to be caged inside of my head . I was offered overtime to help hand - jacketing a shipment due by midnight ."
'I think I would like to do a run of this nature again in the future and if Susan is my running buddy that would be even better . Thanks Sue ! You planted the seed , helped me plan a training schedule and were there through the whole thing . Jon sent me these beautiful flowers for completing the race .'
'This wireless adapter is placed on the back of your Xbox , by usb . I had wireless network at home for years , It was great to have my Xbox any where in the house ! I had to take down my game room and so no more Xbox live for me . Well for now .'
'I think I need to switch up putters and filling the wedge gap in my bag would be nice . Apparently , my putting style best suits a toe - down putter vs a face balanced putter , which I have right now . So , that might actually be the next purchase .'
"Before Anna and I had started out that day , we consulted with a park ranger and another expert of the area who 'd been hiking it for years . He 'd told us about two paths that were little known - one off the Cottonwood grove that took us to another pass that went through a gap in the mountains , and another of the mountain gap trail that would take us around the mountain to the Aztec cave ( just a name for a large cave ) . We easily found the first one but the second eluded us even after we trailblazed awhile . Part of the path we took as we trailblazed ."

"So I had to order a new one . Craap . Last night was so relaxing . The group went to Old Chicago and then chilled on the riverfront for a few minutes . Went back to Juan 's and I took like a 15 min long hot shower ."
'But knowing it was a sales ploy I had to decline and leave , but I did enjoy it . So good luck to her this young lady who said she was from Israel , hence I suppose why the salt was from the Dead Sea . And I admit it worked my hands were soft and the dirt cleaned out of my pause . I now wish I had the money , for the interaction it would have been worth it .'
'Other than the spiritual experience , it was a great experience hanging out with the entire MM team ! We had loads of fun and hilarious experiences ! Wah ah ! And I can not imagine i actually drove in Malaysia !'

"My friends Mary , Joey and their Mom Carol gave me a special new dog bed for my furry friends . They outwitted one another to try to be the sole occupants of this lovely new gift . It 's something I would not and could not have purchased on my own . It 's so special especially to the elder bodies .. I shall post the fight for the bed on camera critters . I needed a small loan yesterday ."

'We woke to the glow of sunshine outside our windows . Monday was moving day and we were blessed with an exceptionally nice day for travel . Sunny and clear , on the way out of town , we stopped at the Denali overlook and saw that Mt. McKinley was almost completely visible , save for a thin gauzy veil of clouds wisping across the mid - section .'

"Our house was built in the 80s ... does n't sound important until you realize that the predominant architectural style in our neighborhood features huge , single pane fixed windows that DON'T OPEN . We have two rooms in the house that have windows that open ; the roommate 's bedroom & the sunroom . Yes , the same sunroom with the fucking leaks . But that sunroom already had a window unit in there , and the leaks were already set up with basins to catch the water ( and it did stop raining hard pretty quickly ) ."
"I ' m finding it so hard to lose weight nowadays . It 's my fault for not finding the time to exercise and not having the discipline to diet . I might as well check out diet pill reviews because it might be my only hope if I do n't go on a diet nor exercise ."
"Taylor was upset and I did n't know where to go , so eventually it was decided that I would come over , I got to about Greenwood then got off the bus and crossed the street to catch the other 48 . Then I got to the 73 stop and people liked talking to me . This old , really nice woman started talking to me and smiling about the bus . An old man stopped in front of me and said a bunch of things , laughing and I did n't understand him ."

"Ever since Paul died , my dreams have been devoid of him . I ' m pretty sure I ' ve dreamt of everyone else since then , except for him . It really bothers me that my dreams have become so silent in that regard . I interpret dreams as alternate realities - if your mind is what makes things real , I figure there must be a reason why we dream so vividly some nights ."

'For those who do not have children , you may not believe that I could still feel incomplete with three little rug rats running around . But each child is so special , so unique , that there is a definite void when one of them is missing . And yes , Andrew , Sean , & Ryan have kept me very busy while their oldest brother has been away .'
"I do n't know how I ' m going to get through it . She was supposed to be in like all of my classes . And to top all that off , graduation is set for June 12 , that 's the day Lara passed ."
'Nonetheless it was clear from the Russian broadcasts that Russia views itself as the defender of the small break away region within Georgia , while the US views Russia as a ruthless aggressor , and disregards the sheer irony of that view . Neither media talks about oil too much . Maybe I m oversimplifying a complex situation .'
"I 'd like to remain friends but I do n't want to pursue a relationship . I feel she may be more interested in me than I am in her and she would therefore text / call me to hang out more . I do n't have experience with this , so what can I do to not hang out with her more so it seems like I want to date . At the same time I want to remain polite and not a douchebag ."
"I got home for a week and things were fine , and then Shannon 's parents ( who are very religious ) found out we were dating . That turned into a big guilt trip for Shannon with her parents and she ended up breaking up with me . I was / am in love with her so I knew it was n't the end . Both of us were hurt , but neither of us wanted to just let it go ."
"I actually ordered two dinners , so that I 'll have something to eat tomorrow morning , since I do n't have so much as an egg to fry for breakfast tomorrow . I ran out of rice a while ago ... maybe a week ago ... yikes ! Here are some stories that are not mine to tell , so I wo n't tell them ."
"Sorry Obama , the poor state of the current economy belongs to you and your party . Second , President George W. Bush is our president , not just John McCain 's . He 's our president and commander - in - chief ."
"I saw Elliot once on my rounds , but I have n't seen her since . That 's probably a good thing though , she seemed kind of mad . I was n't really looking forward to being here right now . Not after being called Nancy and Bethany and Belinda all day . But here I am , I just wish I could figure out why ."
'I go to Him every time , find rest in Him . And whenever I read the bible : the thing that strikes me every time again , is that He is faithful , trustworthy , never too late , powerful , etc . etc .'
'He then asked one of the forensics ont he scene to bag and tag it . He then went to the sherif , " i have pieced together what i have just seen in this room with deductive reasoning to create a relative thesis .'
'" So I got up and started to get ready for our hangout . I grabbed a handful of Chex cereal to tide me over until we got dinner and then started choking on said Chex cereal . Not just like , coughing and feeling embarrassed that I had choked on goddamn cereal . No , my throat completely closed up and breathing became a real concern .'

'Something about sparks and big fireballs , I dunno . So we sat on the airfield waiting for the lightning to move off into the distance . For an hour . They were nice enough to bus Peyton Manning out to us and he gave everyone on the plane a hug .'
'He took 7 samples from various sites on the organ , and then told me to wait until the anesthesia wore off . I was dizzy and a bit nauseated . Robert came to Brooklyn to accompany me back to Manhattan , and then the Bronx .'
'Then we walked around the mall and saw some pretty interesting things ... first there was a huge line outside the mall but when we in the line just magically ended . Still have no idea about what that was about . Some kind of sports thing , I think . Then we walked by KB toys and saw a sign that they had original 1980s My Little Ponies . O_O ... We probably spent too much time thinking over if we should get them or not .'

'Apparently another flight or two was cancelled and they were all placed on this one to DIA . Shoot . I wait in line at the service desk to see what they could do for me . I saw lots of people yelling and becoming irrational so I did what I always do and thank the person for being there and helping me out before I even talk to them about my situation .'
"I was starting to think he would n't call me again this week but when I got back from the meeting at work he had left me a voice mail message . Do n't know where we are going tonight . One of the girls asked me how I was losing weight . I do n't think I have lost weight , but I told her it was the migraine diet ."

'A lot of how that works can be tied to the environment in which you do it , and so we got to talking about the long dry Summer in Los Angeles , with a particularly hot spell we were going through at the time we were talking . It affects how you work , what part of the day is most productive for you , and so forth . We agreed that a rather nice thunderstorm would be a good thing to have come along , even though that was highly improbable .'
'And then God bless the head server who came and chatted with me even though he was not confidant in his English . We even exchanged some German phrases . funny ... since I understand and speak more Spanish than German . But ...'
"When the spoon did n't work he used his hand ! A man who respects and defends the stash of his knit - crazy wife is a great husband and should be showered with gifts . My stash is just located on open shelves in the linen closet ."
"Well since I had an extra cell phone around ( the ex 's cell phone ) , I offered to sell her the phone and allow her to use the existing cell phone line and number since it was still active as long as she paid the bill monthly . Well the so - called friend agreed and now we get to the cream of the crop of this blog entry . Well , the young lady was doing a good job paying her bill from January until April . I know it 's August now but what in the hell happened in May ?"
"I ca n't climb the stairs without wheezing . Ever since my doctor implied I was ready to have the baby at any time , I read way too much into every ache and pain . Could THAT be the start of a contraction ? What about THAT ?"
'I should be home around eight or check and see if lunchbox is here and let him know where this should be . The game plan is to be ready for the shed in two weeks or whenever Chris and Cisco are . I still need to look at a color scheme and such .'
"I have known too many people -- mostly women but also several students of both genders -- who cut themselves . My school never seemed to know how to handle them -- usually by washing bloody items and ignoring it happened -- but I tried responding with compassion . They did n't need someone to judge them or use their self - injury as blackmail . What they are going through is beyond my ken , but not beyond my caring ."
"It 's been forever . I have no idea how we got here , but I 'd never go back . Thank God you came along when you did , sweetness . You are a miracle ; if you had n't come along when you did , I 'd be under a bridge somewhere right now ."
'He was somewhere his bodyguards did not think anyone would find . He was going to try to remain there for a few days until the talk of his attempted assassination was long past . He knew better , though , of course he did .'
"I was just reading Hippy Chick ' 's blog about her weight loss after lap band surgery and I want to share my experiences with weight loss . Warning : it is not as compelling a story , so you might be a bit bored . I was a thin child and teenager . Heck , I even regained my figure after having my first four children ."
"Last night 's Reading Fest warm - up show was probably the last chance anybody here in England will have had to see MGMT in a relatively small venue before they return in November for a full tour , and my God was it worth the trek . Oxford 's recently converted and renovated Carling Academy is on nothing like the scale of their other venues ( Brixton etc . ) , and the benefits of brand new sound and technical equipment are incredible ."
'So I sent my greetings and salutations via Ron to Tommyboy . We arrive at the parking lot and Park Blvd was lively with club goers and happy drunk people . It was a festive night between the Flame and Numbers .'
"I really ca n't wait ! Last week was torture with the 14 hours of overtime , and I ' m not doing any this week . I ' m hoping to just coast through this week at work with minimal issues , though most likely that wo n't be the case . Tonight I ' m getting my hair cut and colored . I ' ve never colored my hair so this should be an experience ."
"It 's like riding a bicycle - I was pleased to discover . After so many years , it all came back . I ' m a bit rusty technically and completely out of shape , but it feels good ."
'Far from bustling , it had a ghostly desolateness about it . As if the people were clinging to one last hope of industriousness .

Pointing to a wheel on the side of the street , he proceeded to tell us : " when industry was done everything is finished . "'
"The 1st year is a lot of trial and error and there 's no big mystery about teaching that is learned at a teacher 's college . Besides ... YOU have the teacher 's manual ! We are so blessed and there is so much to choose from ... too much , at times ."
"i was really hurt by this and i was devestated and i told him so . He said its cuz he was really frustrated , so i slapped him and said ' so you think i m frustrating ? just cuz u want some does not mean you go behind the woman you ' love ' to get some . i ca nt believe you would do this to me ."

'I have always known that the road to greatness is in having clear , specific goals that at first seem impossible and scary , but are realistic . My experience has shown me that unmet goals can really frustrate and lead to stress and quitting . I have been guilt of this all my life .'
"My latest job is with Family Skill Builders and I get to be a so called super nanny for families in the DHS system . Even though I am an employee I still retain scheduling flexibility because they have no office and all client visits I schedule and are in client 's home or at a DHS branch . In fact one of the job qualifications was to be a good self manager because you wo n't have someone looking over your shoulder ... that fits me ! I invested in a itouch ( business write off a perk of self - employment ) so I can sync my calendar from Outlook and listen to music of course ."
'I found out last night after stopping at the local Ace Hardware store . After I left the store and was putting on my gear , some guy pulled around and backed into the parking space immediately in front of me . His car had a HUGE Harley Davidson window sticker on it and I know he backed up in front of me only to make a statement . Well as he got out of his car , I had already started my Guzzi . I roared off and onto the road where I opened her up !'

'I finally had a convertible car ! Life could n\'t get much sweeter at that point . My husband at that time Jeff ( he later passed away from a car wreck ) and my eldest son Barry ( 19 ) wanted to take my convertible car on a test drive . Jeff was very convincing , having Barry behind him saying " Aw come on Mom ! " did n\'t help much either .'
'We \'ll see how long they keep it working ... Anyway , so all weekend I \'d been keeping track of one particular bag and putting anything " important " in it so that if I needed to access it , I could just go to that particular bag . Well last night at 11 I realize I ca n\'t find it . It has my phone charger , a copy of my lease , a copy of the contract for the house , and various sundry other papers that I really did n\'t want lost in it .'
"We got organised a bit this morning and then headed out into the city . It 's not that big a place , so we ' ve found that our hotel is quite well situated - nothing is near , but most things are quite close . Wandered down Lombard Street - a very , very curvy road . San Francisco is very hilly - almost ludicrously so . You get great views from the top of streets looking back down though . Explored the Fisherman 's Wharf area ."
"about it . about this ... idk , the first heart beat i think i ' ve felt in a while . I know that we 're gon na be apart for a little while , but now i thnk i have more drive than anytime ever . and i know i said that i was n't going to set myself around a boy ... but if it makes sense , this is n't for him at all ."

"She did not drive it at all that day , and I have also installed previously a battery cut off since she has a slow drain somewhere in the car that I do not have the technical know how or time to fix . Today , she calls me again and it wo n't start again . I go out , turn it over , and its not firing like yesterday . I pull the plug wires and check for spark , no spark ."
'Forever the quiet person . She spoke less than 10 words yesterday i think ... and lastly , SISTER ! ! haha ... poor Oi Yin was the only guy who turned up . He was so bliss to have dinner with so many girls .'
"Tonight I met my cousin Richard . Really , we knew each other before , but a five year old and a nineteen year old with a mowhawk , well , it did n't really work out then . Ca n't believe they are finally here , do n't know how long it has been that mom and Laurie have been talking about it . What it made me think of was the eternal potential for redemption ."

"I was n't thrilled with the color selections ... black and off white , but it made it easy to decide which colors to buy . I 'll be putting my scrapbook stuff away for awhile and get back to making some more bottle cap pincushions . On my way to town I drove by the garden center and suddenly remembered they have a farmers market on Saturday mornings . There were only a few vendors , but they had what I wanted !"
"She has a terrible temper problem , and when she 's angry she breaks things and can even become violent . Today , she came to me and she was complaining about my dad and was insulting him and I could see she was getting angry . I told her how I think she has an anger problem and needs to see a doctor or someone to sort it out and then she became very angry and started shouting and she almost hit me and then she told me to pack my bags and leave and go stay at my dad 's place . She blamed me for her and my dad fighting and told me that I ' m vicious and she described my aunts and grandma ( on my dad 's side ) as ' bitches ' and she said I ' m full of venom ."

"Just a note before writing this , I have written a new page about my daily routine that you can click on to the right . Also , a note - last week Friday I was able to wear my -5.5 glasses to our quarterly lab seminar day ! This is material progress , as at the last one I could n't quite read the slides with my -6.25 glasses and would sometimes use the -7.00 glasses ."
"My sister and I have n't lived to together since she was nine . Now , as young adults , our shared eccentricities are precious gifts each time I stumble on one . To suddenly discover this amazing young person who came to many of the same conclusions as I , but from a vastly different path , almost makes up for being absent from her youth . At the public library where I do most of my writing , there is an elderly man , maybe in his seventies or eighties , who comes everyday to spend hours on the Internet ."
"Within the year or so before I lost all of my hearing , even that was n't a guarantee ... there were many times I could feel the vibrations but heard nothing . It was a real triumph when I was able to put my head near Beanie and hear her purring a few weeks ago ! She 's one of those cats that purrs with gusto , and now I can easily hear her purring even if I ' m just near her in the room . Thanks to my cochlear implants , I no longer have to rest my ear against her chest ."
'We were talking in class yesterday about Transnational history and envisioning a world without the Nation state . It made for interesting discussion . And it occurred to me that is particularly important to think about Nation - less history in terms of the last 20 years given the development of the internet . With people communicating and relating in a whole new spacial realm we will have to analyse their ( and our own ) experiences of the world differently .'
"I actually sort of understood the poems we went through in class , which made me feel good :D It was very interesting as well , the way we went through the poem , so yay !

'They donate wigs to women going through cancer treatments ( they also only require you to donate 8 inches ) , which was exactly what I wanted . After having two beloved aunts and a dearly loved grandmother all suffer through breast cancer , I knew this was the right choice . Tuesday afternoon , I walked into the salon and said au revoir to ten inches of my hair . Ten inches that had been with me through all my infertile struggles . Ten inches that mocked me for failing .'
"So disregard the fact that I ' ve known her for so long , that her boyfriend used to be a friend of mine and saw her behind my back , that she enjoys being with me , etc . Basically , if seeing me violates that image of herself in a perfect relationship , she 'd rather just not . But I ' ve seen her suspend those plans temporarily at times ... and she 's only done it for me . That one kiss we shared , I initiated it ."
"He is 10 months old and is testing us big time . By that I mean he is going the bathroom in the house and here is the thing , when my brother comes to visit he sleeps on the couch in the living room where the dog stays while he is visiting the dog is a peach .

"Wendy Carlos 's Switched - On Bach is one of those rare novelty recordings that never gets boring . In the capable hands of Carlos , Bach 's keyboard masterpieces sound like they were made for the otherworldly blurps , farts , and chimes of a Moog synthesizer . And , in a sense , they were ."
"Recently , while dining on my now - cold meal ( do moms ever eat warm food ? ) at our loud , chaotic supper table after a typically crazy day of spinning my wheels , I looked up through the happy chatter ( and clatter ... and beating of the platters ... ) and caught my husband 's weary , laughing eyes .

"So , I woke up this morning feeling much refreshed . I still took some NyQuil before going to bed , but I slept through the night and had no breathing problems that I can recall . Both sinus rinses today proved I am getting better and Luke gave me some Lysine ( along with a multi vitamin , a glass of cider and some scrambled eggs ) to take this morning . I ' m going to fly med free tonight and see how I do ."
'This was another park with a nice path , grass , and water . We convinced some ducks to come hang out with us with some Cheese nips from our flight that I had been carrying around .

"Which means : Happy Supernatural Day ! ! ! ! ! After being in a crappy , pissy mood all day yesterday , I ' m in quite a good mood today . I had one more meeting with my adviser , who said that basically I only have little things to work out and fix in my thesis before I turn it in ! I was so afraid she was going to say I needed to re - work my conclusion ( again ) and was dreading doing everything at the last minute ."
"I just wanted to share with you my blessed day of God 's favor in the ordinary that made it extraordinary ! I had a meeting on base this morning and then had errands to run on the base .

'He did n\'t speak as he set their drinks out , but a smirk teased at the corner of his mouth . " How did you know it was us ?

"Was n't it just Monday ? Someone call the gub - ment . Someone stole Tuesday through Thursday . I do n't know how we got to Friday so fast ."
"But it just makes me feel unimportant . Unless I have something really important I almost always go out to his house to look after him or just cuddle with him if he 's sick . It just does n't feel like it 's reciprocated ."

"I started to laugh , but then I remembered that teenage boys are in my future as well . How would I react to a shaman son ? Would I too cry about it at the corner coffee shop ? Hard to say at this point . The boys are both feeling better , so tomorrow it 's back to day care ."

'I had to cancel the interview and take Em home because she was so unhappy . I \'m sure there was no symbolism whatsoever involved in that dream . On the up side , Emily is totally on board with going to the zoo today ! It \'s unbelievable , considering what a homebody she \'s turned into . Plus she \'s still in her jammies and is playing her favorite computer game , so those are other factors which might make her say no .

"I have a city teacher friend who 's class room had a better library than the school 's . I picked up a couple of books on music , biography and computer stuff .

"Instead of the aforementioned drink that we were going to have at the Swissotel , we ended up at a music bar called Timbre instead . Brilliant live jazz music was played tonight and it was n't too loud for the ears , in fact pleasant and soothing for a change . The place was completely packed so we were too embarrassed to photograph ourselves but we definitely had a great time and look forward to returning there soon . On our way to Timbre though , we heard a random catty remark from a small group of white girls who were walking towards the direction we came from ."

"It 's not how hot the summers are here as much as how long they go on . Temperatures started topping 100 degrees in May this year , and for a little while it 's bracing . You think you 'll fight it out , but by August you are desperate and the sun seems to hang smug and sullen at dead noon all day long . There 's a vicious , personal quality to the heat of these late summer days , like summer has it 's teeth in your neck and it 's going to shake you till you 're limp , wring the last bit of juiciness out of you before , if we 're lucky , it dies in late October ."

A whole third of the book is taken up by the children trying to figure out where they are and finding their way to their old castle . In the movie , they know instantly , and find the castle instantly . This is interesting , because in this part of the book there was a lot of ( rather nice ) depiction of childlike reactions and emotions to an unknown situation . Being scared of dark , being cold , hungry , thirsty ... nothing of that featured in the movie . And that was a good thing . Because of this there was no temptation to see the children as children .'

The legislature can , of course , enact statutes that trump court rules if necessary .'

It 's probably the most satisfying character arc I ' ve ever seen , through it 's development and the stage it 's currently at ( oh , redemption ! ) Honestly , as a D / G person , this is clearly the way I wish Draco 's character had gone , instead of just the ' bad apple ' direction JKR chose to take it , with just a few teasing moments of awesome in the sixth book ."

Then yesterday the same group of people and I went for a really long run in the morning , and then I came back , showered , ate some lunch and then did some business , then came back and did nothing . As in , I watched two movies ( Immortal Beloved and The Namesake , which are both good but The Namesake is really really good ! )'
"I mean the other people in class may not know as much about computers as me but I thought a lot of the stuff was more remedial than that . The professor has a thick accent too so it was hard for him to get his point across to the other students . I do n't mind foreign accents but I do n't like interpretting for someone just so class is n't hung up for 45 minutes ."

"Since I have n't quite figured out my way around these country roads , I stumbled upon a short cut to Nampa , the much - bigger next city over .

"It 's my own fault for not asking questions about the entree , but for some reason , I did n't think the fish would be fried . I actually thought it would just be coated in something crispy . My initial reaction was n't positive , but I will pretty much eat anything , so I dug right in . The cod was good , but like I previously mentioned , pretty average . It reminded me of fried fish meal from an Irish pub ."

"We had a lot of fun with that , and our team won . Monday night , Chuck played tennis , and Tuesday evening , I went to High Lane for the women 's tennis , but there was a group of four women who made their own foursome , and eventually two other women for the main event . One had pulled a muscle earlier in the week , and figured she would be better off not playing . So I ended up playing two sets of singles against Jennifer , a woman we know from church ."
"At some point in the middle of the night , I was awaken by what sounded like a very muted ambulance . My first thought was my watch , so I put my wrist up to my ear , nope , not my watch .

"Also , I ' m really pissed off at Brett Favre . He should ' ve retired but he just had to play so he left the Packers . So now I want the Packers to have an AWESOME season and I want the Jets to suck ( which did n't happen Sunday -- they beat the Cardinals 56 - 35 ... wtf ? ? ? ) . Of course , it 's also cool if Favre plays awesome cuz it proves the Packers front office wrong and that 's kinda cool cuz they were kinda jerky to Brett a few years back ."

Well , I did do two things ."

"It was a quiet late afternoon weekday with about 4 other tables being occupied . Of course , apart from ordering coffee like The Fluffy ( espresso with milk and lots of foam ! ) ...... we could n't resist sharing a slice of Tiramisu ( RM14/USD4.20 ) which is usually the safest and yet boring choice when one has trouble deciding .

'This past weekend , I do n\'t quite know why , my feelings of neglect and being taken for granted were just too much to take and I lashed out , holding nothing back . Yet , despite the bruising and sensation of emptiness I felt yesterday , reading the column this morning ( " We \'ll Marry Each Other As Often As Needed " ) left me with a bit more strength and warmth than I possessed before , a little more faith in him , in us .

'Although the late fee was under $ 3 , I could n\'t help thinking this was all a ploy to charge me a late fee . In 2007 , I paid off my car and received an envelope from Toyota .

'Bell Canada is in some hot water over arbitrarily , and without notification , started using throttling and traffic shaping to limit the congestion on the internets that they perceived . This congestion , they contend , is caused by P2P file sharing . The catch is that since Bell has a virtual monopoly over the entire phone network in much of Canada , the restrictions they put in place were also arbitrarily placed on all DSL subscribers connected to the Bell network , even people subscribed to a DSL provider other than Bell . Naturally , people were not happy , including the CRTC . They have asked Bell , politely , for the data used to make this one - sided decision .'

"Again , I manually adjusted the settings , but after re - start second monitor would be off . I Re - installed the drivers ( 8.9 ) and CCC but still could not get it to keep the settings after re - boot . After hours of trials and frustrations I figured out that ATI will keep my dual monitor settings ONLY if the resolution on my primary monitor ( Acer ) is set to 1440 X 900 or below . But I know that the card is capable of running both monitors at their native resolutions because I can go into CCC and manually stet the proper resolutions - it works ...

"I called AAA and then my step - father and it just turned into a giant fiasco . My brother had to come pick me up and the car has to stay there overnight ( because the garage was closed for the day ) , so that means we have to get up early , so we can drive there and unlock the gate and see the car get towed away . Then , because the garage only does oil changes on Saturday and they 're closed on Sunday , the car will have to sit there until Monday , which means I do n't have a car for the rest of the weekend ."

'After about a half mile I started actively trying to hitch - hike while continuing to walk / jog down the road 15 minutes and 20 cars later , I finally got lucky . A Polish couple on their way to Derry stopped and welcomed me in . They took me as far as Coleraine , and were even kind enough to drive me into the town centre .'
"Olivier readily admits ' I was extremely lucky . You almost always need a lot of tournament experience to win such huge events .

'I tried to make some jokes , but they fell super flat . ( " I do n\'t get raped because I live in Williamsburg , and all the guys there are pussies .

"It 's wonderfull and I ' m loving every minute of being able to drive my own vehicle without an instructor telling me which exit to take . I think I ' ve been driving carefully , although , I may have got a bit too exited and taken a corner or two faster and in a higher gear than I should have . I ' m still getting used to it and I imagine it will take me a while to calm down and for it to sink in .

'Yesterday Jesse and I made a cake ! It was carrot cake and we made it for Stacerella . Basically he came over a couple hours after work , and we went through the recipe box and looked at all the cakes . We figured Stacey would get upset or stressed out at work , and we \'d bring it to her and be all " SURPRISE ! Be happy !'
"I was kind of tempted to tell them to bloody keep me in again if it was all going to be such an issue . I had started to aclimatise now to hospital conditions , I had slept better last night and was beginning to enjoy the people watching opportunities not to mention getting better acquainted with my fellow inmates .

'If you really want to eat something like lettuce , it has to be washed first in a diluted bleach solution , which in Bolivia at least can be brought in most supermarkets and pharmacies .

Most people just avoid lettuce and other fresh non - peelable veg altogether . 5 ) Meat and dairy .'
"The food was aweful but we enjoyed it so much , after being hungry all day long ! Kriti had the perfect body and I wondered how she 'd eat so much . I would stare at her blankly when she 'd be eating morsel after morsel and I 'd just let her keep going because I always she 'd get fat like me ."
'I decided to pace myself from the start and resisted the temptation to attack any hills - it proved to be a good plan , and I reached the first feed station after 20miles feeling fresh . I was rather perplexed to discover that the goodies on offer were not free ( as was suggested in the literature ) . I checked my pocket for money ... none to be found . I had a quick drink and continued on , worrying about how long I could continue without sustenance .'
"The first Shinto shrine contained three awesome statues that were about 30 feet high , made of wood and covered in gold flake . Of course we were n't allowed to take pictures . If there had n't of been anyone else there I would have though ."

"And to go to some weird engineer party that I did n't fit in to at all . But they all thought I was really cool ( all these aging baby - boomers who are into engineering ) they did n't really understand me , it was like I was a foreign being and it was really funny . All the CUboulder kids were partying , and they 're fantastic . I can NOT wait to be up there ."
"Though yesterday was the first time I saw Recipes by Cafe Metro at Shangri - La Plaza , I ' ve encountered the brand in the past before but never tried it . The name Recipes somehow did not attract me . Yesterday , however , was different . The place has just opened and looked very new . It also seemed like the perfect place to sit and read a book ."
"Now things get weird . We drive in circles around the school like five times , and I pointed it out to the driver who proceeded to call me crazy for thinking that he did n't know the way to wherever the hell we were trying to go . Well somehow in this circling we arrive at the house and it 's filled with even more of my friends who seem to be getting ready for a party .

'This morning when I woke up , my asthma was sooo fucking bad , I was about ready to tell my mom to take me to the hospital ... I hate the hospital . I despise the hospital .

Then I did the treadmill in the fitness center , and went for a swim - the pool is really cold now , but it 's kind of refreshing .

We moved into an apt and the tech come out to install and said due to the line of sight and we ca n't get landlord consent to drill that he could n't perform the install .

"I survived Saturday and ended the day with a lot of fun . Work was boring and I stayed busy with housekeeping type things like putting used stickers on books and putting away the massive amounts of hangers that had stacked up . Steve decided he only wanted to stay open till 1 and we even closed a little earlier than that so things went well on that part . Last night we decided to play peanuts . It was a small turn out but I do n't think it could have been much more fun ."
'I was thinking about how many people in the USA , I mean in the many places I traveled last month ( DC airport , Colorado , Las Vegas , So . Cal , Chicago ) , were dressed so poorly .

"I met him in the chatroom . He said he was feeling lonely , and meeting other lonely people would make him feel better , even if it 's just for a while .

"I think 80 % of it was nerves and maybe 20 % weather ( the high pressure made for unstable air and a lot of thermals ) .

And now that she 'd noticed it with that surety in mind , panic was n't going to wipe out a consciousness of her half - naked state .

I looked up and saw a bank of thunderous dark grey clouds , and coming from the clouds were seven or eight tornadoes , all coming in my direction .

"I still remember when I was working as a receptionist dealing with a child at the desk , and a woman walked up behind the child and started speaking at me straight over the child 's head . Yes , I am going to stereotype , but she looked like the kind of woman who would have been livid if a child had done that to her .

I think the same issue about uncertainty is at the root of the popularity of creationism ."

"Transport is my biggest problem in this job . Although it 's 30 minutes by car , that 's really the only way to get there .

The speaker , however , was loud enough to overcome this problem most of the time , even with our windows down ."

"I left in the rain and it 's been gray or coming down most of the past two days . The various surges of aroma that typically shock your senses now hang in thick and constant in the humid air .

"I took pics along the way , and when I have time , I hope to post a diary of its creation . I do n't know if its a period shape or not , but I was so thrilled with it I just had to share .

It 's a burden but someone 's got to bear it ... For those of you who were asking me about the cost of the Best Buy and Target exclusive versions of Supernatural , here 's some info that may help in your buying decisions . First I should note that neither Target or Best Buy ONLY had the exclusive versions available ."
'It was quite the escape about 250 miles on a gorgeous day taking it easy on back roads . When I filled up I calculated 44 mpg and now have gone 170 miles on a 5 gallon tank with out the low fuel warning light activating . So fun and relatively frugal .'

"We were only 22 when we met , now we 're 29 . We were VERY close for the time we were together , We were very much in love , and I shattered her heart , ( and mine too ) But I was n't ready for the bigger picture , And honestly I thought I could do better . I wanted to play the field ."
'Most of what I am seeing here is ugly . Most people who visit St. Petersburg will see beauty , swanky dressed women , wearing the latest fashions , caked in makeup , drinking out of straws and looking coy . Well built , good looking men , in top shelf clothing , holding their women gently , staring at you with a power look . Phone shops everywhere and everyone on their mobile phones .'
'In the dream , I was spending the night at my aunts house and I slept on the couch in the living room . The couch was in the big window and it was facing the street . Kinda like a window display at a store . So all of these guys were walking by and making comments and yelling at me .'
'He is , as has been previously noted here a fine fly - fisher and a fine gillie . Shortly a tubby man of a working - class nature came a - tugging at my elbow , seemingly to offer casting advice . How on earth would a man of this standing know a single thing about fly - fishing ? Fly - fishing is the exclusive pursuit of toffs is it not ?'
'Tired of my " Musings ? " Haha that title is quite lame but it \'s the only thing I could think of . I suppose I could put actual titles that relate to the subject of my entry instead . o : Would n\'t that be a novel concept ?'

'I said something really dumb the other day and I feel pretty stupid for saying it . There was a painting that I really wanted for my birthday and I told someone at work " Well , I told my parents so OF COURSE their going to get it for me . They always get me whatever I want for my birthday . "'

"Then we were reminded by our agency that they are outside the age range we listed on our home study so we 'd have to do an addendum to get approved - which would delay things . After much prayer , we decided to wait for more children to choose from . We feel like the Lord told us to adopt between 4 - 9 so we need to stay with that . That has been a little hard ."
"Summer ' 89 - I quit going to church . No one cared , no one called and it 's not like they did n't recognize i was n't there . Truth is , I did n't really like their church anymore than they liked this unrepentant sinner with long hair . Maybe they did n't feel this way , however , their silence towards me leaves me with this impression ."
'this is to remind u to make good use of this weekend to study . u have 80 days left to A levels . work hard . from principal " .'
'Today a lady at the nursing home I volunteer at told me that she was miserable and wanted to die . I met her on Wednesday at a foot massage event and scrubbed her feet and painted her toe nails . She was really quiet .'
"Well , my CP is now officially over . Today was my last day , as tomorrow I check out of Patterson . Therefore , I felt it would be fitting to spend my last day at Studios . It was n't too bad , although Mother Nature had other plans ."
"That book was about 2 inches thick and I finished it 10 minutes before I left work that day . On Tuesday after I came back , I hit the bookstore and bought the first and second books , Elizabeth loves vampire things and the set really is a series aimed at teens , and very clean , so I thought she 'd enjoy them . I finished the 2nd book that night . I stopped by Wal Mart on Wednesday morning before I went to work and bought the 3rd one ."
"I must say that it 's a time consuming and labor intensive process , since Mastro Livi virtually makes everything by hand , and if he does not , he still needs to adjust practically everything to the razor being made . After finishing it , Mastro Livi and I decided to proceed with a shave ... well , what can I say , this scary looking razor delivered a silky smooth shave , exactly what I wanted and nothing less . I wish to thank Mastro Livi for the wonderful experience he gave me this past saturday and I look forward to watching the edited video ."
"I went to the hospital yesterday because I ' ve been so sick . I have n't been able to keep solids or liquids down , and my lower abdomen was hurting real bad . I ' m 35 weeks pregnant so they kept saying it was all pregnancy pains ."
"I walk in , find a UPS delivery note stuck to my letterbox , and get my laptop ! ( yes , Christmas came early and now I have my laptop ! ) Stoked , I go out to meet Mita and the Russian , who are in a bar waiting for Sanjeev 's Rock Band party . Sanjeev turned 29 , and was hosting it at Brian 's big blue house , so we were all going down there for a night of Rock Band , drinks and debauchery ( minus the debauchery ) ."

'The whole time I was searching for " real food " like a burger , chicken fingers or pulled pork ( hey , it was a splurge day ! ) , but I never found any . I probably did not eat enough food to counteract the whiskey - never a good idea .'
'Travelling with Small Children has been an adventure , all the more so because they \'re so darn cute and say the most hilarious things ( " I had to stop going down the slide after two goes because a bug came near me " ) . But even more adventuresome than travelling with two Small Children ? Travelling with an unexpectedly pregnant lady ! Very interesting indeed .'
'In fact I \' m sure even real die - hard fans who \' ve had high expectations for the film will not be disappointed ; it \'s * that * good . ( click on pic to enlarge ) My beautiful " date " and I enjoyed the film thoroughly - we giggled and laughed out loud ( & silently cried ) together as only girls can do when watching a girly film . We both dressed up for the film - I wore a satiny dress as a tribute to Carrie ( & Sarah Jessica Parker ) , while my friend dressed rather Charlotte York - ish .'
'No , Finn ( as we called him on the radio ) and I are not back together . But we are still friends . He is moving to Houston for an awesome job opportunity so I stopped by his house before his going away party and met the new puppy , Missy ! When we broke up , he took Sammie the Yorkie and I took Regina the Poodle .'
"School is like a sanctuary to me , its the only place where i m able to be without worrying about her . Almost everybody likes me , I do nt start trouble with anybody . Today i was nominated homecomming prince for my class but I could n't do it because I ' m still grounded ."
'When I was a little child I ran around in that exact area . This particular park brought back so many unforgotten childhood memories . My brother , my friends , and I used to go to this park all the time . We mostly played soccer , and had so much fun doing it .'
'Haha . Porn . He nearly called in sick for work but I needed a shower and to sleep properly so I made him go . The kids outside saw me going the night before to his , then saw me the next morning in the same clothes .'
"Am really annoyed with myself . I kind of knew things were going too well . I have taken two steps forward and one back , but i ' m not giving up . I will keep working at recovery ."
"This entry is nt about work , but I feel I need to get it off my chest . So Moped Will and I are talking online , and he wants me to come over again . At like , 11:30 pm . I ' m hesitant at first , but eventually I say screw it , and go over . I get to his street and give him a call , tell him to come outside , because he lives in one of the worst neighborhoods in duluth , and right in the heart of it too . So he gets all pissy about it but he comes out anyways ."
'A Good Day for Grocery Shopping Now , let me make something clear right from the get go . I have never thought that models were attractive unless they are Plus Size models . The chicks on television and in magazines are so damn skinny these days they look like they could poke an eye out with all those sharp angles . Me , I much prefer a woman with curves , lots of soft spots , and beautiful hanging breasts .'
'While I was describing the procedure for taking a quiz , I heard one of my students say , " He \'s strict . " I was pleased by that comment , and by the relative silence experienced during the quiz . I have been described as " nice " by this and other students , and since nice is seen as a sign of weakness by my students , I \' m glad at least one was able to see me as strict . I have high expectations for my students , and if being strict helps prepare them for success in high school and beyond , so be it .'
'well i woke up to him still puking , feel bad now he s really ill . i was sooo drunk last night , i did nt have anything to eat , and drank half a bottle of rum with diet coke . i ve got bruises on my face , chin , forehead , where i was hitting myself . ca nt realy remember the logic behind it , at least i havnt woken up to another cut .'
'Well , first day of 2008 and I seem to have started it with a heavy cold . I woke up yesterday not feeling that great , and had a nap in the afternoon to try and shake off the sense of fatigue . I then started feeling very out of sorts around midnight last night and then developed a headache . I went to bed , woke up at 3 am this morning when some new year revelers decided to bang on my door this morning and I then felt very bad indeed .'

"I have great people here like D and his friends , who have graciously welcomed me into their lives , and the friends I ' ve made through my small group . I need to find a church that I love , but that will come . Best friend L is just a plane ride away , up the coast in San Francisco ."
'I really think every weekend should be a three day weekend like this one . I really loved this weekend to death . Manoel came up Friday and took me to get my test in New Haven . Then he took me to get a cinnamon crunch bagel at Panera and it made the test all better .'
"Kind of like when I was 5 and left my bike parked outside of the townhouse where we lived in the ghetto . The next door neighbours were moving and the guy backed over my bike with his moving van . Apparently , he nearly peed his pants because he thought I was on the bike . I was n't ."
"i do n't know who is going to read this . even if anyone will . but this is my attempt at losing the weight i have put on . okay a little bit myself ... please do nt give me lectures about being active here , i already make sure i do some sort of activity everyday , at least an hour per day ."
'He agreed , but first wanted to dial into my computer , after which he giggled at my desktop background , which I happen to love : I , getting pissy , said " So now you know I \' m Catholic " which seemed a cue for him to launch into his own views . You \'ll be glad to know that he believes in God , Jesus and the second coming . He seemed surprised that Arthur and one daughter are atheists and that I had n\'t made them Catholic . I said " It \'s a free country " and that seemed to stump him .'
"It 's not like I was n't going to vote for him . Hmm . I suppose I had nothing better to do!That next and the following day I had the whole house to myself and felt ill from the muscle strain and wetness , so naturally I lounged naked and masturbated in new and exciting places . Ok , so I did n't , ( just in the old and dull places ) , but I watched a few movies and ate an entire box of spaghetti ."

"it 's silly how i can be scared of a trip i looked forward to for so long .. from it being NZ , to taiwan , to finally bintan .. guess yea he is right . the best i can do for both myself and klaw is to be myself . be myself and not worry about any other thing . be myself and enjoy myself ."
"Lori , Gwen , and I took the Vocational dorm . We lit those big red strings of firecrackers off ( almost ) simultaneously and threw them through every gate of each dorm . It was freaking awesome . We did n't get as much of a reaction as we had hoped for , so we went back and lit off several Honduran bottle rocket ish fireworks . Travis had pretty good aim , getting them to go off right over the boys ' dorms ."

"Granted , the noodles were a bit different in that it 's kind of harder than normal noodles . Not hard in a bad way , it was ... tangier ( if there is such a word ) . Personally , I prefer the one at Lagoon . Maybe Uncle Rick has n't tried that before . On a side note , the stallholder thought I was Uncle Rick 's younger sister ."
"There is a cold going around and I came down with it this weekend . As far as illnesses go , I give this one a 2 out of 5 . It was enough to ensure that I stayed in all weekend and did nothing productive , but I ' ve definitely been more sick . This was really just a stuffy nose and an extra bit of headache on top of my usual baseline discomfort ."
'How did it get so late ? I have to be at work in an hour . " I scream , and frantically get read for another slow night at the bar.~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~what was I thinking ? Bam thought to himself . I just met her and I already want her .'

'It is easy to see why motorcycles are appealing to a large number of people , old and young alike . These vehicles are great for heavy daily commutes because they are small and maneuverable , making it possible to weave in and out of traffic and split lanes to get ahead of the crush of cars that are otherwise stalled . This practice is not only legal , it is encouraged as a method of relieving congestion and getting at least a few motorists off the roads faster , hopefully cutting down of pollution as well .'
"For years Mother 's Day presents have been a challenge for me ; my folks are older and in assisted living now . Even before they moved , there were few things they truly needed , so presents had taken the form of favorite perfumes , boxes of candy , restaurant gift certificates or cut flower arrangements . I ' m not sure my parents ever used any of the certificates and after a while , with multiple children and grandchildren facing the same present dilemma , the apartment was overrun with flowers and candy ."
'Endy Chavez led off the 9th inning against reliever Heath Bell . The next batter to step to the plate was third baseman , David Wright . There were two outs in the inning and Endy was standing at first base . The count was 0 - 1 and Wright launched the ball , deep down the left field line .'
'So it is very often that we hear about stray / abandoned cats and dogs that have been adopted off the street , and it is usually a heartwarming story . But I must ask ... how often do you hear about someone taking in an abandoned goldfish ? ( Yes , I did say goldfish ) Well that is exactly what happened this weekend when my mother and I were walking into the grocery store and i spotted something purple sitting next to a trashcan . When I got a closer look , I realized that it was a small critter carrier with a small goldfish inside .'
"The whole back of the basement still needs to be cleaned out ( we have a refrigerator and a freezer from when we moved in , a broken tv , a bed frame , and a table that all needs to be hauled away to the junkyard , empty storage bins that need to go up in the attic , j has a storage bin full of clothes he needs to go through , and there 's tons of cardboard boxes down there that need to be broken up and chucked in the garbage ) . And this needs to be done this week before the pool table arrives because I need to move the cats litter boxes from the front part of the basement where the pool table is going to back there . Right now there 's no room ."
"We had a bunch of visitors today , and they all just left . Afterwards , Bruce and the girls crashed , so I took their pictures . Do n't they look cute . I think this is the first picture of the three of them together ."
"I asked him if he could drop me off at the far entrance on the other side of campus and I 'd just walk the rest of the way home . He said he could and so I hopped in the backseat . I know , the thought running through my mind was ' this guy could be an axe murderer ' , but I took my chances . Likely would n't have taken my chances if it had been someone just in a random car ... but even that logic is faulty , since the assumption that people with uniforms and in those kinds of positions are ' safe ' lulls you into a false sense of security ."
"So no bands have even played yet and my day is already pretty ruined . i saw a few bands but i could BARELY see half of them , and the other half i could n't see at all ( including mayday parade 's set , i could n't see them whatsoever . ) i went to their signing and whatever ."
'I also started last night so cramps were radiating into my legs causing me to have some very odd dreams that I thought I would try and write down before I completely forget them . Note : They absorbed into many different scenerios , so I will try my best for them to make sence . My first few dreams involved my sister , and my dad . They were a bit scary , and I had a hard time recovering from them and realizing that I was dreaming for about a minute or two . Rachel and I watned to go swiming .'
'The other day I vowed to spend ten minutes a day doing something for the election to support Obama . So , I called my grandfather , because eight months ago he said he was going to vote for McCain . I wanted to have a conversation with him about it , and just hear him , and let him know how I felt . I was really surprised , because one of the first things he said to me was ; " You , your husband , and your new baby are going to have a good life , because change is coming . " I asked him what he meant , and he said , " Obama is going to win by a landslide , people want change .'
"D : When we got out of the train station , I noticed that THE BANK WAS CLOSED . So no money again . In the end , I wound up borrowing forty bucks from Michele and I have NO IDEA when I ' m going to pay her back : I owe her , Adri , my parents , AND myself , and on this pitiful salary of mine , I do n't have the chance to save so much as a PENNY ."
'HOLY GUACAMOLE GUYS ! I had my fingers on the trigger the day WAMU was acquired and their shares dropped under $ 0.20 to buy a couple thousand worth . I was THIS close to doing it . Got cold feet at the end and did nt go through .'
'WordPress Affiliate Pro You Need this program ! Finally it became a dream come true . I had been struggling with learning some of the ways to install and tweak Affiliate Programs on my websites . It has been a bit of a struggle and if I only knew about WordPress Affiliate Pro before this it would have bee so much easier !'

"Hello dears . :) I just wanted to give you guys a quick update on why I ' ve been MIA . First thing 's first , I was pretty much MIA last week because I had to prep for my boyfriend 's company party . It was their company party commemorating their 15 year anniversary and it was held up north in nor - cal ."
"After a couple weeks on our mountain bike vacation , we 're home . We had to cut it a day short because my right leg started hurting again ... seems to be a muscle strain again . I 'll get to the details of that in a few days ."
"I arrived safe & sound without much muss ' n ' fuss . I caught up a bit with my friends & their dogs , ate some pizza , watched a cool flick and then fell asleep . So far , I feel at home . The pizza at Pizzicato I chose was the veggie pizza . It had the standard mozzarella and tomato sauce , but a nice addition were the pepperoncinis ."
"Though I ' m more experienced at it now and as they get older things get a little easier , it is still challenging handling the kids on my own for more than a day or two . We had a great day yesterday riding the ferry , hanging out in San Francisco and getting ice cream in the afternoon . And today the kids were really good , building castles with legos , playing very well together and reading books while I got some chores done around the house ."
'No amount of spiritual guidance , counseling , friends or family would have been able to fix us . I woke up for 4 years not recognizing the person in the mirror anymore . I had poured so much into my marriage and felt more empty than ever .'

'The only energy I got out of him today was him fighting not to go into that carrier . After being scratched I went and got a bath towel and wrapped him up in it . Immediately he went limp in it , like he was tired and grateful to be swaddled and lowered him into the crate .'
"Cause I ' m through to the third round and I ' ve counted at least 7 who did n't make it this semester , which brings the grand total up to 11 . 11 out of 48 since last spring who ' ve been held back , dropped out or failed out .

"We lost all the stuff in the fridge and it 's not like we stocked up big anyway , just what we usually had in the cabinet , you know . And we lost all the meat and milk and eggs , I did n't want to save any of that , you know ? Did n't want to get salmonella from it or something ."
"We went outside , I cried outside ( and he then kindly told me I should go inside and watch Futurama ) , we went inside , I cried inside and he asked what was wrong , I said I did n't know , he said I was a liar and just not telling him , because that 's what happens usually . Anyway , I really did n't know / do n't know what was / is wrong with me . I do n't know . I ' ve been having a really weird day ."
'One of the people at home group on Wednesday night was talking about times in your life when the door of opportunity swings open before you , a chance that does not come your way often , a time in your life when rapid growth and change and the favour of God and men rests on you in a special way . And it is those times when you fling yourself through the doorway with force . You go ahead full speed , you seize the day and the hour and the minute , you ride this grace for however long it lasts , and you put your back and your legs and your heart into it so that you can cover as much ground as possible .'
'The other person kicks lightly . Then same but to the side , doing round kicks . Various reaction drills - two people shuffle sideways - one person leads another has to follow , and the goal of the leader is to confuse the follower - so shift to the left then right , etc .

"This morning I surveyed the damage . You always panic with these things , knowing there is probably a ton more damage you do n't see , but in this case I think I lucked out . I was alert enough to slow down when I saw the deer so there is no damage to the body of the car , just the headlight ."

"I seem to have at least temporarily found the right combination of drugs to relieve the ear pain ( it was horrible last night ) , but I still have several other symptoms that are very annoying and rather debilitating.1 ) Sore throat . I was able to relieve the earache / toothache , but the throat is STILL sore . This is the longest I ' ve had a sore throat since I had my tonsils out when I was in grade eight . I told the doctor yesterday that I had a sore throat , but he did n't even look at my throat.2 ) Cough ."
'I am 36 this year ... the marker when miscarriage rates significantly go up ... god help me . I should be content with my son .... but the biological push to reproduce and the grief push to fix the " void " from the loss of my babies .... keeps the debate alive in me . Angel \'s abrupt death ... after such a run ... makes the family making feel " unfinished " in me .'
"Join me in trying your hand at bread baking , any loaf will do . Ca n't you just smell that wonderful aroma ? I can hear the crackling of the loaf as its crust sets as I pull it out of the oven . Once when a maintenance worker was working outside my apartment window , I received a knock on the door .

'I was impressed with Obama at the Saddleback Church presidential candidate event . He was thoughtful and humble and gave smart intelligent answers . McCain came out and gave his best public performance this year . He seemed well - prepared and did not look tired and confused as has been the case in some public forums . There were still McCain problems in that instead of having a conversation about important issues he played to the crowd and told stories he must have told hundred of times .'
"I ' m still hoping to lose 5 more lbs . by August and I 'll be content with my weight . I do n't exactly want to look anorexic - I just want to look fit . I want toned arms and a super flat tummy ."
'Terrified , actually . What was he going to do if the Doctor was gone ? How was he going to get back to where he belonged ? For a moment , he could feel hopelessness engulfing him , trying to crush him in its jaws and swallow him alive . No .'

"I rode a bay gelding named TJ , who had a bit of an attitude but we had a blast on the trails . Came back about two hours later and met my mom , and we found out that they had a zebra and a camel . Which .... well , I ' m just not sure what to make of that , but they were adorable ! I 'll post all my pictures in the morning ."
"Hellcat # 1 was very good , had lovely art , and was deemed to be too much fun to pass up . This week , the second part is out and , as with all issues that succeed other issues , it has a recap page . This one follows in the best traditions of the Incredible Hercules and X - Men First Class by being as much fun as the main title . It fills you in on who the character is , what they 're doing and where we left off last time , while also taking a few cues from Patsy 's convoluted and complicated past ."
'There were times that I just needed to not talk . I just needed to sit there and stare off into nothingness for a while . Usually after a while of this , I was OK ... except the fourth day became a bit harder to pull this off .'
"Now I ' m old , tired , and just do n't have the energy for long drawn out fights . After trying several different ideas , such as having him clean the bathroom , do seat - lifting repetitions , and writing sentences to no avail , I solved the problem by leaving the seat up when I ' m done . Because I do n't actually care if he lifts the seat before he pees , I just do n't want to sit in pee ."
"Slowly slowly , I am learning how to understand and forgive myself . And now , my little one needs feeding . It 's weird how I just let my body do it 's thing whilst pregnant - it did the nurturing ; now he 's here , it feels much more like I am in control of looking after his needs , and it 's me who is nurturing him , not just some biological occurrence . Also feeling more connected with my daughter today as she asked for cuddles with me at least 3 times - something she has n't done for quite some time ."
"I just told them that the most important part is that you are responsible about it . That we were always taught to respect it and when we were old enough we were taught the proper way to use it . They did n't have much to say about that ."
"I wondered aloud today whether I should worry about all the blood I ' m losing to karate bruises . Beth said it was probably good for my body because it forces me to produce clean , fresh blood . So I got some fresh bruises on my lower legs and upper arms today . Ironically , I ad pads on my lower legs , but still managed to bruise them soundly ."

"I kind of let him know this too , by informing him that I did n't care who he was . Would he himself wake up on the right side of the bed if he 'd been woken up out of a sound sleep just for some of his stuff to be taken and for the rest of it to end up in shambles ? I had asked him . He never did write me up , though ."
'I hate using baby gates for the dog . Unfortunetly , between the rack and the desk still sitting in my car I might have to start researching legal steroids ! That stuff is heavy ! !

"Was epic . This may or may not be the reason I have n't left the house since Sunday night . I got the flu , or some shit . It was the much anticipated formal on Friday night , and it was alright . Everyone looked amazing , but afterwards was slightly funner ."
'I am not sure how long into the race I decided to remove my mud caked glasses and accept the occasional speck of dirt to the iris . It was dirt through the eyes or trying to catch a glimpse of the action through the mud coated lenses . The course was wet and muddy and racers were all over the place .'
"I ' ve had a vision of what I wanted my huge bare wall in my family room to look like for quite some time now . And I finally was motivated to get it up and done before Ryan 's birthday party . So my wonderful and devoted husband stayed up way past his bedtime ( I even went to bed before he was done ) , and hung all my photos for me . He even got half - way done and then had to start all over again because I had n't told him exactly how I wanted it ."
"thinking more about my own book . it would be so surprisingly simple to implement if i had a saleperson in place ... i am just questioning which town / region and which topic . i googled dining guide and the chamber of commerce looks to have put one out , but not since ' 04-'05 - can that be right ? why would they not continue ?"

"My friends in the Obama cheering section get huffy about them , while filtering from their consciousness all the dishonest ads Obama has run - the demagogic DHL ad , the insulting computer ad , the cynical Rush Limbaugh ad , the misleading Social Security ad and so on . If one candidate has sunk lower than the other at this point , I ' ve lost track . No , what disappoints me about the McCain campaign is it has no central argument ."

"It 's been four days since I had it done . Surely the pain will go away soon ? If not , there 'll be another trip to the dentist in my future . Little L goes to register at Kindergarten today ."
"It was n't easy and sometimes , it 's still not easy . I think there are times we forget how hard we can be on the people we love and how hard the people we love can be on us . There 's danger in trying to protect the people we love from ourselves - I do n't mean in an abusive sense - but rather in the sense that we ca n't share our fears , our anxieties and our frustrations . When we do n't want to expose the people or the person in our lives to the part of ourselves that we consider negative ."

'The marathoners were off . The convoy of machine gun - toters was leading the way . I only know this because I stuck my hand in the air to take pictures . I would look down at the exposure and see what was happening .'
"Last night I dreamed that I was in the bath with George . We do this all the time in real life , but in the dream something very weird happened . My consciousness sort of split into two , and the main part of it moved into George 's body . I was sitting there looking out of George 's eyes , and I could see myself sitting at the other end of the bath , but in a strange sort of way I was also still in my own body and able to control it . Unsurprisingly , the first thing that came to my attention was that I suddenly had an extra ... appendage ."

"Little perks can make a big difference , and they are n't always just perks . Letting employees take time off for doctor 's appointments , or letting people come in a hour later and leave an hour later if that suits their lifestyle better . I think in today 's business world , the idea is that you can treat people like dogs ( or worse than dogs - dogs have gourmet organic food these days ) ."

"We climbed to the East Peak of Mt. Tam and back from SF on this fine Labor Day afternoon ( about 50mi ) . I did n't think I was able to do it ( it 's a 2.4 kft hill ) , but we did it anyway . I do n't know about the others but I had to push myself ( although it might not look it !"
'Actually , we were kinda sick of the place as its environment is not that comfortable . It was a bit hot and the place is old . We were glad that we were informed dinner would be served at the Bill Fish bistro by the pool , which is nearer to our hotel The deserted beach Instead of watching the boys to play water polo , I decided to walk about beach myself and took some photos . The sun was a bit unbearable , so I decided to go back to my room to catch up with some winks of sleep .'

"I have n't read up on the process or the pros and cons about it , but I do know ppl who have gone through it unscathed and my Dr. has assured me that there is nothing wrong with having a baby by that method . I think it would be better because everytime the two of us are measured , they keep telling me how big he is . Granted , I have n't gained a lot of weight so far with this pregnancy . Only thirteen pounds so far , which I think is fabulous . Most horror stories I hear are of women gaining roughly fifty pounds ."
"After lunch we play a bit more then pack up Fe and his stuff and head to Southampton where we unload allllllllllll Felix 's stuff and hand him back to Michael . Though he is very reluctant to be handed back and cries a lot and keeps reaching out for me and clings on when I hold him :( This made it even harder on me and I was in bits anyway , I could hardly bring myself to let him go . My heart = destroyed . Gav drives home as I a crying too hard ."
"Stepping inside , she slightly brushed Casey 's hand and Casey could feel goose bumps appear on her arm .

"I think she is probably in a great deal of pain , as she is sleeping a lot . She also appears frustrated at having to re - learn how to walk , especially when she is sleepy . The vet has been closed since we picked her up Wednesday , so tomorrow we will call and see if she should be on pain medication . She does better when she finally wakes up at walking about , but she 's been sleeping really heavily lately and frequently prefers to go back to sleep to waking up ."
"I ' m sending her some of the size mediums we bought because she is poor and I am not . I think that foster parents need support . I included a teddy bear in the box so the baby girl can have one of her own . When the mom sent me her address she said she was crying because she 's so grateful ."
"Secondly , she ordered a bunch of tests , which should be helpful one way or another , but other than that , I do n't expect that yesterday 's visit will do anything for me . Wednesday when I had acupuncture , my kids were being so boisterous that I called my oldest daughter in to my little curtained off area to give her a little talking to . I figured she 'd be able to handle seeing me all voodoo - dolled - up so that 's why I called her in ."

"Try it for yourself . I also factored in the fact that my portfolio should continue to grow even while I ' m in retirement , so it has to be large enough to allocate part of it to continuous growth . I think medical expenses are likely to be substantially more than they are today , since there 's no realistic fix to the health care crisis in sight . Finally , retirement is supposed to be very , very fun ; there 's no point in retiring if it means sitting around and staring at the wall all day ."
'A friend of mine is getting remarried . The first marriage was a marriage of convenience between the both of them but outside the marriage everyone thought it was a marriage of love . She needed to leave her home because her father was / is an alcoholic and VERY abusive and he is gay but no one in the family knew and if they found out he would be 1- kicked out of the family [ disowned ] and 2- kicked out of the will [ they are LOADED ! ] . They were best friend and so gree on being married in church but lives separate lives DISCREETLY .'

"Even then he kept a wary eye out in case one of his siblings had randomly decided to have lunch there . Over the last day or two , Ginny 's situation had been going around in his head , and it made it all the more important that no one know about this bewildering turn of events yet . Not at least until he and Ang had calmed down enough to discuss their options sensibly . Lists had to be made ."
'around four - fifteen i left my home for the local tucan - themed restaurant and got paid to exchange food and services for credit and paper legal tender . as a result of my previous eureka on politics i had been spending much of my time thinking about other games that we humans play such as relationship games . a second result of this eureka was a heightened self - awareness .'
"I do n't know why , but I suspect it 's because at night it 's dark , and he has become used to falling back asleep , like we all do at night . During the day when it 's light , he wakes up and ca n't put himself back to sleep yet . The other bad thing is that until now , I ' ve let him take his afternoon nap in the swing , which is becoming a problem because I think he is fast approaching the weight limit ( I ' m fairly certain the limit is 20 lbs , and he was 16 about three weeks ago ) . So pretty soon , there will be no swing to nap in ."
"It seems every day in summer is almost same . Hot and unbearable swelters as if were the symbol of summer days for the in - door people like me though I am not introvert in reference to my personality , provided personality was closely associated with people 's predilection toward weather . Nearly 3 months ago , I have traveled between daytime school and home mainly and I have witnessed the gradual changes of weather at tbe turn of season to summer ."

"Better than it is on TV . The stadium is pretty small and so steep , so you still get to see everything , and they show the TV coverage on the screens in the stadium . Oh , oh , and I think I saw Roger Federer ! After the Serena / Safina match was over , two guys came on the court and started practicing , and one of them was wearing a jacket and cap , but he totally had Federer 's hair . We asked a usher who he was , but he said they were junior players ."

"Apparently ( keep in mind , I ' m not good with the car talk ) , a rod blew , creating a spark in the engine which set the oil on fire . We grabbed all our stuff out of the car in case it blew up , and called the fire dept . We also called Aaron and Amy to turn around and come rescue us ."
'I was there when they first met Dr. Lawson - and instantly their attitude about the whole event seemed to shift . At the Rally the next day , they came back for another interview , and again , the reporter seemed very impressed .

I knew Obama would have troubles getting things done because he has not been around as long as most politicians have been when they make this kind of attempt at the presidency . But I also know that Clinton has been so deep into politics that not only is she surely a little dirty , but she has a massive hate club . There is a huge base of powerful people in Washington ( mostly Republicans , duh ) that will never do anything to help anything Hillary does just because of who she is , no matter how sound her ideas .'

Until , that is , now . The situation was thus : McKay being his normal sarcastic , condescending , conceited self , and Lorne just really having had enough of it . And it was n't that he even disliked the guy anymore , because he 'd pretty well learned to first tolerate , and then eventually actually even appreciate him ."
'His pleas are unconvincing . He heard the door open and close again while he was just around the corner . He was the last one there , ultimately having worn the most after the midnight battle on the Dauntless . Layers of clothes under that brocade , a wig that had kept him in makeup for hours , it was long past the time that any of his coworkers should have been there .'
'Well it started to rain and there was lightning , and at the end of the 20 minutes they decide to have an hour break . So everyone started leaving , going to their cars , and such . So we went back to the car and at the end of the hour break , it was still storming , so they decide to wait another 45 minutes . But after that they finally got it started again .'
"It was totally automated and it frustrated me and so when I got home I decided that I was going to get a completely manual camera and I bought this interesting Chinese made twin lens reflex camera - an old fashioned camera that you used to see in the 1950 's . I started making pictures with it and because of that , I became interested in fine art photography . Soon after that , I went to a bookstore and I got a book of photographs by Edward Weston . The book actually changed my life ."
"I have to add some things that I just remembered ... because it makes me feel like a girl , and even though it 's weird for me ... it was also kind of nice this week . The morning of the wedding we all got our hair done and ran last - minute errands and such ... ( I got my freaking hair done first ... at 7 am . Ughhhh . Sucks being the responsible one !"
"We would walk around the village looking for secluded spots to french kiss one another . I do n't remember if I liked it or not . We talked about ' sleeping together ' and I do n't remember it crossing my mind that at 14 I was too young ."
"When I got to work this morning , I knew something big was afoot . All the women were swooning and had that look of ravenous hunger in their eyes . I knew that look was n't reserved for me , so I fired up my web browser and quickly figured out what had set all the hearts of the lady - folk in my building aflutter . It did n't take long to find the answer ."

'Looks like someone got access to my myspace page and rather than a virus thing that posts random bulletins , my profile joined several myspace groups and actually posted something non - computer / machine like in a few of them . Some of the groups joined and added were to my interest , and some were pure " what the hell " and random . I resigned to about 40 groups , and I found out that there are a few groups that are " waiting for approval " with those private groups or something . I figured something was up with my profile or something when random people wanted to add me and sent weird messages .'
"I felt strong . Dare I say it , I even felt pretty while I was out there . I have n't felt any of those things for a few months now ."
'In the end I decided to make the balls 2.5 oz each ( 30 oz ) and use the remainder for the two ropes : 9 oz each . Once I shaped the balls and placed them on parchment in two triangles of six ( bases touching ) , I used a tape measure to figure out how long my outside ropes needed to be : 40 inches . Now I was very happy with my new 36 " maple countertop ( see other posts ) . I could just roll these out on the diagonal .'

'Allowing that the gospels contain " stories which we may reasonably suspect of being metaphysical fables " , Swinburne insists that they are " a basically reliable source of information about the life of Jesus " . Of course , Jesus did not go about saying , " I am God " , yet " the historical evidence of the actions as well as the words of Jesus are such as we would expect if Jesus did teach that he was divine " . Thus , Jesus was not revealed to be divine only at the Resurrection , or in the Easter experience of the disciples , as some theologians would maintain .'
"Luckily I noticed -.- ; My grandparents had gone out for Sunday lunch and I ' m practically oblivious to everything but what 's in front of me . I think my reaction was rather robotic :/ I just looked at the smoke , picked up the dog 's water bowl that 's by the back door and just poured it over it . That was it ."

"Reading the numerous and powerful responses from community organizers to political insults of their work , it occurs to me that such words slight Faith In Public Life 's work organizing diverse religious leaders across the country . We can deal with the derision -- it wo n't stand in the way of our work for the common good . But the ignorance on display presents a teachable moment ."

'The Dragon of Thunder She would look out the window on a stormy night , waiting for him . The drops would splash onto the sill and onto her lips ; which reminded her that raindrops tasted like tears but without the pain . She knew of tears , for she would lie in bed at night crying , thinking of him . At night she could feel him in the room with her and at times lightly touching her face only to open her eyes and find nothing .'
"The show was nuts . I have n't been to a show in a long time -- I kind of remember why , and I also kind of do n't regret it . Like , it was a lot of fun , but I was n't in the mood to get loose . After the show Taya and I chatted with strangers , but this time I actually participated , and made a new friend who had been in one of my classes last quarter ."

"They just did n't talk , & & new viewers would probably guess that the two were n't even friends . Hodgins did seem a little quieter , but that was it . I was extremely disappointed about this . I was also annoyed at Brennan 's new assistant , Daisy ."
'He too though was enthusiastic about everything I suggested and could make a good impact if he continues to get support . The volunteer teachers were a bit of a different matter and I had to keep constantly reminding myself that they have no training and are paid barely anything . The standard of english of the teacher in St3 was very poor and certainly her teaching of english was barely worth doing as the children would be no further forward at the end of St3 as they had been at the start . This I just found very upsetting for the children as they were so desperate to learn and for the fact that from St5 they are supposed to be solely taught in english which they would not be ready for .'

'As of today , more than 6000 warriors have been discovered . The archeologists believe that there are perhaps as many as 10 000 warriors in the area . Other than the sheer size of Pit 1 ( larger than 2 football fields ) , the most amazing aspect is that each warrior is unique . They have different facial hair , body types , and even different footwear .'
'Parents of 48 children ( 31 boys , 17 girls ) were interviewed . The main distressing symptoms were fatigue , pain , loss of appetite , and dyspnoea according to the parents .

'She then woke us up and told us that they said the roads were fine but we need to go in as soon as we could because the backroom was flooded . When we got there it was a lot worse than we expected . Apparently when the managers got to the store there was 1/4 inch of water standing in the back room and it had come at on the floor past all the text books and onto the carpeted area . As it saturated boxes and cardboard stands , they fell and made things worse .'
"I tried to take pictures of each state 's sign as we entered but some states are delinquent and do n't have their sign for MILES , and some of those delinquent states have little tiny signs that make it HARD FOR ME TO ACCOMPLISH MY GOALS . I blame state government for this ; I know if the presidents had their way we 'd have some uniformly awesome state signs with MUCH more clever state slogans . Ohio : We 're not as boring as Indiana ! West Virginia : A nice place to visit , but ..."

We spent Sunday in full - wedding mode , flicking through bridal mags , looking things up on the internet and watching the best wedding movie of them all , Muriel 's Wedding .

"About a half hour before I was about to leave work , I got a call from my mom saying there was a small bush fire in the canyon .

"baking powder and 1/2 tsp . salt for every cup of flour . Just measure the baking powder and the salt in the bottom of the measuring cup , and spoon flour over it until you get one cup . I served this with homemade apricot jam and bacon . I had butter on the table too , but the hoe cake was so good on its own ( because of all the shortening and oil ) that the butter was n't necessary ."
"It was a great discussion , and Mary seemed to be enjoying herself too . I have to say , I love the idea of being an author who talks to book groups -- it seems like something that would be really fun ( if occasionally embarrassing ) . So I 'll add that to my personal goal list . After having just come back from Worldcon and hearing from / talking with lots of SFF authors of varying stripes , it was really interesting to have a similar conversation with / get a feel for the career path of someone totally * not * in the genre . Some author experiences clearly transcend genre ( e.g."
"It all boils down to DON'T SLEEP AT 2AM IN THE HOLIDAYS ! Red Cross Chalet was darn amusing since now I finally know of a location with 4 rooms instead of the usual measely 2 which is not at all sufficient most of the time . Just that the abundance of female mosquitoes sucks because they really bite . And the three hormonal cats which freaked some juniors out and that black and white one who stared at us take photos today ."
"I was surprised to say the least , I never thought that would happen , feeling so weighted by feelings I have n't felt in 10 plus years but it was what I needed . I did n't fight through it I just went with it , I let my body move the way it wanted and tell the story it had been dying to tell . Because it threw me for such a loop I danced to it again in my normal class , not because I did n't have anything else to dance to but because I felt I was n't done . There was more and I wanted to see what would happen ; would I break down again ?"

'But despite the logic his teacher attempted to bring into the matter , and even after her parents urged Miyagi to move on and forget about her -- he never did . After her death , he began building up a wall between himself and others . He viewed the world in complete indifference , going with the flow of things . His marriage was brief and unsuccessful , it resulted in a divorce when his wife cheated on him and left him . After the break - up , she confesses to Miyagi that she truly had loved him .'

'Our RD was in the building , so she technically ran shift , but for a long time she was working with a student who was screaming her head off in the timeout space , so I wound up managing a lot of transitions and staffing within our program . It was kinda neat . So those are the good days . I just wish that people would communicate . So much goes on , and nobody tells me , and that makes for some crappy moments .

"I ' ve been inspired by people lately , mainly women from church . A friend from one of my former small groups quit her unfulfilling job so she can work at a therapeutic horse riding center .

I pressed her on this , how did she know God was talking to her ?"

'Long and short of it is that we are arressted and thrown in jail . Strangely , in this country , there is no separated cells , so Tabetha and I are in the same cell together . Several weeks pass , but each time our food is delivered to us ( which very oddly , is a # 1 meal from McDonald \'s ) - we are told that the " Oracle " will make a judgment on us soon . At the outset of what seemed to be the final week , the guards remove us and begin taking us down a rather tedious long hallway .'
'But to the Modern Liberal who can not make that judgment - must not make that judgment - that would be discriminating . They have no explanation . Therefore , the only explanation for success has to be that somehow success has cheated .'

'We were situated opposite a temple and on a scooter route which proved to be quite entertaining . As we were staying in a residential area close to the hotel there were plenty of roadside stalls with food . Feeling still quite green we decided not to brave it and ate at the hotel . The food was great though the music alternated between Country and Western , Celine Dion and Mariah Carrey . I now understand what people mean by an authentic pad thai .'

"It 's part of Will 's plan to drive his parents crazy . She manages to hold in the giggle until she 's safe in Will 's room , door closed , her back pressed against it . She covers her mouth with her hand but Will still wakes up , giving her a sleepy smile that makes her forget he 's sick . He does n't say anything , just quirks an eyebrow at her and she bounces across the room , into the bed .

"Although there were no fewer than three different public Harry Potter parties here in town last night , I did n't go to any of them . Some small children needed to be in bed by then , and besides , my copy was sitting safely at the public library , ready for me to pick it up this morning . I set my alarm clock for 7:30 , planning to get up , have breakfast , and be at the library at 8:30 when they opened . Well , I turned the alarm clock off and fell back asleep until 8:20 ."

"He was left home with my mom and then transported up here after one week , in a quart Chinese - food container with air holes in the lid . This container was in a padded box with no lid , which was then sandwiched inside a bigger box between the front seat and the dashboard . He literally did n't move except for the relative rocking of the car as it moved , so I do n't think that it stressed him all that much . My friend was careful to keep the temperature in his car above 70 the whole time he was driving up here ( much to his chagrin , as it was pretty warm , haha ) ."
"My thumb is still sore from working my TV remote overtime last night , and from a tennis game with my son . After watching the Red Sox score 10 runs in last night 's 1st inning , I decided that it was time to do something else because the suspense of the outcome of last night 's game was gone , ( or at least I thought so ) , and so I would record the Olympics to later watch the Women 's gymnastics . So , my youngest son and I headed to the local tennis court - rain ? We were n't going to let wet courts stop us from playing a couple of sets under the lights ."
"Or worse , on Parenting magazines . If you think mom 's with well behaved children are rare and living in a sheltered world , please consider for a moment that what you think is normal , does n't have to be . And trust me , I ' ve screwed up ( am screwing up ) plenty . I have learned a lot about Grace through the years , but nearly soon enough for my boys . I was an overly firm parent when they were younger had much of their obedience came out of fear of punishment rather than a love of goodness . I want them to embrace God 's commands out of a love of His word , not a fear of hell ."
"I had trouble putting it down so I could actually get things done . I was thrown of balance a little by the very end though , for reasons which I will put under a cut to avoid spoilers for anyone wanting to read it . The antagonist was of course completely insane .

"I then took a flight to Germany , took a another 1.5 hour bus ride to an enourmous train station and took a 3 hour train ride to Basel , where the Careys ( the family I am staying with ) picked me up . Once again , I was n't tired , clearly the grace of God at work cause only with a working brain could someone like me travel such a distance without getting lost :) Since arriving in Germany , I ' ve had a wonderful time . friday I went to lunch at an awesome countryside cafe that serves only locally grown stuff .

I am now 47 , morbidly obese and damn tired of it . About a year and a half ago I revisited some of the research and plans I had followed in my more fit years and used it as a jumping off point to find the perfect formula for a highly efficient method of losing weight while increasing strength , endurance , and flexibility . These traits are what I now desire for my performance standards ."

'He put more quarters between all my fingertips , with my hands behind my back , and told me to sit there for twenty minutes . My arms hurt before too long , and the sense of loneliness and anger sank into me , and made me cry and cry . For a time , it stopped , until one of the quarters fell from between my pinkies .

"All I did was say I snapped because I had a fucking bad day . Sorry for making it all about me and being a selfish bitch by explaining in a few words like ' i snapped at you because i had a bad day ' why I snapped at you .

"After we 'd cruised around for an hour or so , I got hot . I realized I was surrounded by water ( duh ) but would have to let go of one of my random oddities of never touching foot in the lake .

While some Liberals are clearly fiscal conservatives in the Canadian context ( and note that both liberal and conservative have quite different meanings - much more to the left - than in the US ) others really believe in center left principles . The NDP could pick up their support all over the country . With a well run campaign and a little luck Jack Layton and a team of good candidates will be the spoiler in this election .

What I did n't understand was the $ 100 mail in rebate was n't available for people under 2 years - is that true ? I do n't really know what the mail in rebate is about - is it online anywhere for me to see the terms and conditions ?

"Also the groom was standing at the front but kept his back to the door the whole time the bride was walking in , until she arrived at the front , at which point I guess he felt he could turn around . This also seemed a bit strange , is n't the whole point of the bride walking in is so that the groom can see her enter ? Or watch her or something ? I did n't really get it ."
'A friend who did NOT forget her birthday ! I feel like such a moron . Her response when I finally realized ... somewhere around 7 was , " you \' ve got lots going on . " not an excuse ( although , honestly , I knew it was coming up , but thought I still had a week - thought it was next Monday ) !'

South of the Columbia and Franklin pike our troops were in some degree successful in capturing part of the line of works ; the Federals who survived this onslaught took refuge behind the works on the north side of the pike , in our front . Our numbers were too weak on that portion of the line to charge the position in our front with any hope of success ; however , they succeeded in reaching the brick houses I have described .'

'There is some solace in thinking this way , I suppose , because we can believe that there are no faceless enemies out there . Only the enemy next door , the one we know . That is more comforting , I suppose . The attacks changed the world . From the way we travel to the way we see the world . But as I sit and type this , a blue jay calls out , the wind shakes leaves from trees , and a lawnmower is heard in the distance . When there are no words to say , it is best just to listen .'
"I can not recall posting this story here so apologies if I did . But it 's come up in conversation a few times so I have to write it here . My last boyfriend was renting a room from a very nice , but not terribly bright lady ."
'I was living in another city when the brutal attacks took place . I had just woken up and turned on the television to check the weather when I saw the report that a plan had struck . I called out to my fiance that a plan hit a building in New York thinking it was just a pilot error not knowing yet of how the entire world was about to change . We watched the news update and tried to figure out how a pilot hit such a noticeable landmark when the second plane made contact .'

"Given the way the rest of my hair grew back when I shaved , I ' m a little fearful that I could be opening to door to a shade and texture of facial hair I ' m not ready for , and a whole new level of masculine presentation . For the time being , I ' m just plucking my chin hair as it appears , and trying to learn to love that part of my body as it is . As for the hair on my head , that evolution mirrored more my coming out process . When I was younger , the hair on my head was long , flowing almost to my waist , and even when it got shorter ( mid back to shoulder length ) , it was either in a ponytail , plastered to my head , or in French braids ."
'Jesus I ve already broken my fast and its quarter past 11 in the morning ! I reasoned with myself that it would be better to eat breakfast to boost my metabolism today until I research none food ways to that on my laptop later . So , so far today I ve eaten some cinnamon grahams .'
'Ok I watched a movie in my anthropology class called " In who \'s honor " It was pretty much about Native Americans being used as sports mascots and after watching it I feel horrible I seriously ca n\'t remember feeling this shook up and angry about something . The worst thing is two years ago it had never even occurred to me how wrong it is to have Indians as mascots . I saw how ignorant those people were who were supporting their school \'s " symbol " and I just kept thinking how I had been ignorant too and it makes me want to cry .'

Rowdy , on the other hand , was a fun party guy and her favorite playmate . She 'd never considered giving him up , not until last night . Jerry had been so worn - out from his summer job it 'd almost been funny ."

'Both of the castles were built by this crazy king in the 1800s with a serious ego issue . There is a bridge you can hike to that gives you a sweet view of Neuschwanstein . So we went and this bridge was soo sketchy ! It was about a million feet in the air across this gorge and it was a metal body with just wooden planks across it . John was being a jerk and bouncing on the planks and stuff .'

'As I had anticipated , the wheater had been much too good in Prince Rupert . When I got to Port Hardy , after 15 hours on the boat , it rained .

'I once lived on air . And I loved it . And I hated it . You see I lived on air after a long time of gasping for it , so at that particular moment in my life , air was good .'
"Put your shoes away , or close the bedroom door . If ( as is the case in some older houses ) the air wo n't circulate without the door open , invest in a babygate . The pressure - mounted ones are very inexpensive , and if the chewing only happens when you 're away , there 's no need to keep it up all the time . If you want something easier to open , there are numerous ones available from hardware stores and catalogues like Dr Fosters & Smith , many of which are very nice looking ."
'The homes in Lake Forest Keys are a lot less expensive this year than last ! A short sale was just posted as closed today at $ 725,000 for a home that had sold almost exactly a year ago for $ 1,250,000 ! That is definitely not good news for the comps in the neighborhood .'
'Saturday evening , our large dog ( part great pry , part white golden retriever ) , Rain , was trying to jump over the backyard fence . The last time she did this ( successfully too , she got nice and lost in the neighborhood ) was when we first got her , before she realized this was her home . After I banged on the window and she briefly hid behind the compost , I went outside to figure out what was freaking her out . What had her shivering with a need to flee ?

"I conscripted Christian to help me move the couch downstairs and in the process we got orange powder all over us . And do n't get me started about what was under the couch .

"So about the puppy ... I would have posted more yesterday , but I also got a fantastically horrible stomach virus yesterday , and it was just making me completely useless when I made that post . Anyways no one care about my sick tummy , you all just want to hear about the puppy . It 's ok I understand . She is an 8 week old black lab / shephard mix . She has a little bit of that choclate coloring to her in the sunlight , and she has a white streak going down her chest . We went to Operation Kindness , which is a local no kill shelter about 5 minutes from us , with the intention of looking to consider adopting , and well , she suckered me in ."
"She had n't let him know about how exactly she had ' mismanaged ' her estate , nor did she think he needed to know . The newfound knowledge of the discord between her parents , however , deeply troubled Marian . Typically , when upset , she would charge out in the night and give charity to unsuspecting peasants . Between the thrill of danger , evading the sheriff 's or Gisborne 's men , and the contentedness from filling the needs of the sick or poor , a single good midnight escapade could leave her in spirits for a week . Her father 's command that she stop that activity felt like imprisonment ."

'Marie - Antoinette had a great love for children . Many biographies , including the most recent by Lady Antonia Fraser , while diverging on other points , do agree that Marie - Antoinette was truly fond of the company of small boys and girls . As a young girl , she asked her ladies and servants to bring their children with them when in attendance ; hence the scene in her apartments was a bit chaotic with all the little ones running about , not to mention all the dogs .'

"The KMT won the Presidential Election in Taiwan , which will undoubtedly regress what it means to be Taiwanese as the nation attempts to grow closer to China .

On a brighter note , I ' ve forced Cori into watching Battlestar Galactica with me , as I ' m not going to be able to shut up about it once the final season starts in two weeks . Unfortunately for her , that means she has to watch two seasons in two weeks ."

"I feel like throwing something fragile . THEN , I got confused and thought Project Runway came on Thursdays , so it was quite the let - down after an already disappointing day when I tuned in and Kathy Griffin was all over my tv set .

'The Spurs are losing . With the lights off , and sound barely audible , and for no known reason , I watch the rest of the game . We lose , our season ends , but at least I know the score .

"But the fact that she did n't even let me know hurt . Then someone a few nights ago basically pointed the finger at me as if I was the bad guy for wanting to take care of myself .

Second round he won again with the ' in plain sight ' strategy .

'It looked as if sunlight that had been stored in the sky begging to be let out . It was late afternoon ; the winter sun angles low , casting beautifully elongated shadows . The sun was piercing through storm clouds and when I glanced up at the hills , there was a mighty rainbow .

'We arrived in Bermuda , tired from a red - eye and overwhelmed by the humidity but thrilled to be there . ( By the way , cankles are the new black . Just saying . ) Bermuda did not disappoint . We traipsed around the Bermuda Aquarium , Museum and Zoo , in a heavy rain much like many of my excursions to the Oregon Zoo , except it was a bajillion degrees . Some of us were forced against our will to try traditions that make us a little queasy .'

"I left early from work with a migraine today . I had n't had one since college , and in high school I had one about every six months . The onset of symptoms are the worst - first , you have a splitting headache . No worries , I took some Aleve that I had in my cabinet in the office . Did n't work . It 's the sense of your mind fighting against you , maddening and frightening at the same time ."
"I had no idea what gotten into me ... it was the most bizarre thing ! That night I got into an argument with my brother . I lost it and let him have it ...

"We also write news releases , write and edit a corporate magazine and newsletter , devise marketing campaigns and advertisements , do market research - if it has to do with words , we do it . A workshop I attended early in my new career provided an insight I ' ve found helpful . Studies have found that an engineer 's biggest fear is to appear stupid . That translates into a fear of asking questions - because he / she might look stupid ."

"I can usually function when I am sick as long as I can breath through my nose right . It is probably on my Top Ten Most Annoying Things In Life List when I ca n't breath normally .

So last night as I was complaining to my dad , mom , grandma and aunt ( who are visiting from out of town and brought me all my favorite Utah - only treats particularly my aunt 's famous homemade caramels ! Thank you , Kash ! )"
"It was so crammed that my face is a mere few inches away from that of and Asian man , and a middle Eastern man . The middle Eastern had his back to us while the Asian and I faced each other .

'The food was great , the conversations very satisfying . Deer Island was reached solely by a simple but fascinating car ferry set up . Ted and I explored the main roads of the 7 mile long mostly wooded island , ate at one of the few businesses and spent some extended time in a quiet cove of cold clear water and a cool close - by cliff . We spent an equally quiet but fascinating time on a local wharf ; where I spent the entire time taking detailed pictures of the pier , boats , and gulls , and Ted sat on a bench soaking up the afternoon sun and dozing for 1/2 hour .'

"We spent almost 6 hours loading the rental truck that night , and moved everything in the morning . We started life in our new home together without any appliances ( since we had to reschedule the Best Buy delivery ) , no curtains , and water that had to be shut off from the main everytime we were done using it b / c of a slow leak .

We were sent to West Philly , which is a fairly run - down sort of neighborhood but which is also a tightly - knit community where the residents are eager to talk about what 's going on in their lives .

The highlight was definitely coming across a group of kids playing on a porch who sang us a song they 'd written about Obama ."
"Mohinder gasped softly as he watched the serum disappear from the tube and into his veins . It felt strange for a few moments after ... tingly . Mohinder wondered how he 'd test it , then he thought that he could at least take a sample of his own blood to see if anything had changed within .

'I did find out that kellers is a total entry level michael jackson fan , and well that s kind of a let down to be honest .... DJ followed us back to my place and we had a few drinks and hung out .

"So , because of the recent notice I turned in , I ' ve been more vigilant on behalf of work -- lies of course , I ' ve always been vigilant , I just do n't regret it as much .

"It was really hard on me , but I watched myself and tried to stick to a steady routine . I was even better this past september , when I went to school for my senior year . I 'd worked out and exercised over the summer , and I felt better than ever , since I 'd lost thirty pounds . Not even three weeks into the school year , though , I got yet ANOTHER mono - like virus . It caused a serious relapse ."

"I like to think I ' m a little bit of a tech head when it comes to the computer & other electronics . But for the life of me I could not figure out my camera phone . I ' ve had it for a year and was able to take pics with it and save them in my phone , but I had no idea how to upload them to the computer .

'The worst part is I slept on my stomach in some really weird position with my hands squished up under my ribcage , so I had this awful aching feeling under my chest above my tum tum .

"It was pretty exciting . I ' ve toyed with the idea of offering myself up as a picker for the Best 's , because occasionally I feel the need to better acclimate myself with the outdoors , and also I just think it would be interesting to say I 'd done it .

"I jokingly asked if there are any psycho exes that I am going to need to avoid . She laughed and explained that she had n't seen her ex - husband in over 4 years now .

About a day later , he was dead . He deserves to be remembered .

"My father started a new job yesterday at a nursing home and during orientation saw a Pekinese run past . This was n't too much of a jolt to him given the many nursing homes that regular take in rescues or have therapy animals paraded through their doors , but he inquired about the pooch and it turns out said pup accompanies his master daily to work at the home . Without really thinking , my dad blurted out that he is the happy owner of a retired guide dog , whom he is a bit concerned about leaving at home for such long periods as she 's getting on in years and may need to relieve more often and probably should be a bit less of a couch potato ."

On a purely personal level , it was very satisfying to stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the crew and step up .'

'He does all He can , as a loving Father , to get that nasty sin out of their lives . He would rather they suffer now than for eternity . And when His children suffer , we can know that He does , too . Funny thing ... if you keep reading in Lamentations 1 , verse 21 , you will read something very interesting ...

"Why does this always happen ? You give your heart to someone , then when you leave for just a split second to claim yourself , they yank it out , spit on it , then jam it back in your chest ( that 's how it feels , at least , for me ) . This journey , I think , will have to end here ."
"It looks exactly like all the photos , the houses are all small cottages that make me think of The Brothers Grimm or Hansel and Gretel . At least I am only at school for a little bit . I always thought that this part of the trip would be the worst part of it all , living with strangers is always a bit weird , but for most of the time I am out or going somewhere with at least one other Aussie person , so that is okay , even though most of the people here are n't close friends , or I did n't even know them before this trip .

'She argues that , as a consequence of this denial , illness has never gathered its own vocabulary , leaving the ill without language to express their experiences : " The merest schoolgirl , when she falls in love , " argues Woolf , " has Shakespeare or Keats to speak her mind for her ; but let a sufferer try to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry . " . Examining her own familiarity with illness , Woolf undertakes a rigorous , compassionate , and droll investigation of how illness shapes the identity of a sick patient , particularly the invalid , not only affecting his or her perceptions of the world but also awakening the helplessness of being unable to convey those perceptions , or the effects of illness , to others . .'

'I can sit beside the box and Cinderella can not see me as well , so I will not serve as a distraction . The next advantage that I found is that the food can be administered through a hole in the side of the box . Not only does this eliminate the issue of Cinderella associating getting food with the sight of my hand , but the food also travels a shorter distance relating in less sound . The food is also not bouncing all over the box when it is dropped .'
"Recitation was fabulous again . We sat outside under my old window in the grass like hippies . We went over the theme of having a core to one 's being , as presented in Blind Chance and Tapestry ."
'Today at lunch my co - worker and I were waiting for our sandwiches at the cafe next door . I was telling her about how I have been looking on Craigslist for a dining room table - but every time I respond to an ad the seller tells me they already have 2 or 3 people interested ahead of me .

"Last night I finished reading the book Brilliant Interview which showed I could have answered a couple of questions yesterday better .

"Definitely did n't sing very well , which disappointed me greatly , but I danced with flying colors ( a byproduct of dancing for two weeks straight at rehearsals maybe ? ) .

Mine was stolen ) ."

"He had turned and caught her staring , of course , and Wendy had frowned and looked down at her work , trying to blink away the tight feeling in her stomach . Hodges is not attractive , at least not the way Wendy is .

Pretty men with shampoo commercial hair and bleached white smiles ."
"We met briefly before but it was n't until the next time we had seen each other that I really saw her . It again was brief but I was conscious to all details .

The plot and the characters and the rising tension and the setting -- everything fitting together perfectly , one piece after another .'

By mid - morning we had arrived in Ottawa where our first stop was at the Canadian Museum of Civilization .

'That is something that I heard recently , and last night , while I could not sleep , I looked out the window at the moon shining down on me . I ca nt say that I felt calm , but I did feel a wonderful connection to something ... I guess it was very peaceful , and I was reminded that the moon is always there , weather I see it or not .

"It was a precious globe , it cost me some money , it was a major prop in my vampire game , and I think it 's quite beautiful . I even named it , and most importantly , it means something to me .

The planes have superb legroom , nice seats , and are n't garish and decked out in horrible yellow and blue ."
"In my dream someone had an idea that I could go through the defense and presentation of my thesis again and this time do it better . I decided that there was no hope for it and that I should eat cake .

I look around and everyone has the hands and feet to themselves .

I asked her if she wanted to decorate a pair of white sneakers herself and she was totally for it . I explained that she would need to do her very best drawing , not rush , and probably think about and practice it all before she started decorating the shoes . I showed her some of my favorite pairs so she could get an idea of what we were talking about .'

Once , when we were in undergrad , four of us decided to go for a movie on a sudden impulse . We had heard that the movie Love ke liye kuch bhi karega was decent time pass . So on it was to the movie theater . At the theater ticket counter , we learnt that the movie had started some 15 minutes ago .

"It just did n't seem right that Bob & Donna should ignore the one person above all who is responsible for their being together . The more I thought about it , the more annoyed I was with them for being so rude . So I emailed them two days before the party and said their not inviting Margo meant that I was in a delicate situation , that it just did n't seem right and could n't they just invite her to have a cocktail beforehand ? My thinking was they 'd see the light and go ahead and invite her to dinner ."

"It 's been a month now since my aunt passed away and honestly , if someone had given me a glimpse into the future before she died , I defiintely would n't have expected things to be the way they are . Sure things are going great at the moment but it 's just overshadowed by this sadness that just won't- and probably will never- go away . In the past month , my family and I have gone through changes- changes that are the most important ever and some that are just so insignificant ."
'Mike retrieved me really fast and I was all showered and clean by the time Mark called after landing . What a frustrating flying day for me .

'As you guys know , I went camping for 2 days and it rocked . Tonight , we decided to go see Son of Rambow . Joey and I were really hyper so we yelled out the window at strangers . I told this one chick at a stopped light who was waiting for her bus that Joey thought she was cute ( she WAS cute , but I impulsively said it without even asking Joey ) . It embarrassed the crap out of him , so while we were driving , he saw a dude and yelled , " HEY !'

And do n't think I do n't feel sympathy towards ill people , but there is one little , annoying detail : Later that presentation day I met him and he was as okay as ever .

"Possum was doing his homework with Jess , Boo Boo was chucking a tantrum - so I took Beaver to our bedroom and had a long chat with him . I told him that , yes , he was the slowest runner in the school . But also the bravest . I told him that maybe he was n't great at soccer , but he 's a good actor .

In 1990 , before the cuts , only 5 per cent of dentists ' earnings came from the private sector ; today it accounts for more than half . And as private practice has grown , so the overriding commitment of the dental profession and its governing body to the NHS has weakened . Throughout the 1990s , one could not question the fervency of the BDA 's support for the NHS , but today the emphasis appears to have changed .

Then on Wednesday morning they reported about 12 areas around the city where roads were closed because of flooding ."
"The main portion of the sites is static , with a blog attached and on one , an RSS news feed into the site . Because they 're on a blogging platform , I was able to add the Entrecard widget and build up more traffic right away . Since I had several sites to promote , and not enough time to spend visiting other sites and dropping my card , I spent $ 50 for 5,000 credits , enabling me to advertise on high traffic blogs right away . This has paid off since you get more credits for clicks received on an ad , and I ' ve received quite a few credits from those high volume sites ."

In the spirit of that , tonight she wears a sparkling pink backless dress for Latin dancing , her hair pinned up in a bun . And being the fancy girl that she is , she even hired a live band for the night , to play some good Latin music to dance to .

I was shooting some video this morning for a possible upcoming episode of the Rob Show , and it is plainly obvious that I ' m developing a bald spot on the back of my head in classic male pattern style .

However , in general , it 's gone great - I ' ve learned loads , I ' ve made new friends and I ' ve settled into my career .

I was actually trying to get the latest weather reports on hurricane season ... but I heard Rudy Giuliani say this : She 's already one of the most successful governors in America - and the most popular .

How dare they question whether Palin will have enough time to spend with her children while vice president ?"
